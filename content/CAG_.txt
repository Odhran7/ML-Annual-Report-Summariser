general 

 

the following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments

 

conagra brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded private branded and valueadded consumer food as well as foodservice items and ingredients we use many different raw materials most of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources from time to time we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and the use of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption

 

we experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets our food items compete with widely advertised wellknown branded food as well as private branded and customized food items some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value product innovation customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty

 

 

demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events for example sales of frozen foods tend to be marginally higher during the winter months seafood sales are highest during lent in advance of the easter holiday and production of certain of our products occurs seasonally during or immediately following the purchase of agricultural crops

 

our intellectual property rights including our trademarks licensing agreements trade secrets patents and copyrights are of material importance to our business and we attempt to protect such rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws as well as entering into licensing thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others including under the pf chang ’ s ® bertolli ® and libby ’ s ® trademarks we also own certain intellectual property rights that are licensed to third parties such as the alexia ® trademark while many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to their terms we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered

 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state local and foreign government agencies including but not limited to the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and the department of labor in particular the processing packaging transportation storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment are each subject to governmental regulation additionally we are subject to data privacy and security regulations tax and securities regulations accounting and reporting standards and other financial laws and regulations we believe that we are in compliance with such laws and regulations in all material respects and do not expect that continued compliance with such regulations will have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is described separately many of the risks are interrelated while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future you should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized

 

covid19 pandemic risks 

 

the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

although we experienced challenges in connection with the covid19 pandemic including temporary closings of production facilities employee illnesses increased costs supply chain interruptions and reduced demand in our foodservice segment to date the pandemic has not had a net negative impact on our liquidity or results of operations however the continued spread of covid19 including new variants could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways in the future these impacts could include but are not limited to

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus the emergence and spread of variants infection rates in areas where we operate the extent and effectiveness of containment actions including the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines in the markets where we operate and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers suppliers distributors and manufacturers should these conditions persist for a prolonged period the covid19 pandemic including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this item 1a risk factors  any of which could have a material effect on us

 

market risks 

 

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine or other geopolitical conflict 

 

the global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between russia and ukraine furthermore governments in the us united kingdom and european union have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in russia although we have no operations in russia or ukraine we have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation energy and raw material due in part to the negative impact of the russiaukraine military conflict on the global economy further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the military conflict including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade could result in among other things cyberattacks supply disruptions lower consumer demand and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain in addition the effects of the ongoing conflict could heighten many of our known risks described in this item 1a risk factors 

 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

 

our business and results of operations have in the past been and may continue to be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation rising interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges the negative impacts caused by pandemics and public health crises including the covid19 pandemic and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions

 

volatility in financial markets including rising interest rates and deterioration of national and global economic conditions has impacted and could continue to impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

credit risks 

 

our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations or returning cash to stockholders 

 

as of may 29 2022 we had total debt of approximately 898 billion including approximately 871 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs make planned capital expenditures and return cash to stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate that our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs make planned capital expenditures or return cash to stockholders

 

our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings in the event of a default the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt

 

recently we have increasingly accessed the commercial paper markets for ongoing funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper additionally disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit markets could also reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs

 

 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us

 

competition risks 

 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

 

the food industry is highly competitive and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases we sell branded private brand and customized food products as well as commercially branded foods our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors in addition when branded competitors focus on price and promotion the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume

 

in addition substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry the expanding presence of ecommerce retailers has impacted and may continue to impact consumer preferences and market dynamics which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits

 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease

 

commodity risks 

 

we are subject to increases in the price of raw materials labor manufacturing distribution and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products and we may not be able to fully offset this input cost inflation on a timely basis or at all 

 

many of the components of our cost of goods sold are subject to price increases that are attributable to factors beyond our control including but not limited to global economic conditions trade barriers or restrictions supply chain disruptions changes in crop size product scarcity demand dynamics currency rates water supply weather conditions import and export requirements and other factors the cost of raw materials labor manufacturing energy fuel packaging materials and other inputs related to the production and distribution of our products have increased and may continue to increase unexpectedly

 

 

in the latter part of fiscal 2021 and throughout fiscal 2022 input costs increased materially and at a rapid rate we expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into fiscal 2023

 

the company uses a variety of strategies to seek to offset this input cost inflation however we may not be able to generate sufficient productivity improvements price increases or commodity hedging benefits to fully offset these costs or do so on an acceptable timeline to the extent we are unable to offset present and future input cost increases our operating results could be materially and adversely affected

 

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry steel aluminum and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by global economic conditions trade barriers or restrictions supply chain disruptions commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations in addition recent world events have increased the risks posed by international trade disputes tariffs and sanctions we procure a wide spectrum of commodities globally and could potentially face increased prices for commodities sourced from nations that could be impacted by trade disputes tariffs or sanctions commodity price increases have resulted and may in the future result in increases in raw material packaging and energy costs and operating costs we have implemented pricing actions that have in part offset these increased costs but we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume reduced margins and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend

 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains wheat corn and oats oils beef pork poultry and energy changes in the values of these derivatives are generally recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments

 

strategic transaction risks 

 

we may not realize the benefits that we anticipated from the pinnacle foods acquisition 

 

the benefits that are expected to result from the pinnacle acquisition will continue to depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as the result of the acquisition our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of pinnacle

 

in fiscal 2019 we announced a restructuring and integration plan related to the ongoing integration of pinnacle for the purpose of achieving significant cost synergies the pinnacle integration restructuring plan we expect to continue incurring material charges over a multiyear period for exit and disposal activities under us generally accepted accounting principles we recognized charges of 196 million 317 million and 738 million in connection with the pinnacle integration restructuring plan in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively

 

 

the successful implementation of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan has presented significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges in many cases it has required successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition implementation of aspects of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan going forward may not advance our business strategy as expected to date we have generally been successful in implementing the pinnacle integration restructuring plan without material interruption of momentum in our activities events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings and cost synergies of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan or successfully and costeffectively implement aspects of the integration of pinnacle going forward our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the pinnacle integration restructuring plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

if we are unable to complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our profitability

 

our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers any of these factors could affect our sales financial condition and results of operations

 

if we are unable to complete certain divestitures our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

 

from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability and margins moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability

 

our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems possible need for providing transition services to buyers adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

 

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities or incur operational difficulties as a result of our spinoff of the lamb weston business 

 

on november 9 2016 we completed the spinoff of lamb weston holdings inc lamb weston through a distribution of 100 of our interest in lamb weston to holders of outstanding shares of our common stock the spinoff the spinoff involved a number of risks including among other things certain indemnification risks in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a trademark license agreement which we refer to as the lamb weston agreements the lamb weston agreements govern the spinoff and the postspinoff relationship between the two companies

 

 

the lamb weston agreements provide for indemnification obligations designed to make lamb weston financially responsible for certain liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution including any pending or future litigation it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and lamb weston and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to lamb weston third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification we may have to bear costs temporarily in addition our indemnity obligations to lamb weston may be significant these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations the lamb weston agreements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations if lamb weston is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur losses

 

operating risks 

 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image

 

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration and other federal state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

 

any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities the failure to achieve any stated goals with respect to the nutritional profile of our products our research and development efforts or our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management moreover the growing use of social and digital media by consumers has greatly increased the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

 

 

due to the seasonality of the business our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter 

 

our sales and cash flows are affected by seasonal cyclicality sales of frozen foods including frozen vegetables and frozen complete bagged meals tend to be marginally higher during the winter months seafood sales peak during lent in advance of the easter holiday since many of the raw materials we process are agricultural crops production of these products is predominantly seasonal occurring during and immediately following the purchase of such crops for these reasons sequential quarterly comparisons are not a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future if we are unable to obtain access to working capital or if seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 

customer risks 

 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment

 

trends indicate that people have continued to generally cook at home more often even as the covid19 pandemic subsides and our consumers are repurchasing our products across a number of our leading brands at higher rates if our products fail to meet changing consumer preferences or habits or if we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes

 

additionally as we have continued to implement pricing action in response to increased costs of goods sold the elasticity impact from our pricing actions has been favorable to date compared to historical trends but demand for our products could be affected if elasticities become unfavorable in response to our pricing actions

 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us 

 

during fiscal 2022 our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 27 of our consolidated net sales there can be no assurance that walmart inc and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

 

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have continued to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business these consolidations the growth of supercenters and the growth of ecommerce customers have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and who can demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their store brand products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label or store brand competition our profitability could decline

 

consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases

 

 

thirdparty partner risks 

 

disruption of our supply chain have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success during fiscal 2022 we have experienced disruption to our supply and elevated supply chain operating costs due in part to disruptions in the availability of labor and certain materials and input cost inflation continued or future damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic strikes government action geopolitical turmoil or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

 

in particular we continue to monitor the covid19 pandemic and its potential impact on our supply chain and our consolidated results of operations although our products are manufactured in north america and we source the significant majority of our ingredients and raw materials from north america due to restrictions resulting from the covid19 pandemic global supply has at time been and may continue to be constrained which has caused and may continue to cause the price of certain ingredients and raw materials used in our products to increase andor we may experience disruptions to our operations

 

additionally although we are a north american company with no operations in our direct exposure to russia and ukraine we have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation energy and raw material due in part to the negative impact of the russiaukraine military conflict on the global economy to date the conflict between russia and ukraine has not had a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations but continued geopolitical turmoil including expansion of the russiaukraine conflict into other countries or conflicts in other parts of the world may negatively impact our supply chain and our ability to manufacture or sell our products

 

the termination or expiration of current comanufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations 

 

our businesses periodically enter into comanufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products the terms of these agreements vary although many agreements are for a relatively short period of time some of the comanufacturing agreements are for extended periods volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the products life cycle product promotions alternative production capacity and other factors none of which are under our direct control our future ability to enter into comanufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed and a decrease in current comanufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume

 

as we outsource certain functions we become more dependent on the third parties performing those functions 

 

as part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies we have entered into agreements with thirdparty service providers under which we have outsourced certain information systems sales finance accounting and other functions and we may enter into managed services agreements with respect to other functions in the future if any of these thirdparty service providers do not perform according to the terms of the agreements or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers and our reputation could be harmed depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business interruption damage or disruption of information technology systems processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property or nonpublic company sensitive information effects on financial reporting litigation or remediation costs or damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

if any of our thirdparty service providers experience a cyber breach or system failure their businesses could be negatively impacted and it may result in disruption to our endtoend supply chain or affect our ability to fulfill customer orders both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business if our thirdparty service providers do not respond or perform effectively in connection with a cyber breach or system failure our business may be impacted in addition if we transition functions to one or more new or among existing external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

 

 

our operations are dependent on a wide array of third parties 

 

the success of our endtoend supply chain relies on the continued performance of a wide array of third parties suppliers comanufacturers thirdparty outsourcers warehousing partners and transportation providers are among our critical partners although we take steps to qualify and audit third parties with whom we do business we cannot guarantee that all third parties will perform dependably or at all it is possible that events beyond our control such as operational failures labor issues cybersecurity events pandemics or other health issues such as covid19 or other issues could impact our unaffiliated third parties if our third parties fail to deliver on their commitments introduce unplanned risk to our operations eg through cyber activity or are unable to fulfill their obligations we could experience manufacturing challenges shipment delays increased costs or lost revenue

 

legal regulatory and environmental risks 

 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties in addition changes in such laws may lead to increased costs 

 

our business is subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations including food and drug laws environmental laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws data privacy laws and anticorruption laws among others in and outside of the united states our operations are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state local and foreign government agencies including but not limited to the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and the department of labor in particular the processing packaging transportation storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment are each subject to governmental regulation additionally we are subject to data privacy and security regulations tax and securities regulations accounting and reporting standards and other financial laws and regulations our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products in addition changes in applicable laws and regulations including changes in taxation requirements and new or increased tariffs on products imported from certain countries may lead to increased costs and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products and affect our net operating revenues

 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as wheat tomatoes and a wide array of vegetables adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials lower recoveries of usable raw materials increase the prices of our raw materials increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials or disrupt our production schedules

 

 

we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the climate risk mitigation measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products additionally while we continue to take important steps to strive toward mitigation of climate risk and impact on climate change transitioning our business to adapt to and comply with evolving policy legal and regulatory changes may impose substantial operational and compliance burdens as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations

 

from time to time we establish strategies and expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters our ability to achieve any such strategies or expectations is subject to numerous factors and conditions many of which are outside of our control examples of such factors include but are not limited to evolving regulatory and other standards processes and assumptions the pace of scientific and technological developments increased costs and the availability of requisite financing market trends that may alter business opportunities the conduct of thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers constraint or disruptions our supply chain and changes in carbon markets failures or delays whether actual or perceived in achieving our strategies or expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters could adversely affect our business operations and reputation and increase risk of litigation

 

cybersecurity and information technology risks 

 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately 

 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes outside of our control such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures employee error or malfeasance security breaches computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing hacking and other cyberattacks while we have experienced threats to our data and systems to date we are not aware that we have experienced a material breach cyberattacks are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature and are becoming more sophisticated additionally continued geopolitical turmoil including the russiaukraine military conflict has heightened the risk of cyberattacks while we attempt to continuously monitor and mitigate against cyber risks including through leveraging multisourced threat intelligence investing in new technologies and developing thirdparty cybersecurity risk management capability in support of strategic suppliers we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents

 

sophisticated cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems including cloudbased platforms in addition new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyberattacks if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and associated automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results in addition there is a risk of business interruption violation of data privacy laws and regulations litigation and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business

 

additionally we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data including the european union general data protection regulation our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time

 

 

employee risks 

 

we rely on our management team and other key personnel 

 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals if key employees terminate their employment including by becoming ill as a result of the covid19 pandemic our business activities may be adversely affected our business activities may also be adversely affected if we are unable to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms

 

we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we do not successfully compete for the best talent our business activities may be adversely affected

 

a number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs including high employment levels federal unemployment subsidies including unemployment benefits offered in response to the covid19 pandemic and other government regulations unemployment programs and volatility in general macroeconomic factors impacting the labor market although we have not experienced any material labor shortage to date we have recently observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base or within the employee base of key suppliers or thirdparty manufacturers could negatively affect our supply chain or our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business

 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

 

our labor costs include wages and the cost of providing employee benefits including pension health and welfare and severance benefits the annual cost of providing these benefits varies as a result of factors such as the availability of skilled labor the costs of health care and the outcome of collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements in addition changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our wage and benefit costs pension obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations

 

goodwill or other intangible assets risks 

 

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

 

as of may 29 2022 we had goodwill of 1133 billion and other intangibles of 385 billion the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as the inability to quickly replace lost comanufacturing business increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer any impairment to goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively impact our net worth

 

 

intellectual property risks 

 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our intellectual property rights including our trademarks licensing agreements trade secrets patents and copyrights are a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws as well as entering into licensing thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property if we fail to adequately protect the intellectual property rights we have now or may acquire in the future or if there occurs any change in law or otherwise that serves to reduce or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected

 

certain of our intellectual property rights including the pf changs ®  bertolli ®  and libbys ® trademarks are owned by third parties and licensed to us and others such as alexia ®  are owned by us and licensed to third parties while many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to their terms if in the future we are unable to renew such a licensing arrangement pursuant to its terms and conditions or if we fail to renegotiate such a licensing arrangement then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected

 

there is also a risk that other parties may have intellectual property rights covering some of our brands products or technology if any third parties bring a claim of intellectual property infringement against us we may be subject to costly and timeconsuming litigation diverting the attention of management and our employees if we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims we may be subject to among other things significant damages injunctions against development and sale of certain products or we may be required to enter into costly licensing agreements any of which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

fiscal 2022 results 

 

fiscal 2022 performance compared to fiscal 2021 reflected an increase in net sales with organic excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and divested businesses increases in all of our operating segments overall gross profit decreased primarily as a result of input cost inflation higher transportation costs elevated supply chain operating costs due in part to disruptions in the availability of labor and certain materials and lost profits from divested businesses which were partially offset by higher organic net sales supply chain realized productivity cost synergies associated with the pinnacle acquisition and lower covid19 pandemicrelated expenses overall segment operating profit decreased in all of our operating segments corporate expenses were lower primarily due to items impacting comparability as discussed below in addition to lower sharebased payment and deferred compensation expense selling general and administrative sga expenses were higher primarily due to items impacting comparability partially offset by lower advertising and promotional expenses we recognized higher equity method investment earnings lower interest expense higher income tax expense in each case compared to fiscal 2021 excluding items impacting comparability our effective tax rate was slightly higher compared to fiscal 2021

during fiscal 2022 we experienced higher than expected input cost inflation including higher transportation and supply chain costs that negatively impacted gross margins we expect input cost inflation to persist in fiscal 2023 supply chain realized productivity and pricing actions will mitigate some of the inflationary pressures and are expected to improve margins more heavily in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023 as our estimates of inflation for fiscal 2023 continue to change it is impractical to quantify the impact at this time

 

although we are a north american focused company with no operations in or direct exposure to russia and ukraine we have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation energy and raw materials due in part to the negative impact of the russiaukraine military conflict on the global economy to date the conflict between russia and ukraine has not had a material impact on our business financial condition or result of operations

we continue to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our business throughout fiscal 2022 we continued to experience elevated demand for our products in the retail segments versus prepandemic levels but volumes were lower compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to the elasticity impact from inflationdriven pricing actions we experienced higher demand for our foodservice products across all of our major markets during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 as consumer traffic in awayfromhome food outlets continue to recover from the impacts of the pandemic we incurred 698 million of supply chain costs associated with the covid19 pandemic during fiscal 2022 which was a decrease in comparison to fiscal 2021

 

as we continue into fiscal 2023 we generally expect retail demand levels to remain elevated versus prepandemic levels and we continue to expect foodservice demand levels to return to more historical norms however uncertainty remains with the pandemic and such trends ultimately depend on the length and severity of the pandemic inclusive of the introduction of new strains and variants of the virus infection rates in the markets where we do business the federal state and local government actions taken in response vaccine effectiveness and the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2023 we continue to expect to see inflationary headwinds but anticipate that gross margins will begin to benefit from sales price increases and other cost savings measures we also continue to expect a decrease in costs related to the covid19 pandemic and a decrease in supply chain costs as we focus on realized productivity initiatives we will continue to evaluate the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our business consolidated results of operations and financial condition

 

we have experienced some challenges in connection with the covid19 pandemic including with respect to the supply of our ingredients packaging or other sourced materials despite these challenges all of our production facilities remain open we cannot predict the ultimate covid19 impact on our suppliers distributors and manufacturers

presentation of derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results 

 

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings in the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately see note 19 business segments and related information  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further discussion

segment operating profit earnings before general corporate expenses pension and postretirement nonservice income interest expense net income taxes and equity method investment earnings 

 

  

 

operating profit in our grocery  snacks segment for fiscal 2022 reflected a decrease in gross profits of 940 million compared to fiscal 2021 the lower gross profit was driven by the impacts of input cost inflation higher inventory writeoffs unfavorable fixed cost leverage elevated supply chain operating costs due in part to disruptions in the availability of labor and certain materials and a reduction in profit associated with the divestitures of our hk anderson ® and peter pan ® peanut butter businesses partially offset by the benefits of supply chain realized productivity cost synergies associated with the pinnacle acquisition and a decrease in covid19 pandemicrelated costs pandemicrelated costs included investments in employee safety protocols bonuses paid to supply chain employees and costs necessary to meet elevated levels of demand operating profit of the grocery  snacks segment was impacted by charges of 94 million and 278 million related to our restructuring plans in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively fiscal 2022 and 2021 included certain brand intangible impairment charges of 907 million and 130 million respectively fiscal 2022 included charges of 263 million related to the impairment of businesses held for sale fiscal 2021 included gains totaling 551 million related to the divestitures of certain businesses advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal 2022 decreased by 60 million compared to fiscal 2021

 

operating profit in our refrigerated  frozen segment for fiscal 2022 reflected a decrease in gross profits of 2315 million compared to fiscal 2021 due the impacts of input cost inflation unfavorable fixed cost leverage elevated supply chain operating costs due in part to disruptions in the availability of labor and certain materials higher inventory writeoffs and a reduction in profit associated with the divestiture of our egg beaters ® business partially offset by the benefits of supply chain realized productivity cost synergies associated with the pinnacle acquisition and a decrease in covid19 pandemicrelated costs operating profit of the refrigerated  frozen segment was impacted by charges of 1039 million and 769 million related to the impairment of certain brand intangible assets during fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively fiscal 2022 and 2021 included 145 million and 268 million respectively of charges related to our restructuring plans operating profit of the refrigerated  frozen segment included 289 million of charges related to the impairment of businesses held for sale and charges of 28 million associated with a fire occurring at one of our manufacturing facilities in fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 also included a gain of 104 million related to the divestiture of our egg beaters ® business reduced by a loss of 71 million related to the early exit of an unfavorable contract associated with the divestiture advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal 2022 decreased by 81 million compared to fiscal 2021

 

operating profit in our international segment for fiscal 2022 reflected flat gross profits compared to fiscal 2021 reflecting the net sales growth discussed above and the benefits of supply chain realized productivity partially offset by the impacts of input cost inflation operating profit of the international segment was impacted by charges of 144 million and 10 million related to the impairment of certain brand intangible assets during fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively

 

operating profit in our foodservice segment for fiscal 2022 reflected a decrease in gross profits of 30 million compared to fiscal 2021 driven by input cost inflation elevated supply chain operating costs due in part to disruptions in the availability of labor and certain materials and higher inventory writeoffs which more than offset the net sales growth discussed above and the benefits of supply chain realized productivity fiscal 2022 included charges of 149 million related to the impairment of businesses held for sale and charges of 76 million associated with a fire occurring at one of our manufacturing facilities

 

pension and postretirement nonservice income 

 

in fiscal 2022 pension and postretirement nonservice income was 673 million an increase of 128 million compared to fiscal 2021 fiscal 2022 reflected lower interest costs and an increase in expected returns on plan assets

 

interest expense net 

 

in fiscal 2022 net interest expense was 3799 million a decrease of 405 million or 10 from fiscal 2021 the decrease was driven by a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt see note 3 longterm debt  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further discussion

 

income taxes 

 

our income tax expense was 2905 million and 1938 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings was approximately 25 and 13 for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively see note 13 pretax income and income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for a discussion on the change in effective tax rates

 

 

in fiscal 2021 we completed a restructuring of our ownership interest in the ardent mills joint venture a milling business ardent mills that utilized a portion of our capital loss carryforward prior to its expiration after the restructuring certain balance sheet adjustments on ardent mills may impact our effective tax rate in future periods also in fiscal 2021 we completed several other transactions related to retained assets in conjunction with the divestitures of the peter pan ® peanut butter and egg beaters ® businesses that we believe will utilize a portion of the remaining capital loss carryforward these transactions were subject to elections made in connection with filing our fiscal 2021 federal tax return these elections are still under review by the internal revenue service these elections may result in increases to the tax basis in those assets and if successful would result in tax benefits being realized in future periods

 

we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events to be approximately 24 

 

equity method investment earnings 

 

we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates our most significant affiliate is the ardent mills joint venture our share of earnings from our equity method investment earnings were 1453 million and 844 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively ardent mills earnings for fiscal 2022 reflected the joint venture’s effective management through the recent volatility in the wheat markets

 

earnings per share 

 

diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 184 and 266 respectively the decrease in diluted earnings per share reflected lower net income see items impacting comparability above as several significant items affected the comparability of yearoveryear results of operations

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

sources of liquidity and capital 

 

the primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives we use a combination of equity and short and longterm debt we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories less accounts payable accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities we are committed to maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings

 

management believes that existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities our commercial paper program and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our debt obligations including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt working capital needs planned capital expenditures other contractual obligations and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months

 

borrowing facilities and longterm debt 

 

at may 29 2022 we had a revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of 16 billion subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 21 billion with the consent of the lenders the revolving credit facility matures on july 11 2024 and is unsecured the term of the revolving credit facility may be extended for additional oneyear or twoyear periods from the thenapplicable maturity date on an annual basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility which modified the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda financial covenant to require a ratio of not greater than 45 to 10 on a rolling fourquarter basis we have historically used a credit facility principally as a backup for our commercial paper program as of may 29 2022 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility

 

we had 1800 million outstanding under our commercial paper program as of may 29 2022 and 7057 million outstanding as of may 30 2021 the highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2022 was 9890 million 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 0500 senior notes due august 11 2023 the proceeds were primarily used to refinance commercial paper borrowings

 

 

additional information about our longterm debt balances as of may 29 2022 can be found in note 3 longterm debt  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report the weightedaverage coupon interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 29 2022 was approximately 44

 

we expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to retire or refinance longterm debt at maturity or otherwise from operating cash flows our commercial paper program access to the capital markets and our revolving credit facility we continuously evaluate opportunities to refinance our debt however any refinancing is subject to market conditions and other factors including financing options that may be available to us from time to time and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully refinance any debt on commercially acceptable terms at all

 

as of the end of fiscal 2022 our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult or impossible

 

our most restrictive debt agreement the revolving credit facility generally requires our ratio of ebitda to interest expense not be less than 30 to 10 and our ratio of funded debt to ebitda not to exceed 45 to 10 each ratio is to be calculated on a rolling fourquarter basis as of may 29 2022 we were in compliance with all financial covenants

 

equity and dividends 

 

we repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board under the share repurchase authorization we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years depending on market conditions and other factors and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date during fiscal 2022 we repurchased 15 million shares of our common stock under this authorization for an aggregate of 500 million the company’s total remaining share repurchase authorization as of may 29 2022 was 107 billion

 

on april 14 2022 we announced that our board had authorized a quarterly dividend payment of 03125 per share which was paid on june 1 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on april 29 2022 subsequent to our fiscal year end on july 21 2022 our board approved a 56 increase to our annualized dividend rate the board also approved a quarterly dividend of 033 per share to be paid on september 1 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on august 3 2022

 

contractual obligations 

 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments these obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs in addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding longterm debt and notes payable balances discussed above our contractual obligations primarily consist of lease payments income taxes pension and postretirement benefits and unconditional purchase obligations

 

a summary of our operating and finance lease obligations as of may 29 2022 can be found in note 14 leases  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report

 

the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions was 629 million as of may 29 2022 see note 13 pretax income and income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for information related to income taxes

 

as of may 29 2022 we had an aggregate funded pension asset of 1621 million and an aggregate unfunded postretirement benefit obligation totaling 614 million we expect to make payments totaling approximately 124 million and 81 million in fiscal 2023 to fund our pension and postretirement plans respectively see note 17 pension and postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements and critical accounting estimates – employeerelated benefits contained in this report for further discussion of our pension obligation and factors that could affect estimates of these obligations

 

 

as of may 29 2022 our unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as takeorpay contracts totaled approximately 263 billion approximately 191 billion of this balance is due in fiscal 2023 included in this amount are open purchase orders and other supply agreements totaling approximately 170 billion which are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year some are not legally binding andor may be cancellable warehousing service agreements totaling approximately 375 million make up a majority of our remaining unconditional purchase obligations with various terms of up to 10 years 

 

capital expenditures 

 

we continue to make investments in our business and operating facilities our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 is approximately 500 million

 

supplier arrangements 

 

we offer certain suppliers access to a thirdparty service that allows them to view our scheduled payments online the thirdparty service also allows suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party we have no economic interest in these financing arrangements and no direct relationship with the suppliers the third party or any financial institutions concerning this service all balances remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements and are reflected in accounts payable within our consolidated balance sheets the associated payments are included in net cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows as of may 29 2022 and may 30 2021 3783 million and 2793 million respectively of our total accounts payable was payable to suppliers who utilize this thirdparty service

 

the program commenced at about the same time that we began an initiative to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers although difficult to predict we generally expect the incremental cash flow benefits associated with these extended payment terms to increase at a slower rate in the future a number of factors may impact our future payment terms including our relative creditworthiness overall market liquidity and changes in interest rates and other general economic conditions

 

cash flows 

 

in fiscal 2022 we generated 31 million of cash which was the net result of 118 billion generated from operating activities 4349 million used in investing activities 7380 million used in financing activities and a decrease of 13 million due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

 

cash generated from operating activities totaled 118 billion in fiscal 2022 as compared to 147 billion generated in fiscal 2021 the decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by lower gross profits which reflect the impact of realized input cost inflation and higher transportation costs this was partially offset by decreased interest and pension contribution payments and increased equity method investment distributions received in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 operating cash flows in fiscal 2021 also benefited from the deferral of 339 million of employer payroll taxes under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act payments totaling 50 of such amounts were made in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and remaining payments will occur in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 changes in working capital were negatively impacted by increased accounts receivables resulting from inflationdriven pricing actions offset by a smaller degree of inventory build relative to prior year

 

cash used in investing activities totaled 4349 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 3403 million in fiscal 2021 net cash outflows from investing activities in fiscal 2022 and 2021 consisted primarily of capital expenditures totaling 4644 million and 5064 million respectively investing cash flows for fiscal 2021 also included proceeds totaling 1609 million from the sale of our egg beaters ®  peter pan ® peanut butter and hk anderson ® businesses 

 

cash used in financing activities totaled 7380 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 161 billion in fiscal 2021 financing activities in fiscal 2022 principally reflect net proceeds of 4991 million from the issuance of 5000 million aggregate principal amount of longterm debt net shortterm borrowing repayments of 5231 million cash dividends paid of 5818 million and common stock repurchases of 500 million financing activities in fiscal 2021 reflect repayments of longterm debt of 251 billion the issuance of longterm debt totaling 9882 million net shortterm borrowings of 7063 million cash dividends paid of 4746 million and common stock repurchases of 2981 million

 

 

cash held by international subsidiaries 

 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of 833 million at may 29 2022 and 792 million at may 30 2021 of which 747 million at may 29 2022 and 724 million at may 30 2021 was held in foreign countries a deferred tax liability is provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings in fiscal 2022 that are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested or cannot be remitted in a taxneutral transaction other undistributed foreign earnings are invested indefinitely and therefore we have not provided deferred taxes on those earnings

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management

 

our auditfinance committee has reviewed managements development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates

 

marketing costs —we offer various forms of trade promotions which are mostly recorded as a reduction in revenue the methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to provisions based on actual occurrence or performance our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and included activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period

 

we have recognized trade promotion liabilities of 1259 million as of may 29 2022 changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows

 

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our consolidated balance sheets as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established

 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 13 pretax income and income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report

 

 

employeerelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with our pension plans in order to measure the annual expense associated with these pension benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses employee turnover rates and anticipated mortality rates the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these pension benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time

 

the company uses a split discount rate the spotrate approach for the us plans and certain foreign plans the spotrate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost

 

we have recognized a pension liability of 1149 million and 1354 million as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively we also have recognized a pension asset of 2770 million and 2450 million as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status

 

we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation the corridor in current period expense annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when measurement is required otherwise under us gaap

 

we recognized pension expense benefit from company plans of 544 million 383 million and 59 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively such amounts reflect the yearend writeoff of actuarial losses gains in excess of 10 of our pension liability of 29 million 08 million and 448 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of 1454 million 1400 million and 1702 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively we contributed 115 million 276 million and 175 million to the pension plans of our continuing operations in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 124 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2023

 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate we use a spotrate approach discussed above this approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a highquality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate approach

 

based on this information the weightedaverage discount rate selected by us for determination of the interest cost component of our pension expense was 229 for fiscal 2022  230 for fiscal 2021  and 351 for fiscal 2020 the weightedaverage discount rate selected by us for determination of the service cost component of our pension expense was 350 for fiscal 2022 335 for fiscal 2021 and 404 for fiscal 2020 we selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 474 and 409 for determination of service and interest expense respectively for fiscal 2023 a 25basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2022 would increase our annual pension expense for our pension plans in fiscal 2022 by 36 million a 25basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2022 would decrease our annual pension expense for our pension plans in fiscal 2022 by 36 million f or our yearend pension obligation determination we selected discount rates of 448 and 304 for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively

 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plans investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 387 for the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2022 pension expense a 25basis point increasedecrease in our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2022 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans b y 94 million we selected a weightedaverage expected rate of return on p lan assets of 456 to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2023 a 25basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2022 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by 80 million 

 

 

business combinations impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets and goodwill —we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions

 

we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable we generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group for property plant and equipment if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group no impairment is recognized if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group we writedown the asset or assets to their estimated fair values the estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group

 

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands while other acquired intangible assets eg customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of definitelived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience the competitive and macroeconomic environment and our operating plans the costs of definitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life

 

we reduce the carrying amounts of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets

 

in assessing indefinitelived intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

 

if we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks we utilize a relief from royalty methodology the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital

 

 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill

 

in testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test

 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above furthermore management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit

 

under the quantitative impairment test the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a riskadjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period typically five years and the terminal period considering expected long term growth rates and trends estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in riskadjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit

 

as of may 29 2022 we have goodwill of 1133 billion indefinitelived intangibles of 306 billion and definitelived intangibles of 7915 million historically we have experienced impairments in brand intangibles and goodwill as a result of declining sales and other economic conditions for instance in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 we recorded total intangibles impairments of 2090 million 909 million and 1655 million respectively primarily related to our recently acquired pinnacle brands

 

with the addition of pinnacle intangibles that were recorded at fair value in fiscal 2019 we continue to be more susceptible to impairment charges in the future if our longterm sales forecasts royalty rates and other assumptions change as a result of lower than expected performance or other economic conditions we will monitor these assumptions as management continues to achieve gross margin improvement and longterm sales growth on certain key brands acquired in the acquisition including but not limited to birds eye ®  duncan hines ®  gardein ® and vlasic ® 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 on june 27 2022 management reorganized its internal reporting structure for certain brands within two reporting units in our refrigerated  frozen segment this change in management reporting requires us to reassign goodwill between the two reporting units and complete a goodwill impairment test both prior to and subsequent to the change as outlined in note 7 goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statement contained in this report our sides components enhancers reporting unit had approximately 20 excess fair value over carrying value as of our most recent annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 a significant input in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is the discount rate we used a discount rate for our sides components enhancers reporting unit of 650 in our most recent goodwill impairment test a 100basis point increase in our discount rate would result in less than 2 excess of fair value over carrying value in this reporting unit with all other assumptions unchanged from our most recent quantitative impairment test

 

 

assumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment therefore they are subject to change based upon the facts and circumstances present at each impairment test date we have not completed our goodwill impairment assessment necessitated by the change in internal reporting structure but we believe it is likely that we will incur a material impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as a result of current economic conditions including a significant increase in interest rates since our last quantitative goodwill impairment test any implied goodwill impairment would also trigger a reassessment of fair value for our indefinitelived intangibles that are within the respective reporting unit and may also result in a material impairment charge




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies

 

commodity market risk 

 

we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products nuts sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions

 

interest rate risk 

 

we may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt

 

as of may 29 2022 and may 30 2021 the fair value of our longterm debt including current installments was estimated at 885 billion and 976 billion respectively based on current market rates as of may 29 2022 and may 30 2021 a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 4818 million and 6822 million respectively while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 5434 million and 7798 million respectively

 

foreign currency risk 

 

in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities

 

effect of hypothetical 10 fluctuation 

 

we changed the disclosure alternative for reporting our commodity and foreign exchange derivatives inclusive of commodity and foreign exchange swaps futures forwards and options in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 from a valueatrisk var model to a hypothetical sensitivity analysis the change in the methodology was made to simplify and enhance the information presented about the sensitivities of our derivative positions

 

the potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity and foreign exchange contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates would have been in millions 

 

  

 

it should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items in relation to foreign currency contracts this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar

general

the following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments

conagra brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded private branded and valueadded consumer food as well as foodservice items and ingredients we use many different raw materials most of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources from time to time we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and the use of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption

we experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets our food items compete with widely advertised wellknown branded food as well as private branded and customized food items some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty

demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events for example sales of frozen foods tend to be marginally higher during the winter months seafood sales are highest during lent in advance of the easter holiday and production of certain of our products occurs seasonally during or immediately following the purchase of agricultural crops

 

we manufacture primarily for stock  we fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

our intellectual property rights including our trademarks licensing agreements trade secrets patents and copyrights are of material importance to our business and we attempt to protect such rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws as well as entering into licensing thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others including under the pf chang’s ®  bertolli ®  and libby’s ® trademarks we also own certain intellectual property rights that are licensed to third parties such as the alexia ® trademark while many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to their terms we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state local and foreign government agencies including but not limited to the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and the department of labor in particular the processing packaging transportation storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment are each subject to governmental regulation additionally we are subject to data privacy and security regulations tax and securities regulations accounting and reporting standards and other financial laws and regulations we believe that we are in compliance with such laws and regulations in all material respects and do not expect that continued compliance with such regulations will have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position

safety and health the health and safety of our employees is our top priority we are focused on maintaining a strong culture of safety in which all employees commit to protecting themselves and their colleagues during fiscal year 2021 our occupational safety  health administration incident rate was 200 incidents per 100 fulltime workers as compared to 169 incidents per 100 fulltime workers in fiscal 2020 and 228 incidents per 100 fulltime workers in fiscal 2019 we compare our incident rate to that of the average for companies in the food manufacturing sector as published by the bureau of labor statistics 

 

in each of the last three fiscal years our incident rate has been below the industry average our health and safety team audits each of our facilities every two years to ensure compliance with safety regulations and corporate policies the team documents the audit results and tracks corrective actions to ensure we hold ourselves accountable for providing a safe work environment 

beginning in february 2020 and over the course of the covid19 pandemic our senior leadership has relied on crossfunctional teams a covid19 pandemic team return to office team and vaccine preparedness team to review and assess the evolving situation and to recommend risk mitigation actions for the health and safety of our employees in order to enhance the safety of our employees during the covid19 pandemic these teams have recommended and we have implemented various measures including the installation of physical barriers between employees employee screening protocols facility cleaning and sanitation protocols policies on the use of personal protective equipment and robust employee leave policies we have also executed a phased return to office approach to enable inperson work for corporate personnel implemented workfromhome initiatives for certain office personnel and provided increased access to covid19 vaccines for production facilities and corporate locations

during fiscal 2021 we launched numerous efforts to amplify our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce













we also continue to provide diversity and inclusion training for employees to highlight issues that impact underrepresented communities and to reduce the effects of bias in the workplace our goal is to create a culture of belonging where everyone can experience inclusion we want to be a place where people trust and respect one another while we value and embrace diversity we also celebrate what we all have in common—our energy and passion for making great food and great brands

 item 1a risk factors

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is described separately many of the risks are interrelated while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future

covid19 pandemic risks

the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

although we have experienced challenges in connection with the covid19 pandemic including temporary closings of production facilities employee illnesses increased costs supply chain interruptions and reduced demand in our foodservice segment the pandemic has not todate had a net negative impact on our liquidity or results of operations however the continued spread of covid19 could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways in the future these impacts could include but are not limited to













the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus the emergence and spread of variants infection rates in areas where we operate the extent and effectiveness of containment actions including the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines in the markets where we operate and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers suppliers distributors and manufacturers should these conditions persist for a prolonged period the covid19 pandemic including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this item 1a risk factors  any of which could have a material effect on us 

 

market risks 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations

our business and results of operations have in the past been and may continue to be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges the negative impacts caused by pandemics and public health crises including the covid19 pandemic and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions has impacted and could continue to impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows











credit risks

our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations or returning cash to stockholders

as of may 30 2021 we had total debt of approximately 901 billion including approximately 821 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs make planned capital expenditures and return cash to stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate that our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs make planned capital expenditures or return cash to stockholders

our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could

















 

 





additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings in the event of a default the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt

recently we have increasingly accessed the commercial paper markets for ongoing funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper additionally disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit markets could also reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us

competition risks

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits

the food industry is highly competitive and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases we sell branded private brand and customized food products as well as commercially branded foods our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors in addition when branded competitors focus on price and promotion the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume

in addition substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry the expanding presence of ecommerce retailers has impacted and may continue to impact consumer preferences and market dynamics which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to 

 

implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

commodity risks

we are subject to increases in the price of raw materials labor manufacturing distribution and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products and we may not be able to fully offset this input cost inflation on a timely basis or at all

many of the components of our cost of goods sold are subject to price increases that are attributable to factors beyond our control including but not limited to changes in crop size product scarcity demand dynamics currency rates water supply weather conditions import and export requirements and other factors the cost of raw materials labor manufacturing energy fuel packaging materials and other inputs related to the production and distribution of our products can also increase unexpectedly

in the latter part of fiscal 2021 and the early part of fiscal 2022 input costs have increased materially and at a rapid rate we expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into fiscal 2022

the company uses a variety of strategies to seek to offset this input cost inflation however we may not be able to generate sufficient productivity improvements price increases or commodity hedging benefits to fully offset these costs or do so on an acceptable timeline to the extent we are unable to offset present and future input cost increases our operating results could be materially and adversely affected

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry steel aluminum and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations in addition recent world events have increased the risks posed by international trade disputes tariffs and sanctions we procure a wide spectrum of commodities globally and could potentially face increased prices for commodities sourced from nations that could be impacted by trade disputes tariffs or sanctions commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material packaging and energy costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume reduced margins and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains wheat corn and oats oils beef pork poultry and energy changes in the values of these derivatives are generally recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments

strategic transaction risks

we may not realize the benefits that we anticipated from the pinnacle foods acquisition

the benefits that are expected to result from the pinnacle acquisition will continue to depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as the result of the acquisition our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of pinnacle 

 

in fiscal 2019 we announced a restructuring and integration plan related to the ongoing integration of pinnacle for the purpose of achieving significant cost synergies the pinnacle integration restructuring plan we expect to continue incur ring material charges over a multiyear period for exit and disposal activities under us generally accepted accounting principles we recognized charges of 317 million 738 million and 1682 million in connection with the pinnacle integration restructuring plan in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the successful implementation of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges in many cases it requires successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the pinnacle integration restructuring plan may not advance our business strategy as expected events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings and cost synergies of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the pinnacle integration restructuring plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in our activities members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage the company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer there can be no assurance that we will successfully or costeffectively integrate pinnacle the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

if we are unable to complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our profitability

our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers any of these factors could affect our sales financial condition and results of operations

if we are unable to complete certain divestitures our financial results could be materially and adversely affected

from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability and margins moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability

our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems possible need for providing transition services to buyers adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities or incur operational difficulties as a result of our spinoff of the lamb weston business the spinoff

the spinoff involves a number of risks including among other things certain indemnification risks in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services 

 

agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a trademark license agreement which we refer to as the lamb weston agreements the lamb weston agreements govern the spinoff and the relationship between the two companies going forward 

the lamb weston agreements provide for indemnification obligations designed to make lamb weston financially responsible for certain liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution including any pending or future litigation it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and lamb weston and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to lamb weston third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification we may have to bear costs temporarily in addition our indemnity obligations to lamb weston may be significant these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations the lamb weston agreements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations if lamb weston is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur losses 

operating risks

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration and other federal state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities the failure to achieve any stated goals with respect to the nutritional profile of our products our research and development efforts or our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management moreover the growing use of social and digital media by consumers has greatly increased the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

 

due to the seasonality of the business our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter 

our sales and cash flows are affected by seasonal cyclicality sales of frozen foods including frozen vegetables and frozen complete bagged meals tend to be marginally higher during the winter months seafood sales peak during lent in advance of the easter holiday since many of the raw materials we process are agricultural crops production of these products is predominantly seasonal occurring during and immediately following the purchase of such crops for these reasons sequential quarterly comparisons are not a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future if we are unable to obtain access to working capital or if seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

customer risks

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment 

trends indicate that people are generally cooking at home more often as a result of the covid19 pandemic and our consumers are repurchasing our products across a number of our leading brands at higher rates if our products fail to meet changing consumer preferences or habits or if we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us

during fiscal 2021 our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 26 of our consolidated net sales there can be no assurance that walmart inc and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have continued to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business these consolidations the growth of supercenters and the growth of ecommerce customers have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and who can demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their store brand products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label or store brand competition our profitability could decline

consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases

thirdparty partner risks

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic strikes 

 

government action or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

in particular we continue to monitor the covid19 pandemic and its potential impact on our supply chain and our consolidated results of operations although our products are manufactured in north america and we source the significant majority of our ingredients and raw materials from north america due to restrictions resulting from the covid19 pandemic global supply may become constrained which may cause the price of certain ingredients and raw materials used in our products to increase andor we may experience disruptions to our operations 

the termination or expiration of current comanufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations

our businesses periodically enter into comanufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products the terms of these agreements vary although many agreements are for a relatively short period of time some of the comanufacturing agreements are for extended periods volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the products life cycle product promotions alternative production capacity and other factors none of which are under our direct control our future ability to enter into comanufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed and a decrease in current comanufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume

as we outsource certain functions we become more dependent on the third parties performing those functions

as part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies we have entered into agreements with thirdparty service providers under which we have outsourced certain information systems sales finance accounting and other functions and we may enter into managed services agreements with respect to other functions in the future if any of these thirdparty service providers do not perform according to the terms of the agreements or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers and our reputation could be harmed depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business interruption damage or disruption of information technology systems processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property or nonpublic company sensitive information effects on financial reporting litigation or remediation costs or damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if any of our thirdparty service providers experience a cyber breach or system failure their businesses could be negatively impacted and it may result in disruption to our endtoend supply chain or affect our ability to fulfill customer orders both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business if our thirdparty service providers do not respond or perform effectively in connection with a cyber breach or system failure our business may be impacted in addition if we transition functions to one or more new or among existing external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

our operations are dependent on a wide array of third parties

the success of our endtoend supply chain relies on the continued performance of a wide array of third parties suppliers comanufacturers thirdparty outsourcers warehousing partners and transportation providers are among our critical partners although we take steps to qualify and audit third parties with whom we do business we cannot guarantee that all third parties will perform dependably or at all it is possible that events beyond our control such as operational failures labor issues cybersecurity events pandemics or other health issues such as covid19 or other issues could impact our unaffiliated third parties if our third parties fail to deliver on their commitments introduce unplanned risk to our operations eg through cyber activity or are unable to fulfill their obligations we could experience manufacturing challenges shipment delays increased costs or lost revenue

 

legal regulatory  and environmental risks 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties in addition changes in such laws may lead to increased costs

our business is subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations including food and drug laws environmental laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws data privacy laws and anticorruption laws among others in and outside of the united states our operations are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state local and foreign government agencies including but not limited to the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and the department of labor in particular the processing packaging transportation storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment are each subject to governmental regulation additionally we are subject to data privacy and security regulations tax and securities regulations accounting and reporting standards and other financial laws and regulations our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products in addition changes in applicable laws and regulations including changes in taxation requirements and new or increased tariffs on products imported from certain countries may lead to increased costs and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations

our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products and affect our net operating revenues

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as wheat tomatoes and a wide array of vegetables adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials lower recoveries of usable raw materials increase the prices of our raw materials increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials or disrupt our production schedules

we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations

cybersecurity and information technology risks

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes outside of our control such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures employee error or malfeasance security breaches computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks 

 

phishing hacking and other cyberattacks while we have experienced threats to our data and systems to date we are not aware that we have experienced a material breach cyberattacks are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature and are becoming more sophisticated we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents 

sophisticated cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems including cloudbased platforms in addition new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyberattacks if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and associated automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results in addition there is a risk of business interruption violation of data privacy laws and regulations litigation and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business

additionally we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data including the european union general data protection regulation our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time

employee risks

we rely on our management team and other key personnel

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals if key employees terminate their employment including by becoming ill as a result of the covid19 pandemic our business activities may be adversely affected our business activities may also be adversely affected if we are unable to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms

we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we do not successfully compete for the best talent our business activities may be adversely affected

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses

our labor costs include wages and the cost of providing employee benefits including pension health and welfare and severance benefits the annual cost of providing these benefits varies as a result of factors such as the availability of skilled labor the costs of health care and the outcome of collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements in addition changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our wage and benefit costs pension obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

goodwill or other intangible assets risks

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth

as of may 30 2021 we had goodwill of 1137 billion and other intangibles of 416 billion the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are 

 

not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as the inability to quickly replace lost comanufacturing business increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer  any impairment to goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively impact our net worth 

intellectual property risks

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our intellectual property rights including our trademarks licensing agreements trade secrets patents and copyrights are a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws as well as entering into licensing thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property if we fail to adequately protect the intellectual property rights we have now or may acquire in the future or if there occurs any change in law or otherwise that serves to reduce or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected

certain of our intellectual property rights including the pf changs ®  bertolli ®  and libbys ® trademarks are owned by third parties and licensed to us and others such as alexia ®  are owned by us and licensed to third parties while many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to their terms if in the future we are unable to renew such a licensing arrangement pursuant to its terms and conditions or if we fail to renegotiate such a licensing arrangement then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected

there is also a risk that other parties may have intellectual property rights covering some of our brands products or technology if any third parties bring a claim of intellectual property infringement against us we may be subject to costly and timeconsuming litigation diverting the attention of management and our employees if we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims we may be subject to among other things significant damages injunctions against development and sale of certain products or we may be required to enter into costly licensing agreements any of which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

fiscal 2021 results 

fiscal 2021 performance compared to fiscal 2020 reflected an increase in net sales with organic excludes the impacts of foreign exchange divested businesses as well as the impact of the 53 rd week on fiscal 2020 increases in all of our operating segments with the exception of our foodservice segment in each case compared to fiscal 2020 organic net sales for our retail segments inclusive of grocery  snacks refrigerated  frozen and international were positively impacted by the increase in athome food consumption as a result of the covid19 pandemic with sales declines in our foodservice segment due to lower traffic in awayfromhome food outlets 

overall gross margin increased due to increased net sales supply chain realized productivity cost synergies associated with the pinnacle acquisition favorable margin mix and fixed cost leverage these benefits were partially offset by higher input cost inflation higher transportation costs lost profits due to divested businesses covid19 related expenses and the exclusion of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2020 overall segment operating profit increased in all of our operating segments with the exception of our foodservice segment corporate expenses were relatively flat yearoveryear but included various items impacting comparability as discussed below we experienced an increase in equity method investment earnings a decrease in interest expense and a decrease in income tax expense in each case compared to fiscal 2020

diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 were 266 diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 were 172 diluted earnings per share were affected by higher net income as well as several significant items affecting the comparability of yearoveryear results of continuing operations see items impacting comparability below

in the fourth quarter fiscal 2021 we experienced higher than expected input cost inflation including higher transportation and supply chain costs that negatively impacted gross margins we expect input cost inflation to be materially higher in fiscal 2022 supply chain realized productivity and pricing actions will mitigate some of the inflationary pressures but we do not expect such benefits to occur in time to fully offset the incremental costs in fiscal 2022 as our estimates of inflation for fiscal 2022 continue to change it is impractical to quantify the impact at this time

divestitures

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we completed the sale of our egg beaters ® business for net proceeds of 506 million subject to final working capital adjustments the results of operations of the divested egg beaters ® business were primarily included in our refrigerated  frozen segment and to a lesser extent within our international and foodservice segments for the periods preceding the completion of the transaction 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 we completed the sale of our peter pan ® peanut butter business for net proceeds of 1015 million including working capital adjustments but subject to final adjustments for certain tax benefits the results of operations of the divested peter pan ® peanut butter business were primarily included in our grocery  snacks segment and to a lesser extent within our international and foodservice segments for the periods preceding the completion of the transaction 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we completed the sale of our lenders ® bagel business for net proceeds of 333 million including working capital adjustments the results of operations of the divested lender’s ® bagel business were primarily included in our refrigerated  frozen segment and to a lesser extent within our foodservice segment for the periods preceding the completion of the transaction

during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we completed the sale of our direct store delivery dsd snacks business for net proceeds of 1375 million including working capital adjustments the results of operations of the divested dsd snacks business were included in our grocery  snacks segment for the periods preceding the completion of the transaction 

restructuring plans

in december 2018 our board approved a restructuring and integration plan related to the ongoing integration of the operations of pinnacle which we acquired in october 2018 the pinnacle integration restructuring plan for the purpose of achieving significant cost synergies between the companies as a result of which we expect to incur material charges for exit and disposal activities under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap we expect to incur approximately 3580 million of charges 2835 million of cash charges and 745 million of noncash charges for actions identified to date under the pinnacle integration restructuring plan the board andor our senior management have authorized incurrence of these charges we recognized charges of 317 million 738 million and 1682 million in connection with the pinnacle integration restructuring plan in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect to incur costs related to the pinnacle integration restructuring plan over a multiyear period

in fiscal 2019 senior management initiated a restructuring plan the conagra restructuring plan for costs incurred in connection with actions taken to improve selling general and administrative sga expense effectiveness and efficiencies and to optimize our supply chain network although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire conagra restructuring plan we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of fiscal 2021 including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of cost expected to be incurred and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows as of may 30 2021 we had approved the incurrence of 1722 million 454 million of cash charges and 1268 million of non

 

cash charges for several projects associated with the conagra restructuring plan we have incurred or expect to incur  1 57 3 million of charges  369 million of cash charges and  1204 million of noncash charges for actions identified to date under the conagra restructuring plan w e recognized charges of  462 million   644 million  and 22 million in connection with the conagra restructuring plan in fiscal 202 1  2020 and 20 19  respectively we expect to incur costs related to the conagra restructuring plan over a multiyear period 

covid19 pandemic

we have continued to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our business throughout fiscal 2021 we experienced higher net sales for our products in both of our grocery  snacks and refrigerated  frozen segments until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as we began to lap the initial surge in demand at the beginning of the pandemic we have also experienced reduced demand for our foodservice products across all of our major markets as consumer traffic in awayfromhome food outlets decreased as a result of the covid19 pandemic however as states have reopened their economies during 2021 our foodservice net sales have improved compared to the initial months of the pandemic 

as we progress through fiscal 2022 we generally expect retail demand levels to remain elevated versus prepandemic levels and we expect foodservice demand levels to return to more historical norms however there still remains uncertainty with the pandemic and such trends ultimately depend on the length and severity of the pandemic inclusive of the introduction of new strains of the virus the federal state and local government actions taken in response continued vaccine availability and effectiveness and the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2022 we also expect to see inflationary headwinds but anticipate that they will be partially mitigated by supply chain realized productivity and price increases that began to be introduced at the end of fiscal 2021 we also expect a decrease in costs related to the covid19 pandemic and a decrease in supply chain costs as we continue to recover our supply and service levels we will continue to evaluate the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our business consolidated results of operations and financial condition

during fiscal 2021 our operating margins benefitted from fixed cost leverage reduced travel expenses and lower trade promotional activity on certain brands that benefit was partially offset by several factors including higher transportation and warehousing costs employee safety and sanitation costs and employee compensation costs which combined accounted for an estimated 143 million of additional incremental costs in fiscal 2021 similar incremental costs starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were estimated to be approximately 40 million while we expect these incremental costs to decrease in fiscal 2022 the timing and amount of such decrease is dependent upon the ultimate length and severity of the pandemic as outlined above

beginning in february 2020 and over the course of the covid19 pandemic we created covid19 pandemic return to office and vaccine preparedness teams in order to review and assess the evolving covid19 pandemic and to recommend risk mitigation actions for the health and safety of our employees in order to enhance the safety of our employees during the covid19 pandemic these teams have recommended and implemented various measures including the installation of physical barriers between employees in production facilities cleaning and sanitation protocols for both production and office spaces execution of a phased return to office approach to enable inperson work for corporate personnel implementation of workfromhome initiatives for certain office personnel and increased access to vaccines for production facilities and corporate locations the implementation of such safety measures has not resulted in any meaningful change to our financial control environment 

all of our production facilities remain open and there has been minimal disruption to our supply chain network to date including with respect to the supply of our ingredients packaging or other sourced materials however we cannot predict the ultimate covid19 impact on our suppliers distributors and manufacturers

segment review

presentation of derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings in the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately see note 20 business segments and related information  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further discussion

pension and postretirement nonservice income

in fiscal 2021 pension and postretirement nonservice income was 545 million an increase of 446 million compared to fiscal 2020 the increase was driven by a charge of 448 million in fiscal 2020 compared to a charge of 08 million in fiscal 2021 related to the yearend writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability the increase in losses outside of the 10 corridor in the prior year was driven by a reduction of the discount rate used to remeasure the pension obligations to present value and a reduction in asset values for certain plan assets 

interest expense net

in fiscal 2021 net interest expense was 4204 million a decrease of 667 million or 14 from fiscal 2020 the decrease was driven by an overall reduction of our debt balances see note 4 longterm debt  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further discussion

income taxes

our income tax expense was 1938 million and 2013 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings was approximately 13 and 19 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively see note 14 pretax income and income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for a discussion on the change in effective tax rates

in fiscal 2021 we completed a restructuring of our ownership interest in ardent mills that utilized a portion of our capital loss carryforward prior to its expiration also in fiscal 2021 we completed several other transactions related to retained assets in conjunction with the divestitures of the peter pan ® peanut butter and egg beaters ® businesses that we believe will utilize a portion of the remaining capital loss carryforward these transactions are subject to certain elections and are currently under review by the internal revenue service we believe they may result in increases to the tax basis in those assets and if successful would result in tax benefits being realized in future periods

we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events to be approximately 2324

equity method investment earnings

we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates our most significant affiliate is the ardent mills joint venture our share of earnings from our equity method investment earnings were 844 million and 732 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively results for fiscal 2020 included a gain of 41 million from the sale of assets by the ardent mills joint venture ardent mills earnings for fiscal 2021 reflected favorable market conditions

diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 and 2020 were 266 and 172 respectively the increase in diluted earnings per share reflected higher net income in addition see items impacting comparability above as several significant items affected the comparability of yearoveryear results of operations

liquidity and capital resources

sources of liquidity and capital

the primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives we use a combination of equity and short and longterm debt we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories less accounts payable accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities we are committed to maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings

management believes that existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities our commercial paper program and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our debt obligations including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt working capital needs planned capital expenditures and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months

borrowing facilities and longterm debt

at may 30 2021 we had a revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of 16 billion subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 21 billion with the consent of the lenders the revolving credit facility matures on july 11 2024 and is unsecured the term of the revolving credit facility may be extended for additional oneyear or twoyear periods from the thenapplicable maturity date on an annual basis we have historically used a credit facility principally as a backup for our commercial paper program as of may 30 2021 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

we had 7057 million outstanding under our commercial paper program as of may 30 2021 and no amounts outstanding as of may 31 2020 the highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2021 was 105 billion 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we repaid the remaining outstanding 1959 million aggregate principal amount of our 975 subordinated notes on their maturity date of march 1 2021 the repayment was primarily funded by the issuance of commercial paper 

a summary of our longterm debt balances as of may 30 2021 can be found in note 4 longterm debt  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report the weightedaverage coupon interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 30 2021 was approximately 46

we expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to retire or refinance longterm debt upon maturity from operating cash flows our commercial paper program access to the capital markets and our revolving credit facility we continuously evaluate opportunities to refinance our debt however any refinancing is subject to market conditions and other factors including financing options that may be available to us from time to time and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully refinance any debt on commercially acceptable terms at all 

as of the end of fiscal 2021 our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult or impossible

our most restrictive debt agreement the revolving credit facility generally requires our ratio of ebitda to interest expense not be less than 30 to 10 and our ratio of funded debt to ebitda not to exceed certain decreasing specified levels ranging from 475 through the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to 375 from the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and thereafter each ratio is to be calculated on a rolling fourquarter basis as of may 30 2021 we were in compliance with all financial covenants 

 

on july 13 2021 subsequent to our fiscal year end we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility  the amendment modifies the ra tio of funded debt to ebitda financial covenant to require a ratio of not greater than 450 on a rolling fourquarter basis 

equity and dividends

we repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board under the share repurchase authorization we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years depending on market conditions and other factors and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date during fiscal 2021 we repurchased 88 million shares of our common stock under this authorization for an aggregate of 2981 million the company’s total remaining share repurchase authorization as of may 30 2021 was 112 billion

on april 16 2021 we announced that our board had authorized a quarterly dividend payment of 0275 per share which was paid on june 2 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on april 30 2021 subsequent to our fiscal year end our board approved a 14 increase to our annualized dividend rate the board approved a quarterly dividend of 03125 per share to be paid on september 2 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on august 3 2021 

contractual obligations 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments these obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs in addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding longterm debt and notes payable balances discussed above our contractual obligations primarily consist of leases payments income taxes pension and postretirement benefits and unconditional purchase obligations 

a summary of our operating and finance lease obligations as of may 30 2021 can be found in note 15 leases  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions was 330 million as of may 30 2021 see note 14 pretax income and income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for information related to income taxes 

as of may 30 2021 we had an aggregate funded pension asset of 1096 million and an aggregate unfunded postretirement benefit obligation totaling 782 million we expect to make payments totaling approximately 123 million and 90 million in fiscal 2022 to fund our pension and postretirement plans respectively see note 18 pension and postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements and critical accounting estimates – employmentrelated benefits contained in this report for further discussion of our pension obligation and factors that could affect estimates of these obligations 

as of may 30 2021 our unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as takeorpay contracts totaled approximately 251 billion approximately 182 billion of this balance is due in fiscal 2022 included in this amount are open purchase orders and other supply agreements totaling approximately 153 billion which are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year some are not legally binding andor may be cancellable warehousing service agreements totaling approximately 400 million and obligations for leases that have not yet commenced totaling 2722 million as of may 30 2021 make up a majority of our remaining unconditional purchase obligations with various terms of up to 20 years 

capital expenditures

we continue to make investments in our business and operating facilities our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 is approximately 475 million

supplier arrangements

in fiscal 2017 we began a program to offer certain suppliers access to a thirdparty service that allows them to view our scheduled payments online the thirdparty service also allows suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party we have no economic interest in these financing arrangements and no direct 

 

relationship with the suppliers the third party or any financial institutions concerning this service all balances remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements and are reflected in a ccounts payable within our consolidated balance sheets the associated payments are included in net cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows  as of may 30 2021 and may 31 2020  2793 million and 2587 million respectively of our total accounts payable was payable to suppliers who utilize this thirdparty service 

the program commenced at about the same time that we began an initiative to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers although difficult to predict we generally expect the incremental cash flow benefits associated with these extended payment terms to increase at a slower rate in the future a number of factors may impact our future payment terms  including our relative creditworthiness overall market liquidity and changes in interest rates and other general economic conditions 

cash flows

in fiscal 2021 we used 4741 million of cash which was the net result of 147 billion generated from operating activities 3403 million used in investing activities 161 billion used in financing activities and an increase of 77 million due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

cash generated from operating activities totaled 147 billion in fiscal 2021 as compared to 184 billion generated in fiscal 2020 operating cash flows for fiscal 2021 reflected increased net sales in our retail segments from covid19 pandemicrelated demand as well as decreased interest payments this was partially offset by increased tax payments compared to fiscal 2020 tax payments for fiscal 2021 included approximately 470 million of fourth quarter fiscal 2020 tax payments which were deferred due to the extension of the deadline for certain federal cash tax payments comparative changes in working capital balances were most notably impacted by inventory rebuilding in fiscal 2021 as certain brands had previously been on allocation due to high demand through the pandemic further our inventory balances also have experienced recent input cost inflation which is giving rise to larger inventory amounts period over period operating cash flows benefited from the continued deferral of employer payroll taxes under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act which totaled 339 million for fiscal 2021 payment of such amounts will occur in fiscal 2022 and 2023 

cash used in investing activities totaled 3403 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 1538 million in fiscal 2020 investing activities in fiscal 2021 consisted primarily of capital expenditures totaling 5064 million partially offset by net proceeds totaling 1609 million from the sale of our egg beaters ®  peter pan ® peanut butter and hk anderson ® businesses investing activities in fiscal 2020 consisted mainly of capital expenditures of 3695 million and the net proceeds from divestitures totaling 1946 million including the sales of our dsd snacks and lenders ® bagel businesses 

cash used in financing activities totaled 161 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 137 billion in fiscal 2020 financing activities in fiscal 2021 principally reflect repayments of longterm debt of 251 billion the issuance of longterm debt totaling 9882 million net shortterm borrowings of 7063 million cash dividends paid of 4746 million and common stock repurchases of 2981 million financing activities in fiscal 2020 consisted principally of the repayment of longterm debt totaling 9475 million and cash dividends paid of 4136 million 

cash held by international subsidiaries

the company had cash and cash equivalents of 792 million at may 30 2021 and 5533 million at may 31 2020 of which 724 million at may 30 2021 and 805 million at may 31 2020 was held in foreign countries we believe that our foreign subsidiaries have invested or will invest any undistributed earnings indefinitely or that any undistributed earnings will be remitted in a taxneutral transaction and therefore do not provide deferred taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 

critical accounting estimates

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management

our auditfinance committee has reviewed managements development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates

 

marketing costs —we offer various forms of trade promotions which are mostly recorded as a reduction in revenue the methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to provisions based on actual occurrence or performance our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and included activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 

we have recognized trade promotion liabilities of 1468 million as of may 30 2021 changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our consolidated balance sheets as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 14 pretax income and income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup managements estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately 615 million for environmental liabilities as of may 30 2021 the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions and postretirement health care benefits in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates and anticipated health care costs the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 

 

t he company use s a split discount rate the spotrate approach for the us plans and certain foreign plans the spotrate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost 

we have recognized a pension liability of 1354 million and 2545 million and a postretirement liability of 812 million and 893 million as of the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively we also have recognized a pension asset of 2450 million and 2024 million as of the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status

we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation the corridor in current period expense annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when measurement is required otherwise under us gaap

we recognized pension expense benefit from company plans of 383 million 59 million and 227 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively such amounts reflect the yearend writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability of 08 million 448 million and 51 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of 1400 million 1702 million and 1744 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we contributed 276 million 175 million and 147 million to the pension plans of our continuing operations in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 123 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2022

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate we use a spotrate approach discussed above this approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a highquality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate approach

based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 298 for fiscal 2021 388 for fiscal 2020 and 415 for fiscal 2019 we selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 350 and 229 for determination of service and interest expense respectively for fiscal 2022 a 25basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2021 would increase our annual pension expense for our pension plans in fiscal 2022 by 52 million a 25basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2021 would decrease our annual pension expense for our pension plans in fiscal 2022 by 57 million for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected discount rates of 304 and 298 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plans investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 374 for the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2021 pension expense a 25basis point increasedecrease in our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2021 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by 93 million we selected a weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets of 387 to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2022 a 25basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2022 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by 94 million

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit income of 44 million 42 million and 13 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 90 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2022

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates also discussed above and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 239 for fiscal 2021 348 for fiscal 2020 and 381 for fiscal 2019 we have selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 251 for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2022 a 25basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 653 with the trend rate decreasing to 444 by 2029

 

business combinations impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets and goodwill —we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets including property plant and equipment to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable we generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group no impairment is recognized if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group we writedown the asset or assets to their estimated fair values the estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands while other acquired intangible assets eg customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of definitelived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience the competitive and macroeconomic environment and our operating plans the costs of definitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life

we reduce the carrying amounts of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets

in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

if we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks we utilize a relief from royalty methodology the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital

goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or 

 

declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

in testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above furthermore management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit

under the quantitative impairment test the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a riskadjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period typically five years and the terminal period considering expected long term growth rates and trends estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in riskadjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit

as of may 30 2021 we have goodwill of 1137 billion indefinitelived intangibles of 330 billion and definitelived intangibles of 8564 million the amount of goodwill and intangibles increased significantly during fiscal 2019 as a result of the pinnacle acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we reorganized our reporting segments to incorporate the pinnacle business into our legacy reporting segments to reflect how the business is now being managed we tested goodwill for impairment both prior to and subsequent to the reallocation of pinnacle goodwill and there were no impairments of goodwill 

historically we have experienced impairments in brand intangibles and goodwill as a result of declining sales and other economic conditions for instance in fiscal 2021 and 2020 we recorded total intangibles impairments of 909 million and 1655 million respectively primarily related to our recently acquired pinnacle brands in fiscal 2019 we recorded total intangibles impairments of 896 million primarily related to our chef boyardee ® brand intangible 

with the addition of pinnacle intangibles that were recorded at fair value in fiscal 2019 we continue to be more susceptible to impairment charges in the future if our longterm sales forecasts royalty rates and other assumptions change as a result of lower than expected performance or other economic conditions we will monitor these assumptions as management continues to achieve expected synergies gross margin improvement and longterm sales growth on certain key brands acquired in the acquisition including but not limited to birds eye ®  duncan hines ®  gardein ® and vlasic ® 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies

commodity market risk

we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products nuts sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions

 

interest rate risk 

we may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt

as of may 30 2021 and may 31 2020 the fair value of our longterm debt including current installments was estimated at 976 billion and 1135 billion respectively based on current market rates as of may 30 2021 and may 31 2020 a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 6822 million and 7048 million respectively while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 7798 million and 8095 million respectively

foreign currency risk

in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities

valueatrisk var

we employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk including valueatrisk var models we perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions we use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of var that is used to monitor our daily risk the purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices our model uses a 95 confidence level accordingly in any given oneday time period losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5 of the time we include commodity swaps futures and options and foreign exchange forwards swaps and options in this calculation the following table provides an overview of our average daily var for our energy agriculture and foreign exchange positions for fiscal 2021 and 2020

general

the following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments

conagra brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded private branded and valueadded consumer food as well as foodservice items and ingredients we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources from time to time we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and the use of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption

we experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets our food items compete with widely advertised wellknown branded food as well as private branded and customized food items some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty

demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events for example sales of frozen foods tend to be marginally higher during the winter months seafood sales are highest during lent in advance of the easter holiday and production of certain of our products occurs seasonally during or immediately following the purchase of agricultural crops

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant

our intellectual property rights including our trademarks licensing agreements trade secrets patents and copyrights are of material importance to our business and we attempt to protect such rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws as well as entering into licensing thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others including pf chang’s ®  bertolli ®  and libby’s ® trademarks we also own certain intellectual property rights that are licensed to third parties such as the alexia ® trademark while many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to the terms of such licensing arrangement we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered

many of our facilities and products we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position

 

our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 26 of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2020 and 24 of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2019 and 2018  

as of may 31 2020 conagra brands and its subsidiaries had approximately 16500 employees primarily in the united states approximately 52 of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 5 are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during fiscal 2021 we believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good

 item 1a risk factors

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks 

 

and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

risks relating to our business

the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

in december 2019 there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 in china that has since spread to nearly all regions of the world the outbreak was subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 to date the covid19 outbreak and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the united states

in response to the covid19 pandemic and related mitigation measures we created an internal covid19 pandemic team in order to review and assess the evolving covid19 pandemic and began implementing changes in our business in march 2020 to protect our employees and customers and to support appropriate health and safety protocols for example we installed physical barriers between employees in production facilities implemented extensive cleaning and sanitation processes for both production and office spaces and implemented broad workfromhome initiatives for office personnel while all of these measures have been necessary and appropriate they have resulted in additional costs which we expect will continue in fiscal 2021 as we work to address employee safety

although we have experienced some challenges in connection with the covid19 pandemic including temporary closings of production facilities and reduced demand for certain of our products at this time we have not experienced a net negative impact on our liquidity or results of operations while we generally expect demand levels for our products to return to historical norms as we progress through fiscal 2021 we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the covid19 outbreak including the nature and timing of when such demand normalization may occur the continued spread of covid19 could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways in the future including but not limited to

















the situation surrounding the covid19 pandemic remains fluid and given its inherent uncertainty we expect that it could have an adverse impact on our business in the future the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers suppliers distributors and manufacturers should these conditions persist for a prolonged period the covid19 pandemic including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this item 1a risk factors any of which could have a material effect on us 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including 

 

fuel surcharges the negative impacts caused by pandemics and public health crises including the covid19 pandemic  and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows













our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations

as of may 31 2020 we had total debt of approximately 975 billion including approximately 944 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate that our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures

our level of debt could have important consequences for shareholders for example it could



















additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper in the event of a default the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due 

 

and payable any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits

the food industry is highly competitive and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases we sell branded private brand and customized food products as well as commercially branded foods our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors in addition when branded competitors focus on price and promotion the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume

in addition substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry the expanding presence of ecommerce retailers has impacted and may continue to impact consumer preferences and market dynamics which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry steel aluminum and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations in addition recent world events have increased the risks posed by international trade disputes tariffs and sanctions we procure a wide spectrum of commodities globally and could potentially face increased prices for commodities sourced from nations that could be impacted by trade disputes tariffs or sanctions commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material packaging and energy costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume reduced margins and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains wheat corn and oats oils beef pork poultry and energy changes in the values of these derivatives are generally recorded in earnings 

 

currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our restructuring plans including the pinnacle integration restructuring plan

in fiscal 2019 we announced a restructuring and integration plan related to the ongoing integration of pinnacle for the purpose of achieving significant cost synergies the pinnacle integration restructuring plan we expect to incur material charges for exit and disposal activities under us generally accepted accounting principles

the successful design and implementation of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges in many cases it will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the pinnacle integration restructuring plan may not advance our business strategy as expected events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings and cost synergies of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the pinnacle integration restructuring plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

in addition the complexity of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from existing core businesses integrating financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration and other federal state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws 

 

and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us

during fiscal 2020 our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 26 of our consolidated net sales there can be no assurance that walmart inc and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have continued to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business these consolidations the growth of supercenters and the growth of ecommerce customers have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their store brand products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label or store brand competition our profitability could decline

consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases

if we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our profitability

our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers any of these factors could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

if we are unable to complete our proposed divestitures our financial results could be materially and adversely affected

from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on 

 

the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability and margins moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems possible need for providing transition services to buyers adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics such as the coronavirus covid19 pandemic strikes government action or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

in particular we are actively monitoring the recent covid19 pandemic and its potential impact on our supply chain and our consolidated results of operations although our products are manufactured in north america and we source the significant majority of our ingredients and raw materials from north america due to restrictions resulting from the pandemic global supply may become constrained which may cause the price of certain ingredients and raw materials used in our products to increase andor we may experience disruptions to our operations 

any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities the failure to achieve any stated goals with respect to the nutritional profile of our products our research and development efforts or our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management moreover the growing use of social and digital media by consumers has greatly increased the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties in addition changes in such laws may lead to increased costs

our business is subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations including food and drug laws environmental laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws data privacy laws and anticorruption laws among others in and outside of the united states our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products in addition changes in applicable laws and regulations including changes in taxation requirements and new or increased tariffs on products imported from certain countries may lead to increased costs and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products and affect our net operating revenues 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes outside of our control such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures employee error or malfeasance security breaches computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing hacking and other cyberattacks while we have experienced threats to our data and systems to date we are not aware that we have experienced a material breach however over time and particularly recently the sophistication of these threats continues to increase sophisticated cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems including cloudbased platforms in addition new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyberattacks if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and associated automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results in addition there is a risk of business interruption violation of data privacy laws and regulations litigation and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business

additionally we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data including the european union general data protection regulation our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time

we rely on our management team and other key personnel

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results

in particular our continued success will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees if key employees terminate their employment become ill as a result of the covid19 pandemic or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations our business activities may be adversely affected and our management teams attention may be diverted in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms all of which could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth

as of may 31 2020 we had goodwill of 1144 billion and other intangibles of 432 billion the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks 

 

customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as the inability to quickly replace lost comanufacturing business increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the us and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as corn wheat and potatoes adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials lower recoveries of usable raw materials increase the prices of our raw materials increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials or disrupt our production schedules

we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations

due to the seasonality of the business our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter

our sales and cash flows are affected by seasonal cyclicality sales of frozen foods including frozen vegetables and frozen complete bagged meals tend to be marginally higher during the winter months seafood sales peak during lent in advance of the easter holiday since many of the raw materials we process are agricultural crops production of these products is predominantly seasonal occurring during and immediately following the purchase of such crops for these reasons sequential quarterly comparisons are not a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future if we are unable to obtain access to working capital or if seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

the termination or expiration of current comanufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations

our businesses periodically enter into comanufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products the terms of these agreements vary but are generally for relatively short periods of time volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the products life cycle product promotions alternative production capacity and other factors none of which are under our direct control our future ability to enter into comanufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed and a decrease in current comanufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume

 

as we outsource certain functions we become more dependent on the third parties performing those functions 

as part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies we have entered into agreements with thirdparty service providers under which we have outsourced certain information systems sales finance accounting and other functions and we may enter into managed services agreements with respect to other functions in the future if any of these thirdparty service providers do not perform according to the terms of the agreements or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers and our reputation could be harmed depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business interruption damage or disruption of information technology systems processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property or nonpublic company sensitive information through security breaches or otherwise effects on financial reporting litigation or remediation costs or damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition if we transition functions to one or more new or among existing external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our intellectual property rights including our trademarks licensing agreements trade secrets patents and copyrights are a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws as well as entering into licensing thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property if we fail to adequately protect the intellectual property rights we have now or may acquire in the future or if there occurs any change in law or otherwise that serves to reduce or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected

certain of our intellectual property rights including the pf changs ®  bertolli ®  and libbys ® trademarks are owned by third parties and licensed to us and others such as alexia ®  are owned by us and licensed to third parties while many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to the terms of such licensing arrangement if in the future we are unable to renew such a licensing arrangement pursuant to its terms and conditions or if we fail to renegotiate such a licensing arrangement then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected

there is also a risk that other parties may have intellectual property rights covering some of our brands products or technology if any third parties bring a claim of intellectual property infringement against us we may be subject to costly and timeconsuming litigation diverting the attention of management and our employees if we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims we may be subject to among other things significant damages injunctions against development and sale of certain products or we may be required to enter into costly licensing agreements any of which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our stock price may be subject to significant volatility and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result

the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons including reasons not specifically related to our performance such as industry or market trends reports by industry analysts and other third parties investor perceptions actions by credit rating agencies negative announcements by our customers or competitors regarding their own performance or actions taken by our competitors as well as general economic and industry conditions our common stock price is also affected by announcements we make about our business market data that is available to subscribers analyst reports related to our company changes in financial estimates by analysts whether or not we meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our company rating agency announcements about our business variations in our quarterly results of operations and those of our competitors general economic and stock market conditions future sales of our common stock perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives the publics reaction to our public announcements and filings with the sec actual or anticipated growth rates relative to our competitors and speculation by the investment community regarding our business among other factors

as a result of these factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock in addition the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us these broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in addition in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits the filing of a lawsuit against us regardless of the outcome could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources

 

we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the acquisition of pinnacle 

the benefits that are expected to result from the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as the result of the acquisition our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of pinnacle there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating a company as sizable as pinnacle the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in our activities members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage the company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer there can be no assurance that we will successfully or costeffectively integrate pinnacle the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

even if we are able to integrate pinnacle successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits that are currently expected from this acquisition and there can be no guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frames or at all for example we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs moreover we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of pinnacle while it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to or delays in integrating the business

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities or incur operational difficulties as a result of the spinoff

the spinoff continues to involve a number of risks including among other things certain indemnification risks and risk associated with the provision of transitional services in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a trademark license agreement which we refer to as the lamb weston agreements the lamb weston agreements govern the spinoff and the relationship between the two companies going forward they also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time

the lamb weston agreements provide for indemnification obligations designed to make lamb weston financially responsible for certain liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution including any pending or future litigation it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and lamb weston and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to lamb weston third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification we may have to bear costs temporarily in addition our indemnity obligations to lamb weston may be significant these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations

in addition certain of the lamb weston agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time as such there is continued risk that managements and our employees attention will be significantly diverted by the provision of transitional services the lamb weston agreements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations if lamb weston is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur losses our inability to effectively manage separation activities and related events could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

in december 2018 our board of directors the board approved a restructuring and integration plan related to the ongoing integration of the recently acquired operations of pinnacle the pinnacle integration restructuring plan for the purpose of achieving significant cost synergies between the companies as a result of which we expect to incur material charges for exit and disposal activities under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap we have approved the incurrence of up to 3600 million 2550 million of cash charges and 1050 million of noncash charges in connection with operational expenditures under the pinnacle integration restructuring plan

 

although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire pinnacle integration restructuring plan we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of fiscal 20 20  including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of cost expected to be incurred and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows we have incurred or expect to incur approximately  3602 million of charges 2 772 million of cash charges and  830 million of noncash charges for actions identified to date under the pinnacle integration restructuring plan w e recognized charges of  738 million and 1682 million in connection with the pinnacle integration restructuring plan in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect to incur costs related to the pinnacle integration restructuring plan through fiscal 2022

covid19

we are closely monitoring the impact of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid19 on all aspects of our business we experienced significantly higher sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 for our products in both of our grocery  snacks and refrigerated  frozen segments due to the covid19 pandemic as consumers increased their athome consumption we continue to see increased orders from retail customers in north america subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020 in response to increased consumer demand for food at home and expect that trend to continue for at least a portion of fiscal 2021 as workfromhome arrangements are extended in response to the continued spread of covid19 however the increased consumer demand may reverse in the coming months as consumer purchasing behavior changes as a result of the economic downturn during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we experienced reduced demand for our foodservice products across all of our major markets as consumer traffic in awayfromhome food outlets decreased as a result of the covid19 pandemic we expect this trend to continue for at least a portion of fiscal 2021 which will continue to negatively impact our net sales to customers in our foodservice segment while we generally expect retail and foodservice demand levels to return to historical norms as we progress through fiscal 2021 given the inherent uncertainty of the situation surrounding the covid19 pandemic we are unable to predict the nature and timing of when such normalization may occur 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 our operating margins saw improvement largely due to favorable overhead absorption at our manufacturing facilities lower advertising and promotion costs and reduced travel expenses that benefit was largely offset by several factors including higher transportation and warehousing costs temporary plant closures employee safety and sanitation costs and employee compensation costs which accounted for an estimated 40 million of incremental costs in the fourth quarter

we created an internal covid19 pandemic team in order to review and assess the evolving covid19 pandemic and to recommend risk mitigation actions for the health and safety of our employees in order to enhance the safety of our employees during the covid19 pandemic we have implemented various measures including the installation of physical barriers between employees in production facilities extensive cleaning and sanitation of both production and office spaces and implementation of broad workfromhome initiatives for office personnel while all of these measures have been necessary and appropriate they have resulted in additional costs which we expect to continue to incur throughout fiscal 2021 to continue to address employee safety the implementation of such safety measures has not resulted in any meaningful change to our control environment 

as mentioned above we have experienced some challenges in connection with the covid19 pandemic including temporary closings of production facilities and reduced demand for certain of our products despite these challenges there has been minimal disruption to our supply chain network to date including the supply of our ingredients packaging or other sourced materials however we are continuing to closely monitor the potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic as we cannot predict its ultimate impact on our suppliers distributors and manufacturers

at this time we have not experienced a net negative impact on our liquidity or results of operations and we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business consolidated results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

 

segment review

during fiscal 2020 we reorganized our reporting segments to incorporate the pinnacle business into our legacy reporting segments in order to better reflect how the business is now being managed we now reflect our results of operations in four reporting segments grocery  snacks refrigerated  frozen international and foodservice prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the revised segment presentation

grocery  snacks

the grocery  snacks reporting segment principally includes branded shelfstable food products sold in various retail channels in the united states

refrigerated  frozen

the refrigerated  frozen reporting segment principally includes branded temperaturecontrolled food products sold in various retail channels in the united states

international

the international reporting segment principally includes branded food products in various temperature states sold in various retail and foodservice channels outside of the united states

foodservice

the foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products including meals entrees sauces and a variety of custommanufactured culinary products that are packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments primarily in the united states

presentation of derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings in the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately

the following table presents the net derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions under this methodology

 



as of may 31 2020 the cumulative amount of net derivative losses from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was 41 million this amount reflected net losses of 45 million incurred during the fiscal year ended may 31 2020 as well as net gains of 04 million incurred prior to fiscal 2020 based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify to segment operating results net losses of 21 million in fiscal 2021 and 20 million in fiscal 2022 and thereafter

pension and postretirement nonservice income

in fiscal 2019 pension and postretirement nonservice income was 351 million a decrease of 453 million compared to fiscal 2018 the decrease was primarily related to lower expected return on plan assets as we changed our investment strategy to more fixed income securities 

interest expense net

in fiscal 2019 net interest expense was 3914 million an increase of 2327 million or 147 from fiscal 2018 the increase reflected the following













in addition fiscal 2019 included 119 million related to the amortization of costs incurred to secure fully committed bridge financing in connection with the thenpending pinnacle acquisition the bridge financing was subsequently terminated in 

 

connection with our incurrence of permanent financing to fund the pinnacle acquisition and we recognized the remaining unamortized financing costs of 338 million within sga expenses 

income taxes

our income tax expense was 2188 million and 1746 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings was approximately 24 and 18 for fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively

as a result of our offcalendar fiscal year end the lower us statutory federal income tax rate resulted in a blended us federal statutory rate of 293 for the fiscal year ended may 27 2018

the effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 reflects the following

equity method investment earnings

we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates our most significant affiliate is the ardent mills joint venture our share of earnings from our equity method investment earnings were 758 million and 973 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively results for fiscal 2019 included a gain of 151 million from the sale of an asset by the ardent mills joint venture in addition ardent mills earnings for fiscal 2019 reflected lower commodity margins and the timing of certain customer contracts that negatively impacted performance a benefit of 43 million was included in the earnings of fiscal 2018 in connection with a gain on the substantial liquidation of an international joint venture

 

results of discontinued operations 

our discontinued operations generated an aftertax loss of 19 million and a gain of 143 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively during fiscal 2018 a 145 million income tax benefit was recorded due to an adjustment of the estimated deductibility of the costs incurred associated with effecting the spinoff of lamb weston

earnings per share

diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 were 152 including earnings of 153 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of 001 per diluted share from discontinued operations diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018 were 198 including earnings of 195 per diluted share from continuing operations and 003 per diluted share from discontinued operations see  items impacting comparability  above as several significant items affected the comparability of yearoveryear results of operations

liquidity and capital resources

sources of liquidity and capital

the primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives if necessary we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories less accounts payable accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets we are committed to maintaining a solid investment grade credit rating

at may 31 2020 we had a revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of 16 billion subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 21 billion with the consent of the lenders we have historically used a credit facility principally as a backup for our commercial paper program as of may 31 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility

we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program as of may 31 2020 and may 26 2019 the highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2020 was 1450 million 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we entered into an unsecured term loan agreement the credit agreement with a financial institution the credit agreement provides for delayed draw term loans to the company in an aggregate principal amount not in excess of 600 million subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 750 million the credit agreement matures on may 21 2023 as of may 31 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement

borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at at the companys election either a libor plus a percentage spread ranging from 1125 to 175 based on the companys senior unsecured longterm indebtedness ratings or b the alternate base rate described in the credit agreement as the greatest of i the prime rate ii the federal funds rate plus 050 and iii onemonth libor plus 100 plus a percentage spread ranging from 0 to 0625 based on the companys senior unsecured longterm indebtedness ratings and may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part without penalty subject to certain conditions 

during fiscal 2020 we repaid the remaining 4000 million outstanding principal balance of our borrowings under our 130 billion term loan agreement payments totaling 2000 million each were made in the first and third quarters of fiscal 2020 on our threeyear tranche loans and our fiveyear tranche loans respectively the term loan agreement was terminated after these repayments 

during fiscal 2020 we also redeemed the entire outstanding 5250 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate notes due october 22 2020 in two separate redemptions totaling 2500 million and 2750 million in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 respectively 

we have 8448 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months we expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to retire or refinance longterm debt upon maturity as market conditions warrant from operating cash flows our undrawn credit agreement our commercial paper program access to the capital markets and our revolving credit facility 

 

however the disruption in the capital markets caused by the covid19 pandemic could make any refinancing more challenging and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully refinance any debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

as of the end of fiscal 2020 our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult or impossible

our most restrictive covenants the revolving credit facility generally require our ratio of ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense not be less than 30 to 10 and our ratio of funded debt to ebitda not exceed certain decreasing specified levels ranging from 525 through the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to 375 from the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and thereafter each ratio is to be calculated on a rolling fourquarter basis as of may 31 2020 we were in compliance with all financial covenants

we repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board under the share repurchase authorization we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years depending on market conditions and other factors and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date we plan to repurchase shares under our authorized program only at times and in amounts as are consistent with the prioritization of achieving our leverage targets our total remaining share repurchase authorization as of may 31 2020 was 141 billion

on april 16 2020 we announced that our board had authorized a quarterly dividend payment of 02125 per share which was paid on june 3 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on april 30 2020 subject to market and other conditions and the approval of our board we intend to maintain our quarterly dividend at the current annual rate of 085 per share during fiscal 2021

cash flows

in fiscal 2020 we generated 3167 million of cash which was the net result of 184 billion generated from operating activities 1538 million used in investing activities 137 billion used in financing activities and a decrease of 17 million due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled 184 billion in fiscal 2020 as compared to 111 billion generated in fiscal 2019 operating cash flows for fiscal 2020 reflected additional operating results from the acquisition of pinnacle and the impact of increased sales from covid19 pandemicrelated demand the timing of the increased demand in the fourth quarter also created working capital favorability for fiscal 2020 driven primarily by the combination of decreased inventory levels and increased accounts payable balances resulting from longer supplier payment terms we expect that a significant portion of this working capital favorability will reverse in fiscal 2021 as demand returns to more historic levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we also improved working capital due to approximately 47 million in tax payments that were deferred until the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of recent tax legislation despite the deferral of such tax payments we still had 442 million of additional tax payments in the current year the above working capital favorability was further offset by a 1190 million increase in interest payments and the comparative impact of cash proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps in fiscal 2019 totaling 475 million lastly we extended payment terms with certain foodservice customers ranging from 1530 days as a result of the covid19 pandemic which partly gave rise to an increase in our accounts receivable at yearend 

cash used in investing activities totaled 1538 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 517 billion in fiscal 2019 investing activities in fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures totaling 3695 million and the net proceeds from divestitures totaling 1946 million including the sales of our dsd snacks and lenders ® bagel businesses investing activities in fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of the purchase of pinnacle for 512 billion net of cash acquired capital expenditures of 3531 million and proceeds from the divestiture of our del monte ® processed fruit and vegetable business our wesson ® oil business and our italianbased frozen pasta business gelit for combined proceeds of 2815 million net of cash divested 

cash used in financing activities totaled 137 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 415 billion in fiscal 2019 financing activities in fiscal 2020 consisted principally of the repayment of longterm debt totaling 9475 million and cash dividends paid of 4136 million during fiscal 2019 in connection with the pinnacle acquisition we issued longterm debt that generated 831 billion in gross proceeds and issued common stock for net proceeds of 5557 million 

 

this was reduced by debt issuance costs and bridge financing fees totaling 952 million during fiscal 2019 we also repaid 397 billion of longterm debt reduced our shortterm borrowings mainly related to our commercial paper program by 2773 million and paid cash dividends of 3562 million 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of 5533 million at may 31 2020 and 2366 million at may 26 2019 of which 805 million at may 31 2020 and 1448 million at may 26 2019 was held in foreign countries we believe that our foreign subsidiaries have invested or will invest any undistributed earnings indefinitely or that any undistributed earnings will be remitted in a taxneutral transaction and therefore do not provide deferred taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 

our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 is approximately 505 million

management believes that existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our repayment of debt including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt working capital needs planned capital expenditures and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months

obligations and commitments

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements debt agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as takeorpay contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available of these items debt notes payable finance lease obligations and operating lease obligations were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets contained in this report as of may 31 2020

a summary of our contractual obligations as of may 31 2020 was as follows



1 amount includes open purchase orders and agreements some of which are not legally binding andor may be cancellable such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year purchase obligations and other contracts which totaled 138 billion as of may 31 2020 were not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets contained in this report in accordance with us gaap

we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our longterm debt and finance lease obligations the weightedaverage coupon interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 31 2020 was approximately 48

the operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by noncancellable sublease rentals of 59 million

as of may 31 2020 we had aggregate unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations totaling 521 million and 864 million respectively our unfunded pension obligation decreased by 796 million in fiscal 2020 primarily due to lumpsum payments to plan participants and actual return on plan assets exceeding expected returns principally on fixed income securities these amounts are not included in the table above as the unfunded obligations are remeasured each fiscal year thereby resulting in our inability to accurately predict the ultimate amount and timing of any future required contributions to such plans based on current statutory requirements we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next twelve months we estimate that we will make payments of approximately 322 million and 100 million over the next twelve months to fund our pension and postretirement plans respectively see note 18  pension and postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements and  critical accounting estimates – employmentrelated benefits  contained in this report for further discussion of our pension obligations and factors that could affect estimates of this liability

 

as part of our ongoing operations we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event  as of may 31 2020  we had 5 2  2 million of standby letters of credit issued on our behalf these standby letters of credit are primarily related to our selfinsured workers compensation programs and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

in certain limited situations we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity we guarantee certain leases resulting from the divestiture of the jm swank business completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as of may 31 2020 the remaining terms of these arrangements did not exceed three years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was 06 million in addition we guarantee a lease resulting from an exited facility as of may 31 2020 the remaining term of this arrangement did not exceed seven years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was 165 million

we also guarantee an obligation of the lamb weston business pursuant to a guarantee arrangement that existed prior to the spinoff and remained in place following completion of the spinoff until such guarantee obligation is substituted for guarantees issued by lamb weston pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement dated as of november 8 2016 the separation agreement between us and lamb weston this guarantee arrangement is deemed a liability of lamb weston that was transferred to lamb weston as part of the spinoff accordingly in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of this guarantee arrangement lamb weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us in accordance with the terms of the indemnification provisions under the separation agreement lamb weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a third party for certain farmland through 2020 subject at lamb westons option to extension for two additional fiveyear periods under the terms of the sublease agreement lamb weston is required to make certain rental payments to the sublessor we have guaranteed lamb westons performance and the payment of all amounts including indemnification obligations owed by lamb weston under the sublease agreement up to a maximum of 750 million we believe the farmland associated with this sublease agreement is readily marketable for lease to other area farming operators as such we believe that any financial exposure to the company in the event that we were required to perform under the guaranty would be largely mitigated

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 31 2020 was 358 million the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 31 2020 that if recognized would favorably impact our effective tax rate was 303 million recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate

critical accounting estimates

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management

our auditfinance committee has reviewed managements development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates

marketing costs —we offer various forms of trade promotions which are mostly recorded as a reduction in revenue the methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to provisions based on actual occurrence or performance our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and included activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 

we have recognized trade promotion liabilities of 1656 million as of may 31 2020 changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the 

 

taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our consolidated balance sheets as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 14 pretax income and income taxes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup managements estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately 637 million for environmental liabilities as of may 31 2020 the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers compensation in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 

the company uses a split discount rate the spotrate approach for the us plans and certain foreign plans the spotrate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost 

we have recognized a pension liability of 2545 million and 1929 million a postretirement liability of 893 million and 906 million and a workers compensation liability of 555 million and 611 million as of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively we also have recognized a pension asset of 2024 million and 612 million as of the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status

we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation the corridor in current period expense annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when measurement is required otherwise under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap

we recognized pension expense benefit from company plans of 59 million 227 million and 561 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively such amounts reflect the yearend writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability of 448 million 51 million and 34 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively this also reflected 

 

expected returns on plan assets of 170 2 million 1744 million and 2183 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we contributed 175 million  14  7 million and  312  6 million to the pension plans of our continuing operations in fiscal 20 20  201 9  and 201 8  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  32  2 million to our pension plans in fiscal 202 1  

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate we use a spotrate approach discussed above this approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a highquality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate approach

based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 388 for fiscal 2020 415 for fiscal 2019 and 390 for fiscal 2018 we selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 335 and 230 for determination of service and interest expense respectively for fiscal 2021 a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2020 would have resulted in an increase of 51 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2020 a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2020 would have resulted in a decrease of 55 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2020 for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected discount rates of 298 and 388 for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plans investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 477 for the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2020 pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2020 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by 88 million we selected a weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets of 374 to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2021 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2021 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by 93 million

during fiscal 2018 we approved an amendment of our salaried and nonqualified pension plans the amendment froze the compensation and service periods used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in those plans as a result of this amendment we changed our salaried and nonqualified pension asset investment strategy to align our related pension plan assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility

during 2018 we conducted a mortality experience study and with the assistance of our thirdparty actuary adopted new companyspecific mortality tables used in measuring our pension obligations as of may 27 2018 in addition we incorporated a revised mortality improvement scale to be used with the new companyspecific mortality tables that reflects the mortality improvement inherent in these tables

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense benefit of 42 million 13 million and 07 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 100 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2021

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates also discussed above and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 348 for fiscal 2020 381 for fiscal 2019 and 333 for fiscal 2018 we have selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 239 for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2021 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 622 with the trend rate decreasing to 443 by 2024 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects

 



 

we provide workers compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the weightedaverage discount rate used at may 31 2020 was 2 11  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense or the liability 

business combinations impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets and goodwill —we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets including property plant and equipment to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable we generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group no impairment is recognized if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group we writedown the asset or assets to their estimated fair values the estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands while other acquired intangible assets eg customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of definitelived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience the competitive and macroeconomic environment and our operating plans the costs of definitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life

we reduce the carrying amounts of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets

in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

if we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks we utilize a relief from royalty methodology the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital

goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment 

 

has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

in testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above furthermore management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit

under the quantitative impairment test the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a riskadjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period typically five years and the terminal period considering expected long term growth rates and trends estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in riskadjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit

as of may 31 2020 we have goodwill of 1144 billion indefinitelived intangibles of 340 billion and definitelived intangibles of 9196 million the amount of goodwill and intangibles increased significantly during fiscal 2019 as a result of the pinnacle acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we reorganized our reporting segments to incorporate the pinnacle business into our legacy reporting segments to reflect how the business is now being managed we tested goodwill for impairment both prior to and subsequent to the reallocation of pinnacle goodwill and there were no impairments of goodwill 

historically we have experienced impairments in brand intangibles and goodwill as a result of declining sales and other economic conditions for instance in fiscal 2020 we recorded total intangibles impairments of 1655 million primarily related to our recently acquired pinnacle brands in fiscal 2019 we recorded total intangibles impairments of 896 million primarily related to our chef boyardee ® brand intangible 

with the addition of pinnacle intangibles that were recorded at fair value in the prior year we continue to be more susceptible to impairment charges in the future if our longterm sales forecasts royalty rates and other assumptions change as a result of lower than expected performance or other economic conditions we will monitor these assumptions as management continues to achieve expected synergies gross margin improvement and longterm sales growth on certain key brands acquired in the acquisition including but not limited to birds eye ®  duncan hines ®  and gardein ®  

recently issued accounting pronouncements

in june 2016 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu 201613 financial instruments—credit losses  topic 326  measurement of credit losses on financial instruments asu 201613 to update the methodology used to measure current expected credit losses cecl this asu applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost including loans heldtomaturity debt securities net investments in leases and trade accounts receivable as well as certain offbalance sheet credit exposures such as loan commitments this asu replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology to reflect cecl and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to explain credit loss estimates the guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption this asu will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2021 we do not expect asu 201613 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies

commodity market risk

we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products nuts sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions

interest rate risk

we may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt

as of may 31 2020 and may 26 2019 the fair value of our longterm debt including current installments was estimated at 1135 billion and 1124 billion respectively based on current market rates as of may 31 2020 and may 26 2019 a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 7048 million and 6377 million respectively while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 8095 million and 7247 million respectively

foreign currency risk

in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities

valueatrisk var

we employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk including valueatrisk var models we perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions we use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of var that is used to monitor our daily risk the purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices our model uses a 95 confidence level accordingly in any given oneday time period losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5 of the time we include commodity swaps futures and options and foreign exchange forwards swaps and options in this calculation the following table provides an overview of our average daily var for our energy agriculture and foreign exchange positions for fiscal 2020 and 2019

general 

the following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments 

conagra brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded private branded and valueadded consumer food as well as foodservice items and ingredients we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources from time to time we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and the use of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption 

we experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets our food items compete with widely advertised wellknown branded food as well as private branded and customized food items some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related food items are sold some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

many of our facilities and products we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 24  of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  

as of may 26 2019  conagra brands and its subsidiaries had approximately 18000  employees primarily in the united states approximately 51  of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 23  are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during fiscal 2020  we believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good

as of may 26 2019 we had total debt of approximately 1068 billion including approximately 996 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes total debt increased 686 billion since may 27 2018 and reflects in part indebtedness incurred to complete the pinnacle acquisition we have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur substantial additional debt our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate that our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general 

economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures 

our level of debt could have important consequences for shareholders for example it could 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt service obligations 

• restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or taking advantage of favorable business opportunities 

• restrict us from repurchasing shares of our common stock 

 • limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness or increase the cost of such indebtedness 

 • increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions including changes in interest rates 

 • place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt 

additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper in the event of a default the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

the food industry is highly competitive and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases we sell branded private brand and customized food products as well as commercially branded foods our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors in addition when branded competitors focus on price and promotion the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower 

prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

in addition substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry the expanding presence of ecommerce retailers has impacted and may continue to impact consumer preferences and market dynamics which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits 

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry steel   aluminum and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations in addition recent world events have increased the risks posed by international trade disputes tariffs and sanctions we procure a wide spectrum of commodities globally and could potentially face increased prices for commodities sourced from nations that could be impacted by trade disputes tariffs or sanctions commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material packaging and energy costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume reduced margins and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains wheat corn and oats oils beef pork poultry and energy changes in the values of these derivatives are generally recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations and in unallocated general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our restructuring plans including the pinnacle integration restructuring plan 

in fiscal 2019 we announced a restructuring and integration plan related to the ongoing integration of the recently acquired operations of pinnacle the pinnacle integration restructuring plan for the purpose of achieving significant cost synergies between the companies we expect to incur material charges for exit and disposal activities under us generally accepted accounting principles 

the successful design and implementation of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges in many cases it will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the pinnacle integration restructuring plan may not advance our business strategy as expected events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings and cost synergies of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the pinnacle integration restructuring plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the complexity of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the pinnacle integration restructuring plan these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from existing core businesses integrating financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration and other federal state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act the fdca and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us 

during fiscal 2019 our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 24  of our consolidated net sales there can be no assurance that walmart inc and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have continued to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business these consolidations the growth of supercenters and the growth of ecommerce customers have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their store brand products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label or store brand competition our profitability could decline 

consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

if we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers any of these factors could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

in fiscal 2019 we completed the acquisition of pinnacle for consideration of approximately 803 billion which consisted of 1 cash of 517 billion 512 billion net of cash acquired 2 775 million company shares with an approximate value of 282 billion issued out of the companys treasury to former holders of pinnacle stock and 3 replacement awards issued to former pinnacle employees representing the fair value attributable to precombination service of 511 million see we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the acquisition of pinnacle below for more information 

if we are unable to complete our proposed divestitures our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability and margins moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems possible need for providing transition services to buyers adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes government action or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities the failure to achieve any stated goals with respect to the nutritional profile of our products our research and development efforts or our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management moreover the growing use of social and digital media by consumers has greatly increased the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties in addition changes in such laws may lead to increased costs 

our business is subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations including food and drug laws environmental laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws data privacy laws and anticorruption laws among others in and outside of the united states our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products in addition changes in applicable laws and regulations including changes in taxation requirements and new or increased tariffs on products imported from certain countries may lead to increased costs and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products and affect our net operating revenues 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and potential disruption cyberattacks security problems and expanding social media vehicles present new risks 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes outside of our control such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures employee error or malfeasance security breaches computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing hacking and other cyberattacks increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results in addition there is a risk of business interruption violation of data privacy laws and regulations litigation and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about the company on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation in addition the disclosure of nonpublic company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

additionally we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations including the european union general data protection regulation the gdpr which imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws including the gdpr may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time 

we rely on our management team and other key personnel 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in particular our continued success will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees if key employees terminate their employment or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations our business activities may be adversely affected and our management teams attention may be diverted in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms all of which could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

as of may 26 2019 we had goodwill of 1150 billion  and other intangibles of 466 billion  the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as the inability to quickly replace lost comanufacturing business increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and   negatively impact our net worth 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the us and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as corn wheat and potatoes adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials lower recoveries of usable raw materials increase the prices of our raw materials increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials or disrupt our production schedules 

we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

due to the seasonality of the business our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter 

our sales and cash flows are affected by seasonal cyclicality sales of frozen foods including frozen vegetables and frozen complete bagged meals tend to be marginally higher during the winter months seafood sales peak during lent in advance of the easter holiday since many of the raw materials we process are agricultural crops production of these products is predominantly seasonal occurring during and immediately following the purchase of such crops for these reasons sequential quarterly comparisons are not a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future if we are unable to obtain access to working capital or if seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the termination or expiration of current comanufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations 

our businesses periodically enter into comanufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products the terms of these agreements vary but are generally for relatively short periods of time volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the products life cycle product promotions alternative production capacity and other factors none of which are under our direct control our future ability to enter into comanufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed and a decrease in current comanufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume 

ardent mills may not achieve the benefits that are anticipated from the joint venture 

the benefits that are expected to result from our ardent mills joint venture will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated cost synergies in the transaction ardent mills ability to successfully integrate the conagra mills and horizon milling businesses and its ability to successfully manage the joint venture on a goingforward basis it is not certain that we will realize these benefits at all and if we do it is not certain how long it will take to achieve these benefits if for example we are unable to achieve the anticipated cost savings or if there are unforeseen integration costs or if ardent mills is unable to operate the joint venture smoothly in the future the financial performance of the joint venture may be negatively affected 

as we outsource certain functions we become more dependent on the third parties performing those functions 

as part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies we have entered into agreements with thirdparty service providers under which we have outsourced certain information systems sales finance accounting and other functions and we may enter into managed services agreements with respect to other functions in the future if any of these thirdparty service providers do not perform according to the terms of the agreements or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers and our reputation could be harmed depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business interruption damage or disruption of information technology systems processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property or nonpublic company sensitive information through security breaches or otherwise effects on financial reporting litigation or remediation costs or damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition if we transition functions to one or more new or among existing external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights including our trademarks licensing agreements trade secrets patents and copyrights are a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws as well as entering into licensing thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property if we fail to adequately protect the intellectual property rights we have now or may acquire in the future or if there occurs any change in law or otherwise that serves to reduce or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

certain of our intellectual property rights including the pf changs ®  bertolli ®  and libbys ®  trademarks are owned by third parties and licensed to us and others such as alexia ®  are owned by us and licensed to third parties while many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to the terms of such licensing arrangement if in the future we are unable to renew such a licensing arrangement pursuant to its terms and conditions or if we fail to renegotiate such a licensing arrangement then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

there is also a risk that other parties may have intellectual property rights covering some of our brands products or technology if any third parties bring a claim of intellectual property infringement against us we may be subject to costly and timeconsuming litigation diverting the attention of management and our employees if we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims we may be subject to among other things significant damages injunctions against development and sale of certain products or we may be required to enter into costly licensing agreements any of which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our stock price may be subject to significant volatility and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons including reasons not specifically related to our performance such as industry or market trends reports by industry analysts and other third parties investor perceptions actions by credit rating agencies negative announcements by our customers or competitors regarding their own performance or actions taken by our competitors as well as general economic and industry conditions our common stock price is also affected by announcements we make about our business market data that is available to subscribers analyst reports related to our company changes in financial estimates by analysts whether or not we meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our company rating agency announcements about our business variations in our quarterly results of operations and those of our competitors general economic and stock market conditions future sales of our common stock perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives the publics reaction to our public announcements and filings with the sec actual or anticipated growth rates relative to our competitors and speculation by the investment community regarding our business among other factors 

as a result of these factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock in addition the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us these broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in addition in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits the filing of a lawsuit against us regardless of the outcome could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources 

we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the acquisition of pinnacle 

the benefits that are expected to result from the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as the result of the acquisition our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of pinnacle there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating a company as sizable as pinnacle the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in our activities members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage the company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer there can be no assurance that we will successfully or costeffectively integrate pinnacle the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we are able to integrate pinnacle successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits that are currently expected from this acquisition and there can be no guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frames or at all for example we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs moreover we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of pinnacle while it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to or delays in integrating the business 

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities or incur operational difficulties as a result of the spinoff 

the spinoff continues to involve a number of risks including among other things certain indemnification risks and risk associated with the provision of transitional services in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a trademark license agreement which we refer to as the lamb weston agreements the lamb weston agreements govern the spinoff and the relationship between the two companies going forward they also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time 

the lamb weston agreements provide for indemnification obligations designed to make lamb weston financially responsible for certain liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution including any pending or future litigation it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to 

between us and lamb weston and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to lamb weston third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification we may have to bear costs temporarily in addition our indemnity obligations to lamb weston may be significant these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain of the lamb weston agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time as such there is continued risk that managements and our employees attention will be significantly diverted by the provision of transitional services the lamb weston agreements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations if lamb weston is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur losses our inability to effectively manage separation activities and related events could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we are a party to certain litigation matters relating to our acquisition of beatrice company beatrice in fiscal 1991 including litigation proceedings related to businesses divested by beatrice prior to our acquisition of the company these proceedings include suits against a number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers including conagra grocery products company llc a wholly owned subsidiary of the company conagra grocery products as alleged successor to w p fuller  co a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by a predecessor to beatrice from 1962 until 1967 these lawsuits generally seek damages for personal injury property damage economic loss and governmental expenditures allegedly caused by the use of leadbased paint andor injunctive relief for inspection and abatement although decisions favorable to us have been rendered in rhode island new jersey wisconsin and ohio we remain a defendant in active suits in illinois and california conagra grocery products has denied liability in both suits both on the merits of the claims and 

on the basis that we do not believe it to be the successor to any liability attributable to w p fuller  co the california suit is discussed in the following paragraph the illinois suit seeks classwide relief for reimbursement of costs associated with the testing of lead levels in blood we do not believe it is probable that we have incurred any liability with respect to the illinois case nor is it possible to estimate any potential exposure 

in california a number of cities and counties joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of an alleged public nuisance in the form of leadbased paint potentially present on the interior of residences regardless of its condition on september 23 2013 a trial of the california case concluded in the superior court of california for the county of santa clara and on january 27 2014 the court entered a judgment the judgment against conagra grocery products and two other defendants ordering the creation of a california abatement fund in the amount of  115 billion  liability is joint and several the company appealed the judgment and on november 14 2017 the california court of appeal for the sixth appellate district reversed in part holding that the defendants were not liable to pay for abatement of homes built after 1950 but affirmed the judgment as to homes built before 1951 the court of appeal remanded the case to the trial court with directions to recalculate the amount of the abatement fund estimated to be necessary to cover the cost of remediating pre1951 homes and to hold an evidentiary hearing regarding appointment of a suitable receiver conagra grocery products and the other defendants petitioned the california supreme court for review of the decision which we believe to be an unprecedented expansion of current california law on february 14 2018 the california supreme court denied the petition and declined to review the merits of the case and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings conagra grocery products and the other defendants sought further review of certain issues from the supreme court of the united states but on october 15 2018 the supreme court declined to review the case on september 4 2018 the trial court recalculated its estimate of the amount needed to remediate pre1951 homes in the plaintiff jurisdictions to be 4090 million as of july 10 2019 the parties reached an agreement in principle to resolve this matter which agreement remains subject to approval by the trial court once approved the action against conagra grocery products will be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the settlement conagra grocery products will pay a total of 1017 million in seven installments to be paid annually from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2026 conagra grocery products will further provide a guarantee of up to 150 million in the event codefendant nl industries inc defaults on its payment obligations

presentation of derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results 

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings in the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately 

the following table presents the net derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions associated with continuing operations under this methodology 



as of may 26 2019  the cumulative amount of net derivative gains from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was 14 million  this amount reflected net gains of  10 million  incurred during the fiscal year ended may 26 2019  as well as net gains of  04 million  incurred prior to fiscal 2019 based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify to segment operating results gains of 09 million  in fiscal 2020  and 05 million  in fiscal 2021  and thereafter

sources of liquidity and capital 

the primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives if necessary we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories less accounts payable accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets we are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating 

at may 26 2019  we had a revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of 16 billion subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 21 billion with the consent of the lenders we have historically used a credit facility principally as a backup for our commercial paper program as of may 26 2019  there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility

the revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement generally require that our ratio of ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense not be less than 30 to 10 and our ratio of funded debt to ebitda not exceed certain decreasing specified levels ranging from 5875 through the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to 375 from the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and thereafter each ratio is to be calculated on a rolling fourquarter basis as of may 26 2019  we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

as of the end of fiscal 2019 our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult or impossible 

on october 12 2018 we issued approximately 163 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering for proceeds of 5557 million net of related fees

we have access to our revolving credit facility our commercial paper program and the capital markets we believe we also have access to additional bank loan facilities if needed 

we expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to retire or refinance longterm debt upon maturity as market conditions warrant from operating cash flows our commercial paper program proceeds from any divestitures and other disposition transactions access to capital markets and our revolving credit facility

cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled  111 billion  in fiscal 2019  as compared to  9197 million  generated in fiscal 2018  the increase in operating cash flows was primarily the net result of decreased pension plan payments additional cash generated from pinnacle operations since the pinnacle acquisition proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps in fiscal 2019 reduced tax payments and changes in working capital partially offset by increased interest payments and costs associated with the pinnacle acquisition pension plan payments in fiscal 2018 included a voluntary contribution totaling 3000 million net income tax payment reductions totaling 303 million were impacted by corporate tax rate reductions resulting from the tax act signed into law during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 interest payments increased by 2111 million resulting from debt issued in connection with the pinnacle acquisition and the repayment of amounts accrued by pinnacle prior to the acquisition

our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2020  is approximately 400 million 

management believes that existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our repayment of debt including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt working capital needs planned capital expenditures and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months

weston is required to make certain rental payments to the sublessor we have guaranteed lamb westons performance and the payment of all amounts including indemnification obligations owed by lamb weston under the sublease agreement up to a maximum of 750 million  we believe the farmland associated with this sublease agreement is readily marketable for lease to other area farming operators as such we believe that any financial exposure to the company in the event that we were required to perform under the guaranty would be largely mitigated 

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 26 2019  was 441 million  the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 26 2019  that if recognized would favorably impact our effective tax rate was 373 million  recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management 

our auditfinance committee has reviewed managements development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

marketing costs —we offer various forms of trade promotions which are mostly recorded as a reduction in revenue the methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to provisions based on actual occurrence or performance our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 

we have recognized trade promotion liabilities of 1436 million  as of may 26 2019  changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program   would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows 

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our consolidated balance sheets as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 15 pretax income and income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order 

to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup managements estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately  568 million  for environmental liabilities as of may 26 2019  the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy 

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers compensation in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 

beginning in fiscal 2017 the company has elected to use a split discount rate the spotrate approach for the us plans and certain foreign plans historically a single weightedaverage discount rate was used in the calculation of service and interest costs both of which are components of pension benefit costs the spotrate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost this change is considered a change in accounting estimate and has been applied prospectively the pretax reduction in total pension benefit cost associated with this change in fiscal 2017 was approximately 270 million  

we have recognized a pension liability of  1929 million  and  1715 million  a postretirement liability of  906 million  and  1182 million  and a workers compensation liability of  611 million  and  394 million  as of the end of fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively we also have recognized a pension asset of  612 million  and  1030 million  as of the end of fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status 

we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation the corridor in current period expense annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when measurement is required otherwise under us gaap 

we recognized pension benefit including activities of discontinued operations from company plans of  227 million   561 million  and  129 million  in fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively such amounts reflect the yearend writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability of 51 million 34 million and 12 million in fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of  1744 million   2183 million  and  2074 million  in fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively we contributed  147 million   3126 million  and  1630 million  to the pension plans of our continuing operations in fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  142 million  to our pension plans in fiscal 2020 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate we use a spotrate approach discussed above this approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a highquality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate approach 

based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 415  for fiscal 2019  390  for fiscal 2018  and 383  for fiscal 2017  we selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 404  and 351  for determination of service and interest expense respectively for fiscal 2020  a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2019  would have resulted in an increase of  40 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2019  a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2019  would have resulted in a decrease 

of  43 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2019  for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected discount rates of 388  and 414  for fiscal years 2019  and 2018  respectively 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plans investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 517  for the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2019  pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2019  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by  82 million  we selected a weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets of 477  to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2020 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2020  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by 88 million  

during fiscal 2018 we approved an amendment of our salaried and nonqualified pension plans the amendment froze the compensation and service periods used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in those plans as a result of this amendment we changed our salaried and nonqualified pension asset investment strategy to align our related pension plan assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility 

in october 2016 the society of actuaries retirement plan experience committee published updated mortality improvement scales and recommended their use with base mortality tables for the measurement of us pension plan obligations with the assistance of our thirdparty actuary in measuring our pension obligations as of may 28 2017 we incorporated a revised improvement scale to be used with our current base mortality tables that generally reflect the mortality improvement inherent in these new tables 

 during 2018 we conducted a mortality experience study and with the assistance of our thirdparty actuary adopted new companyspecific mortality tables used in measuring our pension obligations as of may 27 2018 in addition we incorporated a revised mortality improvement scale to be used with the new companyspecific mortality tables that reflects the mortality improvement inherent in these tables 

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense benefit of  13 million   07 million  and  12 million  in fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively we reflected liabilities of  906 million  and  1182 million  in our balance sheets as of may 26 2019  and may 27 2018  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  108 million  to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2020  

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates also discussed above and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 381  for fiscal 2019  333  for fiscal 2018  and 318  for fiscal 2017  we have selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 348  for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2020  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 720 with the trend rate decreasing to 45 by 2024 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 



we provide workers compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the weightedaverage discount rate used at may 26 2019  was 248 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense or the liability 

business combinations impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets and goodwill —we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets including property plant and equipment to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable we generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group no impairment is recognized if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group we writedown the asset or assets to their estimated fair values the estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group 

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands while other acquired intangible assets eg customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of definitelived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience the competitive and macroeconomic environment and our operating plans the costs of definitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 

we reduce the carrying amounts of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets 

in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

if we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks we utilize a relief from royalty methodology the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment 

has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

in testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

under the quantitative impairment test the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a riskadjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period typically four or five years and the terminal period considering expected long term growth rates and trends estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in riskadjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit 

prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value we completed a second step of the test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss if any to be recognized in the second step we estimated an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the impairment loss was equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill as a result of adopting accounting standards update asu 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

as of may 26 2019 we have goodwill of 1150 billion  indefinitelived intangibles of 368 billion  and definitelived intangibles of 9834 million the amount of goodwill and intangibles increased significantly during fiscal 2019 as a result of the pinnacle acquisition during fiscal 2020 as part of our organizational realignment and integration activities we intend to allocate pinnacle intangibles to the applicable conagra reporting units historically we have experienced impairments in brand intangibles and goodwill as a result of declining sales and other economic conditions for instance in fiscal 2019 we recorded total intangibles impairments of 896 million primarily related to our chef boyardee ®  brand intangible with the addition of pinnacle intangibles we have significant indefinitelived brand intangibles such as birds eye ®  duncan hines ®  and wishbone ®  among others that were recorded at fair value in purchase accounting accordingly we could be more susceptible to impairment charges in the future if our longterm sales forecasts and other assumptions change as a result of lower than expected performance or other economic conditions we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible asset equals or exceeds its carrying value 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 201602 leases  topic 842  which requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations the effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we are evaluating the effect that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures we have identified an accounting system to support the future state lease accounting process and continue to develop the future state process design as part of the overall system implementation we have populated the accounting system with lease data and have validated the completeness and accuracy of such data we expect the adoption of this standard to result in an increase in total assets and liabilities related to operating 

leases that are currently not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet however we do not expect there to be a material impact to our earnings or cash flows see note 16 leases  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for the total amount of our noncancelable operating lease commitments the standard can be applied using the modified retrospective method or entities may also elect the optional transition method provided under asu 201811 leases topic 842 targeted improvement  issued in july 2018 allowing for application of the standard at the adoption date with recognition of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption we will adopt this asu on the first day of our fiscal year 2020 using the optional transition method and will elect certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance including not reassessing whether existing contracts contain leases and carrying forward the historical classification of leases 

in august 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201815 intangiblesgoodwill and otherinternaluse software subtopic 35040  customers accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract  which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internaluse software and hosting arrangements that include an internaluse software license the effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted the amendments in this asu should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption we do not expect asu 201815 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2019  and 2018  were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies 

commodity market risk 

we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products nuts sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions 

interest rate risk 

we may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt 

as of may 26 2019  and may 27 2018  the fair value of our longterm debt including current installments was estimated at  1124 billion  and 376 billion  respectively based on current market rates as of may 26 2019  and may 27 2018  a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 6377 million and 1681 million respectively while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 7247 million and 1857 million respectively 

foreign currency risk 

in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 

valueatrisk var 

we employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk including valueatrisk var models we perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions we use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of var that is used to monitor our daily risk the purpose of this measurement 

is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices our model uses a 95 confidence level accordingly in any given oneday time period losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5 of the time we include commodity swaps futures and options and foreign exchange forwards swaps and options in this calculation the following table provides an overview of our average daily var for our energy agriculture and foreign exchange positions for fiscal 2019  and 2018

disclosure controls and procedures 

the companys management carried out an evaluation with the participation of the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as of may 26 2019  based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective we acquired pinnacle on october 26 2018 and have not yet included pinnacle in our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting accordingly pursuant to the secs general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of an assessment in the year of acquisition the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures does not include pinnacle for fiscal 2019 pinnacle accounted for 173 billion of our total net sales and as of may 26 2019  had total assets of 1206 billion 

internal control over financial reporting 

the companys management with the participation of the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated any change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report and determined that there was no change in the companys internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal control over financial reporting 

managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

conagra brands management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of conagra brands as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended conagra brands internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles conagra brands internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of conagra brands ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of conagra brands are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of conagra brands and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of conagra brands assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

with the participation of conagra brands chief executive officer and chief financial officer management assessed the effectiveness of conagra brands internal control over financial reporting as of may 26 2019  managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of may 26 2019  excludes internal control over financial reporting related to pinnacle acquired october 26 2018 which accounted for approximately 1206 billion of consolidated total assets and 173 billion of consolidated net sales as of and for the year ended may 26 2019 in making this assessment management used criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso as a result of this assessment management concluded that as of may 26 2019  its internal control over financial reporting was effective

general 

the following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments 

conagra brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded private branded and valueadded consumer food as well as foodservice items and ingredients we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources from time to time we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and the use of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption 

we experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets our food items compete with widely advertised wellknown branded food as well as private branded and customized food items some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related food items are sold some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

many of our facilities and products we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects 

and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 24  of consolidated net sales for both fiscal 2018  and 2017  and 23  of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016  

at may 27 2018  conagra brands and its subsidiaries had approximately 12400  employees primarily in the united states approximately 43  of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 47  are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during fiscal 2019  we believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good 

research and development 

we employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition we conduct research activities related to the development of new products research and development expense was 473 million  446 million  and 596 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

risks relating to our business 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

 increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

the food industry is highly competitive and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases we sell branded private brand and customized food products as well as commercially branded foods our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors in addition when branded competitors focus on price and promotion the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry steel   aluminum and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations in addition recent world events have increased the risks posed by international trade disputes tariffs and sanctions we procure a wide spectrum of commodities globally and could potentially face increased prices for commodities sourced from nations that could be impacted by trade disputes tariffs or sanctions commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material packaging and energy costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume reduced margins and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains wheat corn and oats oils beef pork poultry and energy changes in the values of these derivatives are generally recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations and in unallocated general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our supply chain and administrative efficiency plan or scae plan 

in may 2013 we announced the supply chain and administrative efficiency plan the scae plan our plan to integrate and restructure the operations of our private brands business improve selling general and administrative sga effectiveness and efficiencies and optimize our supply chain network manufacturing assets dry distribution centers and mixing centers in fiscal 2016 we announced plans to realize efficiency benefits by reducing sga expenses and enhancing trade spend processes and tools which plans were included in the scae plan although we divested the private brands business we have continued to implement the scae plan including by working to optimize our supply chain network pursue cost reductions through our sga functions enhance trade spend processes and tools and improve productivity 

the successful design and implementation of the scae plan presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the scae plan may not advance our business strategy as expected events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the scae plan our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the scae plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the complexity of the scae plan will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the scae plan these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from existing core businesses integrating financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration and other federal state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act the fdca and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us 

during fiscal 2018 our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 24  of our consolidated net sales there can be no assurance that walmart inc and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have continued to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business these consolidations the growth of supercenters and the growth of online customers have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their store brand products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label or store brand competition our profitability could decline 

consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

if we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers any of these factors could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

in fiscal 2018 we completed the acquisitions of the sandwich bros of wisconsin ®  business for 873 million in cash net of cash acquired including working capital adjustments and the angies artisan treats llc business which included the angies ®  boomchickapop ®  readytoeat popcorn brand for 2498 million in cash net of cash acquired including working capital adjustments in fiscal 2019 we entered into a definitive merger agreement with pinnacle pursuant to which among other things and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions we plan to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of pinnacle for cash and shares of conagra brands common stock see risks relating to our planned acquisition of pinnacle below for more information on risks relating to the planned acquisition of pinnacle 

if we are unable to complete our proposed divestitures our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability and margins moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems possible need for providing transition services to buyers adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes government action or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities the failure to achieve any stated goals with respect to the nutritional profile of our products our research and development efforts or our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management moreover the growing use of social and digital media by consumers has greatly increased the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

our business is subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations including food and drug laws environmental laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws data privacy laws and anticorruption laws among others in and outside of the united states our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could affect our net operating revenues 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and potential disruption cyber attacks security problems and expanding social media vehicles present new risks 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes outside of our control such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results in addition there is a risk of business interruption violation of data privacy laws and regulations litigation and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about the company on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation in addition the disclosure of nonpublic company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

additionally we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations including the european union general data protection regulation because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements 

we rely on our management team and other key personnel 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in particular our continued success will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees if key employees terminate their employment or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations our business activities may be adversely affected and our management teams attention may be diverted in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms all of which could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

as of may 27 2018 we had a substantial amount of debt including approximately 29 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes we have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur substantial additional debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 



the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

 additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper in the event of a default the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt 

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

as of may 27 2018 we had goodwill of 45 billion  and other intangibles of 13 billion  the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as the inability to quickly replace lost comanufacturing business increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and   negatively impact our net worth 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the us and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as corn wheat and potatoes we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

the termination or expiration of current comanufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations 

our businesses periodically enter into comanufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products the terms of these agreements vary but are generally for relatively short periods of time volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the products life cycle product promotions alternative production capacity and other factors none of which are under our direct control our future ability to enter into comanufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed and a decrease in current comanufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume 

ardent mills may not achieve the benefits that are anticipated from the joint venture 

the benefits that are expected to result from our ardent mills joint venture will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated cost synergies in the transaction ardent mills ability to successfully integrate the conagra mills and horizon milling businesses and its ability to successfully manage the joint venture on a goingforward basis it is not certain that we will realize these benefits at all and if we do it is not certain how long it will take to achieve these benefits if for example we are unable to achieve the anticipated cost savings or if there are unforeseen integration costs or if ardent mills is unable to operate the joint venture smoothly in the future the financial performance of the joint venture may be negatively affected 

as we outsource certain functions we become more dependent on the third parties performing those functions 

as part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies we have entered into agreements with thirdparty service providers under which we have outsourced certain information systems sales finance accounting and other functions and we may enter into managed services agreements with respect to other functions in the future if any of these thirdparty service providers do not perform according to the terms of the agreements or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers and our reputation could be harmed depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business interruption damage or disruption of information technology systems processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property or nonpublic company sensitive information through security breaches or otherwise effects on financial reporting litigation or remediation costs or damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition if we transition functions to one or more new or among existing external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights including our trademarks licensing agreements trade secrets patents and copyrights are a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws as well as entering into licensing thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property if we fail to adequately protect the intellectual property rights we have now or may acquire in the future or if there occurs any change in law or otherwise that serves to reduce or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

certain of our intellectual property rights including the pf changs ®  bertolli ®  del monte ®  and libbys ®  trademarks are owned by third parties and licensed to us and others such as alexia ®  are owned by us and licensed to third parties while many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to the terms of such licensing arrangement if in the future we are unable to renew such a licensing arrangement pursuant to its terms and conditions or if we fail to renegotiate such a licensing arrangement then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

there is also a risk that other parties may have intellectual property rights covering some of our brands products or technology if any third parties bring a claim of intellectual property infringement against us we may be subject to costly and timeconsuming litigation diverting the attention of management and our employees if we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims we may be subject to among other things significant damages injunctions against development and sale of certain products or we may be required to enter into costly licensing agreements any of which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our spinoff of lamb weston 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 the company completed the announced spinoff of lamb weston although we believe that separating the lamb weston business from the company will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our stockholders the spinoff may not provide such results on the scope scale or timeline we anticipate and we may not realize the intended benefits of the spinoff in addition we incurred onetime costs in connection with the spinoff that may negate some of the benefits we expect to achieve if we do not realize these assumed benefits we could suffer a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition our operational and financial profile changed upon the separation of the lamb weston business from the company as a result the diversification of our revenue sources diminished and our results of operations cash flows working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility as a result 

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities or incur operational difficulties as a result of the spinoff 

the spinoff continues to involve a number of risks including among other things certain indemnification risks and risk associated with the provision of transitional services in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a trademark license agreement which we refer to as the lamb weston agreements the lamb weston agreements govern the spinoff and the relationship between the two companies going forward they also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time 

the lamb weston agreements provide for indemnification obligations designed to make lamb weston financially responsible for certain liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution including any pending or future litigation it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and lamb weston and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to lamb weston third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification we may have to bear costs temporarily in addition our indemnity obligations to lamb weston may be significant these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain of the lamb weston agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time as such there is continued risk that managements and our employees attention will be significantly diverted by the provision of transitional services the lamb weston agreements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations if lamb weston is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur losses our inability to effectively manage separation activities and related events could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the spinoff could result in substantial tax liability 

the spinoff is intended to qualify for taxfree treatment to the company and its stockholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code completion of the spinoff was conditioned upon among other things our receipt of an opinion from our tax advisors that the distribution of shares of lamb weston in the spinoff will qualify as taxfree to lamb weston the company and our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d and related provisions of the code the opinion relied on among other things various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by the company and lamb weston if such assumptions or representations are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect the conclusions reached by such advisor in its opinion could be jeopardized the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service which we refer to as the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the qualification of the spinoff as a transaction under sections 355 and 368a of the code or that any such challenge would not prevail 

if the spinoff is determined to be taxable the company and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

risks relating to our planned acquisition of pinnacle 

our planned acquisition of pinnacle may not occur at all may not occur in the expected time frame or may involve the divestiture of certain businesses which may negatively affect the trading prices of our stock and our future business and financial results 

on june 26 2018 we entered into a definitive merger agreement with pinnacle pursuant to which among other things and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of pinnacle common stock for cash and shares of conagra brands common stock as a result of the planned acquisition of pinnacle pinnacle shareholders are expected to own approximately 16 of the combined company 

completion of the planned acquisition of pinnacle is not assured and is subject to pinnacle shareholder approval and the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions including among others the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and the receipt of other required antitrust approvals 

the planned acquisition of pinnacle is subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks that the necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals will not be obtained the risk that the parties to the merger agreement may be required to divest certain businesses or assets in connection with the planned acquisition or that other closing conditions will not be satisfied for example in connection with obtaining the required regulatory approvals the company andor pinnacle may be required to divest assets of their respective businesses  subject to certain limitations set forth in the merger agreement including that the company shall not be required to divest any assets or business of the company or pinnacle that in the aggregate generated net sales in excess of 3000 million during the most recently completed fiscal year if the planned acquisition of pinnacle is not completed if there are significant delays in completing the planned acquisition or if the planned acquisition involves the divestiture of certain businesses it could negatively affect the trading prices of our common stock and our future business and financial results and could result in our failure to realize certain synergies relating to such acquisition 

our obligation to complete the planned acquisition of pinnacle is not subject to a financing condition  and we may be required to finance a portion of the purchase price at interest rates higher than currently expected 

our obligation to complete the planned acquisition of pinnacle is not subject to a financing condition we have obtained committed financing from goldman sachs bank usa and goldman sachs lending partners llc and expect to obtain permanent financing for the planned acquisition by accessing the capital markets which may include the issuance of longterm debt and equity if any of the banks in the committed financing facilities are unable to perform their commitments we may be required to finance a portion of the purchase price of the planned acquisition at interest rates higher than currently expected 

we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the planned acquisition of pinnacle 

the benefits that are expected to result from the planned acquisition of pinnacle will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and 215 million in cost synergies as a result of the planned acquisition our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on whether the company or pinnacle are required to divest assets of their respective business and on the successful integration of pinnacle there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as pinnacle the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in our and pinnacles activities members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer there can be no assurance that we will successfully or costeffectively integrate pinnacle the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we are able to integrate pinnacle successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all for example we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs moreover we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of pinnacle while it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the planned acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to or delays in integrating the businesses 

we will incur a substantial amount of debt to complete the planned acquisition of pinnacle to service our debt we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs if we cannot generate the required cash we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness 

at may 27 2018 we had total debt of approximately 38 billion we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and we plan to incur significant additional indebtedness if we complete the planned acquisition of pinnacle in connection with the acquisition we expect to incur up to 83 billion of longterm debt including for the payment of the cash portion of the merger consideration the repayment of pinnacle debt the refinancing of certain conagra debt and the payment of related fees and expenses our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate that our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures 

the degree to which we are currently leveraged and will be leveraged following the completion of the planned acquisition could have important consequences for shareholders for example it could 

 additionally any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on us 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us

 item 3 legal proceedings 

litigation matters 

we are a party to certain litigation matters relating to our acquisition of beatrice company beatrice in fiscal 1991 including litigation proceedings related to businesses divested by beatrice prior to our acquisition of the company these proceedings include suits against a number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers including conagra grocery products company llc a wholly owned subsidiary of the company conagra grocery products as alleged successor to w p fuller  co a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by a predecessor to beatrice from 1962 until 1967 these lawsuits generally seek damages for personal injury property damage economic loss and governmental expenditures allegedly caused by the use of leadbased paint andor injunctive relief for inspection and abatement although decisions favorable to us have been rendered in rhode island new jersey wisconsin and ohio we remain a defendant in active suits in illinois and california conagra grocery products has denied liability in both suits both on the merits of the claims and on the basis that we do not believe it to be the successor to any liability attributable to w p fuller  co the california suit is discussed in the following paragraph the illinois suit seeks classwide relief for reimbursement of costs associated with the testing of lead levels in blood we do not believe it is probable that we have incurred any liability with respect to the illinois case nor is it possible to estimate any potential exposure 

in california a number of cities and counties joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of an alleged public nuisance in the form of leadbased paint potentially present on the interior of residences regardless of its condition on september 23 2013 a trial of the california case concluded in the superior court of california for the county of santa clara and on january 27 2014 the court entered a judgment the judgment against conagra grocery products and two  other defendants ordering the creation of a california abatement fund in the amount of 115 billion  liability is joint and several the company appealed the judgment and on november 14 2017 the california court of appeal for the sixth appellate district reversed in part holding that the defendants were not liable to pay for abatement of homes built after 1950 but affirmed the judgment as to homes built before 1951 the court of appeal remanded the case to the trial court with directions to recalculate the amount of the abatement fund estimated to be necessary to cover the cost of remediating pre1951 homes and to hold an evidentiary hearing regarding appointment of a suitable receiver conagra grocery products and the other defendants petitioned the california supreme court for review of the decision which we believe to be an unprecedented expansion of current california law on february 14 2018 the california supreme court denied the petition and declined to review the merits of the case and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings conagra grocery products and the other defendants have indicated that they will seek further review of certain issues from the supreme court of the 

united states although further appeal is discretionary and may not be granted further proceedings in the trial court may not be stayed pending the outcome of any further appeal in light of the decision rendered by the california appellate court on november 14 2017 and the california supreme courts decision on february 14 2018 not to review the appellate courts decision we have concluded that the liability has likely become probable as contemplated by accounting standards codification topic 450 however many uncertainties remain which make it difficult to estimate the potential liability including the following i the trial court has not yet recalculated its estimate of the amount needed to remediate pre1951 homes in the plaintiff jurisdictions or entered a new judgment to replace the one vacated by the california appellate court ii although liability is joint and several it is unknown what amount each defendant may ultimately be required to pay or how allocation among the defendants and other potentially responsible parties such as property owners who may have violated the applicable housing codes will be determined iii according to the trial courts original order participation in the abatement program by eligible homeowners is voluntary and it is unknown what percentage of eligible homeowners will choose to participate or how such claims will be administered iv the trial courts original order required that any amounts paid by the defendants into the fund that were not spent within four years would be returned to the defendants and it is unknown whether this feature of the fund will be retained or if it is retained how much will be spent during that time period and v defendants will have a new right to appeal any new aspects of the judgment entered by the trial court upon remand although it is unknown whether the court would stay execution of any new judgment while a subsequent appeal is pending 

to assist the trial court in satisfying its responsibilities during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the defendants and plaintiff each submitted information to the court regarding recalculation of the abatement fund in addition one of the defendants entered into a proposed settlement with the plaintiff contingent upon a judicial good faith determination under california law we are uncertain as to when the court will make a ruling on a recalculated abatement fund or the proposed settlement notwithstanding the uncertainties described above this additional information was used by the company in concluding that a loss is now reasonably estimable while the ultimate amount of any loss and timing of payments related thereto remain uncertain and could change as further information is obtained we believe that our share of the loss could range from 60 million  to 335 million  and have recorded a liability for the amount in that range that we believe is a better estimate than the low or high ends of the range the extent of insurance coverage is uncertain and the companys carriers are on notice however any possible insurance recovery has not been considered for purposes of determining our liability the company cannot assure that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

in june 2009 an accidental explosion occurred at our manufacturing facility in garner north carolina this facility was the primary production facility for our slim jim ®  branded meat snacks in june 2009 the us bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives announced its determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental natural gas release and not a deliberate act during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we settled our property and business interruption claims related to the garner accident with our insurance providers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 jacobs engineering group inc jacobs our engineer and project manager at the site filed a declaratory judgment action against us seeking indemnity for personal injury claims brought against it as a result of the accident during the first quarter of fiscal 2012 our motion for summary judgment was granted and the suit was dismissed without prejudice on the basis that the suit was filed prematurely in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 jacobs refiled its action seeking indemnity on march 25 2016 a douglas county jury in nebraska rendered a verdict in favor of jacobs and against us in the amount of 1089 million  plus postjudgment interest we filed our notice of appeal in september 2016 the appeal was heard by the nebraska supreme court in november 2017 and the case is awaiting decision by the nebraska supreme court the appeal will be decided directly by the nebraska supreme court although our insurance carriers have provided customary notices of reservation of their rights under the policies of insurance we expect any ultimate exposure in this case to be limited to the applicable insurance deductible 

we are party to a number of putative class action lawsuits challenging various product claims made in the companys product labeling these matters include briseno v conagra foods inc in which it is alleged that the labeling for wesson ®  oils as 100 natural is false and misleading because the oils contain genetically modified plants and organisms in february 2015 the us district court for the central district of california granted class certification to permit plaintiffs to pursue state law claims the company appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit which affirmed class certification in january 2017 the supreme court of the united states declined to review the decision and the case has been remanded to the trial court for further proceedings while we cannot predict with certainty the results of this or any other legal proceeding we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or business 

we are party to matters challenging the companys wage and hour practices these matters include a number of putative class actions consolidated under the caption negrete v conagra foods inc et al pending in the us district court for the central district of california in which the plaintiffs allege a pattern of violations of california andor federal law at several 

current and former company manufacturing facilities across the state of california while we cannot predict with certainty the results of this or any other legal proceeding we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or business 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we accrued 1510 million  in new legal reserves relating to the matters set forth above 

environmental matters 

we are a party to certain environmental proceedings relating to our acquisition of beatrice in fiscal 1991 such proceedings include proceedings related to businesses divested by beatrice prior to our acquisition of beatrice the current environmental proceedings associated with beatrice include litigation and administrative proceedings involving beatrices possible status as a potentially responsible party at approximately 40 superfund proposed superfund or stateequivalent sites the beatrice sites these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of beatrice that used or produced petroleum pesticides fertilizers dyes inks solvents pcbs acids lead sulfur tannery wastes andor other contaminants in the past five years beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 31 of these sites reserves for these beatrice environmental proceedings have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup the known volumetric contribution of beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites the accrual for beatricerelated environmental matters totaled 524 million as of may 27 2018 a majority of which relates to the superfund and stateequivalent sites referenced above during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 a final remedial investigationfeasibility study was submitted for the southwest properties portion of the wells gh superfund site which is one of the beatrice sites the us environmental protection agency the epa issued a record of decision the rod for the southwest properties portion of the site on september 29 2017 and has entered into negotiations with potentially responsible parties to determine final responsibility for implementing the rod 

general matters 

after taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing matters management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however it is reasonably possible that a change of the estimates of any of the foregoing matters may occur in the future and as noted the lead paint matter could result in a material final judgment

presentation of derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results 

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings in the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately 

the following table presents the net derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions associated with continuing operations under this methodology 



as of may 27 2018  the cumulative amount of net derivative gains from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was 32 million  all of which was incurred during the fiscal year ended may 27 2018  based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify to segment operating results gains of 25 million  in fiscal 2019  and 07 million  in fiscal 2020  and thereafter

interest expense net 

in fiscal 2017  net interest expense was  1955 million  a decrease of  1003 million  or 34  from fiscal 2016  the decrease reflects the repayment of 215 billion 550 million and 473 million of debt in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and the third quarter of fiscal 2017 respectively as well as the exchange of 144 billion of debt in connection with the spinoff of lamb weston during the second quarter of 2017

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity and capital 

the primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives if necessary we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories less accounts payable accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets we are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating 

at may 27 2018  we had a revolving credit facility the facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that provides for a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of 125 billion subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 175 billion with the consent of the lenders we have historically used a credit facility principally as a backup for our commercial paper program as of may 27 2018  there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility on july 11 2018 subsequent to our fiscal year end we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of 16 billion subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 21 billion it replaces the existing facility and generally requires our ratio of ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense to be not less than 30 to 10 and our ratio of funded debt to ebitda to not exceed certain specified levels with each ratio to be calculated on a rolling fourquarter basis 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we repaid the remaining principal balance of 700 million of our 21 senior notes on the maturity date of march 15 2018 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we entered into a term loan agreement the term loan agreement with a financial institution the term loan agreement provides for term loans to the company in an aggregate principal amount not in excess of 3000 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we borrowed the full amount of the 3000 million provided for under the term loan agreement the proceeds from this borrowing were used to make a voluntary pension plan contribution in the amount of 3000 million the term loan agreement matures on february 26 2019 the term loan bears interest at a rate equal to threemonth libor plus 075 per annum and is fully prepayable without penalty 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we repaid the remaining principal balance of 1196 million of our 19 senior notes on the maturity date of january 25 2018 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we repaid the remaining capital lease liability balance of 285 million in connection with the early exit of an unfavorable lease contract 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due october 9 2020 the notes bear interest at a rate equal to threemonth libor plus 050 per annum 

as of may 27 2018  we had 2770 million  outstanding under our commercial paper program the highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2018  was 4697 million  a s of may 28 2017 we had 262 million  outstanding under our commercial paper program 

as of the end of fiscal 2018  our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult 

the company has secured 90 billion in fully committed bridge financing from affiliates of goldman sachs group inc in connection with the merger the commitments under the committed bridge financing were subsequently reduced by the amounts of a term loan agreement we entered into on july 11 2018 with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for term loans to us in an aggregate principal amount of up to 13 billion the funding under the term loan agreement is anticipated to occur simultaneously with the closing date of the acquisition in connection with the merger we expect to incur up to 83 billion of longterm debt which includes any funding under the new term loan agreement including for the payment of the cash portion of the merger consideration the repayment of pinnacle debt the refinancing of certain conagra debt and the payment of related fees and expenses the permanent financing is also expected to include approximately 600 million of incremental cash proceeds from the issuance of equity andor divestitures 

we repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board of directors the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date under the share repurchase authorization we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years depending on market conditions and other factors and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions during fiscal 2018 we repurchased 274 million shares of our common stock under this authorization for an aggregate of 9673 million  in may 2018 our board of directors approved an additional 10 billion of share repurchases the companys total remaining share repurchase authorization as of may 27 2018  was 141 billion  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we suspended share repurchase activity in light of the pending acquisition of pinnacle the company plans to repurchase shares under its authorized program only at times and in amounts as is consistent with the prioritization of achieving its leverage targets 

on april 20 2018 the board of directors authorized a quarterly dividend payment of 02125 per share which was paid on may 31 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on april 30 2018 subject to market and other conditions and the approval of our board of directors we intend to maintain our quarterly dividend at the current annual rate of 085 per share during fiscal 2019 in the future we expect modest dividend increases while we focus on deleveraging subject to the approval of our board of directors 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we entered into an agreement to sell our del monte ®  processed fruit and vegetable business in canada to bonduelle group the transaction was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and was valued at approximately 430 million canadian dollars which was approximately 340 million us dollars at the exchange rate on the date of announcement 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we signed an agreement to sell our wesson ®  oil business to smucker for 285 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 conagra brands and smucker terminated the agreement this outcome followed the decision of the federal trade commission announced on march 5 2018 to challenge the pending transaction the company is still actively marketing the wesson ®  oil business and expects to sell it within the next twelve months 

we have access to the 125 billion facility our commercial paper program and the capital markets we believe we also have access to additional bank loan facilities if needed 

we expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration as well as to either retire or refinance senior debt upon maturity as market conditions warrant from operating cash flows our commercial paper program proceeds from any divestitures and other disposition transactions access to capital markets and our 125 billion facility 

cash flows 

in fiscal 2018  we used 1234 million  of cash which was the net result of 9542 million  generated from operating activities 5762 million  used in investing activities 5069 million  used in financing activities and an increase of  55 million  due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled  9197 million  in fiscal 2018  as compared to  114 billion  generated in fiscal 2017  the decrease in operating cash flows was primarily the net result of increased pension plan payments and changes in working capital offset by reduced income tax and interest payments pension plan payments mainly consisted of voluntary contributions totaling 3000 million and 1500 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively yearoveryear increases in receivables higher inventory build and payments made to terminate an unfavorable operating lease negatively impacted operating cash flows for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 income tax payment reductions were driven by the impact of corporate tax rate reductions resulting from the tax act signed into law during the third quarter of 

fiscal 2018 significant debt repayments during fiscal 2017 contributed to decreased interest payments in fiscal 2018 payments related to incentive compensation and our restructuring plans were also reduced for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was 345 million  and 347 million  in fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  respectively this primarily reflects the activities of the lamb weston business that was spun off on november 9 2016 and to a lesser extent other divested businesses operating cash flows of discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 were also impacted by expenses related to the spinoff 

cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled 5762 million  in fiscal 2018  compared to 656 million  in fiscal 2017  investing activities of continuing operations of fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 2516 million  and the purchases of the sandwich bros of wisconsin ®   business and angies artisan treats llc for a total of 3371 million  net of cash acquired investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2017 included the proceeds from the divestitures of the spicetec and jm swank businesses totaling 4890 million  in the aggregate partially offset by capital expenditures of 2421 million  and acquisitions totaling 3257 million  including the operating assets of frontera foods inc and red fork llc and the proteinbased snacking businesses thanasi foods llc and bigs llc 

cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from capital expenditures 

cash used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled 5069 million  in fiscal 2018  compared to 241 billion  in fiscal 2017  financing activities of continuing operations for fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of common stock repurchases of 9673 million  net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 7970 million  cash dividend payments of 3423 million  longterm debt repayments totaling 2423 million  and net shortterm borrowings of 2491 million  cash used in financing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2017 reflected debt repayments of 106 billion  common stock repurchases totaling 10 billion  and dividends paid of 4150 million  partially offset by employee stock option exercises and the issuance of other stock awards of 738 million  

cash provided by financing activities of discontinued operations principally comprises borrowings by lamb weston which were transferred in connection with the spinoff 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of 1280 million  at may 27 2018  and 2514 million  at may 28 2017  of which 1216 million at may 27 2018  and 2449 million at may 28 2017  was held in foreign countries during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 the company repatriated 1513 million  of cash balances previously deemed to be permanently reinvested outside the us refer to note 15  pretax income and income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for more information related to this repatriation of cash and related adjustments to deferred tax liability as well as the impacts of the tax act on remaining unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 

our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2019  is approximately 350 million excluding any incremental amounts resulting from the pending acquisition of pinnacle 

management believes that the companys sources of liquidity will be adequate finance the cash portion of the merger consideration to satisfy working capital needs repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time make payments of anticipated quarterly dividends complete planned capital expenditures and make any required debt repayments including by retiring or refinancing senior debt upon maturity as market conditions warrant for the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use offbalance sheet arrangements eg leases accounted for as operating leases where sound business principles warrant their use we also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business these are described further in obligations and commitments    below 

variable interest entities not consolidated 

we lease or leased certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities the lease agreements with these entities include fixedprice purchase options for the assets being leased the lease agreements also contain contingent put options the lease put options that allow or allowed the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost or fair market value without a lease agreement in place the put price in certain limited circumstances as a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested private brands operations these 

lease put options became exercisable during fiscal 2016 we entered into a series of related transactions in which we exchanged a warehouse we owned in indiana for two buildings and parcels of land that we leased as part of our omaha corporate offices concurrent with the asset exchange the leases on the two omaha corporate buildings which were subject to contingent put options were canceled we recognized aggregate charges of 556 million for the early termination of these leases we also entered into a lease for the warehouse in indiana and we recorded a financing lease obligation of 742 million during fiscal 2017 one of these lease agreements expired as a result of this expiration we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of 67 million in sga expenses during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we purchased two buildings that were subject to lease put options and recognized net losses totaling 482 million for the early exit of unfavorable lease contracts 

as of may 27 2018  there was one remaining leased building subject to a lease put option for which the put option price exceeded the estimated fair value of the property by 82 million of which we had accrued 12 million we are amortizing the difference between the put price and the estimated fair value without a lease agreement in place of the property over the remaining lease term within sga expenses this lease is accounted for as an operating lease and accordingly there are no material assets and liabilities other than the accrued portion of the put price associated with this entity included in the consolidated balance sheets we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this entity in making this determination we have considered among other items the terms of the lease agreement the expected remaining useful life of the asset leased and the capital structure of the lessor entity 

obligations and commitments 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements debt agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as takeorpay contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available of these items debt notes payable and capital lease obligations which totaled 380 billion as of may 27 2018  were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations which totaled 126 billion as of may 27 2018  were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of may 27 2018  was as follows 



1  amount includes open purchase orders and agreements some of which are not legally binding andor may be cancellable such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year 

we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our longterm debt and capital lease obligations the weightedaverage coupon interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 27 2018  was approximately 49 

the operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by noncancellable sublease rentals of 05 million 

as of may 27 2018  we had aggregate unfunded pension obligations totaling 685 million  this amount is not included in the table above in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we made a voluntary pension plan contribution in the amount of 3000 million we do not expect to be required to make additional payments to fund these amounts in the foreseeable future based on current statutory requirements we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next 

twelve months we estimate that we will make payments of approximately 196 million  over the next twelve months to fund our pension plans see note 19  pension and postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements and  critical accounting estimates  employment related benefits  contained in this report for further discussion of our pension obligations and factors that could affect estimates of this liability 

as part of our ongoing operations we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event eg guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform in accordance with us gaap the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets a summary of our commitments including commitments associated with equity method investments as of may 27 2018  was as follows 



in addition to the commitments included in the table above as of may 27 2018 we had 324 million of standby letters of credit issued on our behalf these standby letters of credit are primarily related to our selfinsured workers compensation programs and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

in certain limited situations we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity we guarantee certain leases resulting from the divestiture of the jm swank business completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as of may 27 2018  the remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed five years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was 26 million in addition we guarantee a certain lease resulting from an exited facility as of may 27 2018  the remaining term of this arrangement does not exceed nine years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was 217 million 

in certain limited situations we also guarantee obligations of the lamb weston business pursuant to guarantee arrangements that existed prior to the spinoff and remained in place following completion of the spinoff until such guarantee obligations are substituted for guarantees issued by lamb weston such guarantee arrangements are described below pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement dated as of november 8 2016 the separation agreement between us and lamb weston these guarantee arrangements are deemed liabilities of lamb weston that were transferred to lamb weston as part of the spinoff accordingly in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of these guarantee arrangements lamb weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us in accordance with the terms of the indemnification provisions under the separation agreement 

lamb weston is a party to a warehouse services agreement with a thirdparty warehouse provider through july 2035 under this agreement lamb weston is required to make payments for warehouse services based on the quantity of goods stored and other service factors we have guaranteed the warehouse provider that we will make the payments required under the agreement in the event that lamb weston fails to perform minimum payments of 15 million  per month are required under this agreement it is not possible to determine the maximum amount of the payment obligations under this agreement upon completion of the spinoff we recognized a liability for the estimated fair value of this guarantee as of may 27 2018  the amount of this guarantee recorded in other noncurrent liabilities was 281 million  

lamb weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a third party for certain farmland through 2020 subject at lamb westons option to extension for two additional fiveyear periods under the terms of the sublease agreement lamb weston is required to make certain rental payments to the sublessor we have guaranteed lamb westons performance and the payment of all amounts including indemnification obligations owed by lamb weston under the sublease agreement up to a maximum of 750 million  we believe the farmland associated with this sublease agreement is readily marketable for lease to other area farming operators as such we believe that any financial exposure to the company in the event that we were required to perform under the guaranty would be largely mitigated 

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 27 2018  was 325 million  the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 27 

2018  that if recognized would favorably impact our effective tax rate was 278 million  recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management 

our auditfinance committee has reviewed managements development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

marketing costs —we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs which include advertising customer incentives and consumer incentives we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with us gaap the judgment required in determining marketing costs can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to customers management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change managements estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

we have recognized reserves of 1005 million  for these marketing costs as of may 27 2018  changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program   including amounts classified as a revenue reduction would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows 

advertising and promotion expenses totaled 2786 million  3283 million  and 3472 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our consolidated balance sheets as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 15 pretax income and income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup managements estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash 

payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately  578 million  for environmental liabilities as of may 27 2018  the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy 

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers compensation in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 

beginning in fiscal 2017 the company has elected to use a split discount rate the spotrate approach for the us plans and certain foreign plans historically a single weightedaverage discount rate was used in the calculation of service and interest costs both of which are components of pension benefit costs the spotrate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost this change is considered a change in accounting estimate and has been applied prospectively the pretax reduction in total pension benefit cost associated with this change in fiscal 2017 was approximately 270 million  

we have recognized a pension liability of  1715 million  and  5822 million  a postretirement liability of  1182 million  and  1569 million  and a workers compensation liability of  394 million  and  415 million  as of the end of fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively we also have recognized a pension asset of  1030 million  and  171 million  as of the end of fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status 

we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation the corridor in current period expense annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when measurement is required otherwise under us gaap 

we recognized pension expense benefit including activities of discontinued operations from company plans of  561 million   129 million  and  3708 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively such amounts reflect the yearend   writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability of 34 million 12 million and 3485 million in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of  2183 million   2074 million  and  2599 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we contributed  3126 million   1630 million  and  115 million  to the pension plans of our continuing operations in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  196 million  to our pension plans in fiscal 2019 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate historically we have selected a discount rate each year as of our fiscal yearend measurement date for our plans based upon a highquality corporate bond yield curve for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans the corporate bond yield curve is comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moodys aa available at the measurement date at may 29 2016 the company changed to use a spotrate approach discussed above this alternative approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a highquality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate approach 

based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 390  for fiscal 2018  383  for fiscal 2017  and 410  for fiscal 2016  we selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 421  and 383  for determination of service and interest expense respectively for fiscal 2019  a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2018  would have resulted in an increase of  39 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2018  a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2018  would have resulted in an decrease of  30 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2018  for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected discount rates of 414  and 390  for fiscal years 2018  and 2017  respectively 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plans investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 750  for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2018  pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by  73 million  

during fiscal 2018 we approved an amendment of our salaried and nonqualified pension plans the amendment froze the compensation and service periods used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in those plans as a result of this amendment we have changed our salaried and nonqualified pension asset investment strategy to align our related pension plan assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility we selected a weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets of 517  to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2019  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2019  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by  82 million  

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans due to the amendment discussed above this assumption is no longer applicable for any of our pension plans in fiscal 2019 and thereafter we selected 363  for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal year 2018  366  for fiscal 2017  and 370  for fiscal 2016  a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018  would increase pension expense for our pension plans by  05 million  for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018  would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by  05 million  for the year 

in october 2016 the society of actuaries retirement plan experience committee published updated mortality improvement scales and recommended their use with base mortality tables for the measurement of us pension plan obligations with the assistance of our thirdparty actuary in measuring our pension obligations as of may 28 2017 we incorporated a revised improvement scale to be used with our current base mortality tables that generally reflect the mortality improvement inherent in these new tables 

 during 2018 we conducted a mortality experience study and with the assistance of our thirdparty actuary adopted new companyspecific mortality tables used in measuring our pension obligations as of may 27 2018 in addition we incorporated a revised mortality improvement scale to be used with the new companyspecific mortality tables that reflects the mortality improvement inherent in these tables 

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense benefit of  07 million   12 million  and  02 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we reflected liabilities of  1182 million  and  1569 million  in our balance sheets as of may 27 2018  and may 28 2017  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  162 million  to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2019  

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates also discussed above and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 333  for fiscal 2018  318  for fiscal 2017  and 350  for fiscal 2016  we have selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 381  for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2019  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 787 with the trend rate decreasing to 45 by 2024 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 



we provide workers compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the weightedaverage discount rate used at may 27 2018  was 288 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense or the liability 

business combinations impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets and goodwill —we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets including property plant and equipment to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable we generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group no impairment is recognized if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group we writedown the asset or assets to their estimated fair values the estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group 

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands while other acquired intangible assets eg customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of definitelived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience the competitive and macroeconomic environment and our operating plans the costs of definitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 

we reduce the carrying amounts of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets 

in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

if we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks we utilize a relief from royalty methodology the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 

estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

in testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

under the quantitative impairment test the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a riskadjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period typically four or five years and the terminal period considering expected long term growth rates and trends estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in riskadjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit 

prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value we completed a second step of the test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss if any to be recognized in the second step we estimated an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the impairment loss was equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill as a result of adopting accounting standards update asu 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 in anticipation of the spinoff we changed our reporting segments in accordance with applicable accounting guidance we were required to determine new reporting units at a lower level at the operating segment or one level lower as applicable when such a determination was made we were required to perform a goodwill impairment analysis for each of the old and new reporting units 

we performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new canadian reporting unit within the new international reporting segment estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions we estimated the future cash flows of the canadian reporting unit and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate in order to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 75 and 2 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill we recognized an impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill accordingly 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded charges totaling 1392 million for the impairment of goodwill the remaining goodwill balance of the canadian reporting unit as of may 27 2018 was 376 million 

as part of the assessment of the fair value of each asset and liability within the canadian reporting unit with the assistance of the thirdparty valuation specialist we estimated the fair value of a canadian brand to be less than its carrying value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance we recognized an impairment charge of 244 million to write down the intangible asset to its estimated fair value 

we also performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new mexican reporting unit within the international reporting segment using similar methods to those described above we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 85 and 3 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we determined that the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately 5 accordingly we did not recognize an impairment of the goodwill in the mexican reporting unit 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits primarily due to foreign exchange rates we performed an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new mexican reporting unit we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 85 and 3 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill we recognized an impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill accordingly during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded charges totaling 439 million for the impairment of goodwill 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 in conjunction with our annual impairment testing we adopted asu 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment as a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits we performed an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new mexican reporting unit we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 90 and 30 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit we recognized an impairment charge of 158 million  equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit the remaining goodwill balance of the mexican reporting unit as of may 27 2018 was 1185 million 

in fiscal 2018 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles during fiscal 2018 we recognized impairment charges of 40 million  for our hk anderson ®  red fork ®  and salpica ®  brands in our grocery  snacks segment we also recognized an impairment charge of 08 million  for our aylmer ®  brand in our international segment 

in fiscal 2017 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles during fiscal 2017 we recognized impairment charges of 71 million  for our del monte ®   brand and 55 million  for our aylmer ®  brand in our international segment we also recognized impairment charges of 671 million  for our chef boyardee ®  brand and 11 million  for our fiddle faddle ®  brand in our grocery  snacks segment 

in fiscal 2016 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles during fiscal 2016 we recognized impairment charges of 501 million in our grocery  snacks segment for our chef boyardee ®  brand 

we completed the divestiture of our private brands operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 in fiscal 2016 we recognized charges of 192 billion   144 billion  aftertax to writedown the goodwill and longlived assets of the private brands business

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2018  and 2017  were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies 

commodity market risk 

we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products nuts sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions 

interest rate risk 

we may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt 

as of may 27 2018  and may 28 2017  the fair value of our longterm debt including current installments was estimated at 376 billion  and 332 billion  respectively based on current market rates as of may 27 2018  and may 28 2017  a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1681 million and 1978 million respectively while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1857 million and 2194 million respectively 

foreign currency risk 

in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 

valueatrisk var 

we employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk including valueatrisk var models we perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions we use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of var that is used to monitor our daily risk the purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices our model uses a 95 confidence level accordingly in any given one day time period losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5 of the time we include commodity swaps futures and options and foreign exchange forwards swaps and options in this calculation the following table provides an overview of our average daily var for our energy agriculture and foreign exchange positions including discontinued operations for fiscal 2018  and 2017

general 

the following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments 

conagra brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded private branded and valueadded consumer food as well as foodservice items and ingredients we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources from time to time we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption 

we experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets our food items compete with widely advertised wellknown branded food as well as private branded and customized food items some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related food items are sold some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

many of our facilities and products we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects 

and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 24  23  and 20  of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

at may 28 2017  conagra brands and its subsidiaries had approximately 12600  employees primarily in the united states approximately 47  of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 6  are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during fiscal 2018  we believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good 

research and development 

we employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition we conduct research activities related to the development of new products research and development expense was 446 million  596 million  and 631 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

risks relating to our business 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

 increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

the food industry is highly competitive and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases we sell branded private brand and customized food products as well as commercially branded foods our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors in addition when branded competitors focus on price and promotion the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material packaging and energy costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume reduced margins and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains wheat corn and oats oils beef pork poultry and energy changes in the values of these derivatives are generally recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations and in unallocated general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our supply chain and administrative efficiency plan or scae plan 

in may 2013 we announced the supply chain and administrative efficiency plan the scae plan our plan to integrate and restructure the operations of our private brands business improve selling general and administrative sga effectiveness and efficiencies and optimize our supply chain network manufacturing assets dry distribution centers and mixing centers in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we announced plans to realize efficiency benefits by reducing sga expenses and enhancing trade spend processes and tools which plans were included in the scae plan although we divested the private brands business we have continued to implement the scae plan including by working to optimize our supply chain network pursue cost reductions through our sga functions enhance trade spend processes and tools and improve productivity 

the successful design and implementation of the scae plan presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the scae plan may not advance our business strategy as expected events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the scae plan our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the scae plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the complexity of the scae plan will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the scae plan these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from existing core businesses integrating financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration and other national state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act the fdca and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us 

during fiscal 2017 our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 24  of our net revenues there can be no assurance that walmart stores inc and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have continued to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business these consolidations the growth of supercenters and the growth of online customers have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their store brand products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label or store brand competition our profitability could decline 

consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

if we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers any of these factors could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

in fiscal 2017 we completed the frontera acquisition which included the frontera ®  red fork ®  and salpica ®  brands for 1081 million in cash net of cash acquired and the thanasi acquisition which included the duke’s ®  meat snacks and bigs ®  seeds brands for 2176 million in cash net of cash acquired subject to a working capital adjustment 

if we are unable to complete our proposed divestitures our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability and margins moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems possible need for providing transition services to buyers adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

in fiscal 2017 we completed the divestitures of two smaller noncore businesses spicetec flavors  seasonings and jm swank for combined proceeds of 4890 million as well as the separation of conagra foods inc into conagra brands and lamb weston through the spinoff of lamb weston we also announced a definitive agreement with the jm smucker company to divest the wesson ®  oil business subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of regulatory approvals 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes government action or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities the failure to achieve our goals with respect to sodium or saturated fat our research and development efforts or our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

our business is subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations including food and drug laws environmental laws laws related to advertising and marketing practices accounting standards taxation requirements competition laws employment laws and anticorruption laws among others in and outside of the united states our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could affect our net operating revenues 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and potential disruption cyber attacks security problems and expanding social media vehicles present new risks 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results in addition there is a risk of business interruption litigation risks and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about the company on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation in addition 

the disclosure of nonpublic company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we rely on our management team and other key personnel 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in particular our continued success will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees if key employees terminate their employment or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations our business activities may be adversely affected and our management teams attention may be diverted in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms all of which could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

as of may 28 2017 we had a substantial amount of debt including 26 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes we have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur substantial additional debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 

 additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper in the event of a default the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt 

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

as of may 28 2017 we had goodwill of 43 billion  and other intangibles of 12 billion  the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as the inability to quickly replace lost comanufacturing business increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry ebitda multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and   negatively impact our net worth 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the us and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as corn wheat and potatoes we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

the termination or expiration of current comanufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations 

our businesses periodically enter into comanufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products the terms of these agreements vary but are generally for relatively short periods of time volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the products life cycle product promotions alternative production capacity and other factors none of which are under our direct control our future ability to enter into comanufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed and a decrease in current comanufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume 

ardent mills may not achieve the benefits that are anticipated from the joint venture 

the benefits that are expected to result from our ardent mills joint venture will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated cost synergies in the transaction ardent mills ability to successfully integrate the conagra mills and horizon milling businesses and its ability to successfully manage the joint venture on a goingforward basis it is not certain that we will realize these benefits at all and if we do it is not certain how long it will take to achieve these benefits if for example we are unable to achieve the anticipated cost savings or if there are unforeseen integration costs or if ardent mills is unable to operate the joint venture smoothly in the future the financial performance of the joint venture may be negatively affected 

actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs divert managements attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions if activist stockholder activities ensue our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees for example we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters including legal financial and communications advisors the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors customers employee and joint venture partners and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation 

risks relating to our recently completed spinoff of lamb weston 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 the company completed the announced spinoff of lamb weston although we believe that separating the lamb weston business from the company will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our stockholders the spinoff may not provide such results on the scope scale or timeline we anticipate and we may not realize the intended benefits of the spinoff in addition we incurred onetime costs in connection with the spinoff that may negate some of the benefits we expect to achieve if we do not realize these assumed benefits we could suffer a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition our operational and financial profile changed upon the separation of the lamb weston business from the company as a result the diversification of our revenue sources diminished and our results of operations cash flows working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility as a result 

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities or incur operational difficulties as a result of the spinoff 

the spinoff continues to involve a number of risks including among other things certain indemnification risks and risk associated with the provision of transitional services in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a trademark license agreement which we refer to as the lamb weston agreements the lamb weston agreements govern the spinoff and the relationship between the two companies going forward they also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time 

the lamb weston agreements provides for indemnification obligations designed to make lamb weston financially responsible for certain liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution including any pending or future litigation it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and lamb weston and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to lamb weston third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification we may have to bear costs temporarily in addition our indemnity obligations to lamb weston may be significant these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition certain of the lamb weston agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time as such there is continued risk that managements and our employees attention will be significantly diverted by the provision of transitional services the lamb weston agreements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations if lamb weston is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could 

incur losses our inability to effectively manage separation activities and related events could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the spinoff could result in substantial tax liability 

the spinoff is intended to qualify for taxfree treatment to the company and its stockholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code completion of the spinoff was conditioned upon among other things our receipt of an opinion from our tax advisors that the distribution of shares of lamb weston in the spinoff will qualify as taxfree to lamb weston the company and our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d and related provisions of the code the opinion relied on among other things various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by the company and lamb weston if such assumptions or representations are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect the conclusions reached by such advisor in its opinion could be jeopardized the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service which we refer to as the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the qualification of the spinoff as a transaction under sections 355 and 368a of the code or that any such challenge would not prevail 

if the spinoff is determined to be taxable the company and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

 item 2 properties 

our headquarters are located in chicago illinois general offices are also located in omaha nebraska as well as certain shared service centers including a product development facility enterprise business services center and an information technology center we also lease a limited number of domestic sales offices international general offices are located in canada china columbia mexico and panama 

we maintain a number of standalone distribution facilities in addition there are warehouses at most of our manufacturing facilities 

utilization of manufacturing capacity varies by manufacturing plant based upon the type of products assigned and the level of demand for those products management believes that our manufacturing and processing plants are well maintained and are generally adequate to support the current operations of the business 

as of july 21   2017  we have thirty domestic manufacturing facilities located in arkansas california georgia indiana illinois iowa kentucky michigan minnesota missouri nebraska new hampshire ohio pennsylvania tennessee washington and wisconsin we also have international manufacturing facilities in canada italy and mexico and interests in ownership of international manufacturing facilities in india mexico and the philippines 

we own most of the manufacturing facilities however a limited number of plants and parcels of land with the related manufacturing equipment are leased substantially all of our transportation equipment and forwardpositioned distribution centers containing finished goods are leased or operated by third parties 

the majority of our manufacturing assets are shared across multiple reporting segments output from these facilities used by each reporting segment can change over time therefore it is impracticable to disclose them by segment 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a party to various environmental proceedings and litigation primarily related to our acquisition of beatrice company beatrice in fiscal 1991 as a result of the acquisition of beatrice and the significant preacquisition contingencies of the beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries our condensed consolidated postacquisition financial statements reflect liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies such liabilities include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by beatrice prior to our acquisition of beatrice the litigation proceedings include suits against a number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers including conagra grocery products 

company llc a wholly owned subsidiary of the company conagra grocery products and the company as alleged successors to w p fuller co a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by beatrice until 1967 although decisions favorable to us have been rendered in rhode island new jersey wisconsin and ohio we remain a defendant in active suits in illinois and california the illinois suit seeks classwide relief for reimbursement of costs associated with the testing of lead levels in blood in california a number of cities and counties joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the alleged public nuisance on september 23 2013 a trial of the california case concluded in the superior court of california for the county of santa clara and on january 27 2014 the court entered a judgment the judgment against conagra grocery products and two other defendants ordering the creation of a california abatement fund in the amount of 115 billion liability is joint and several the company believes conagra grocery products did not inherit any liabilities of w p fuller co the company will continue to vigorously defend itself in this case and has appealed the judgment to the court of appeal of the state of california sixth appellate district the company expects the appeal process will last several years the absence of any linkage between conagra grocery products and w p fuller co is a critical issue among others that the company will continue to advance throughout the appeals process it is not possible to estimate exposure in this case or the remaining case in illinois which is based on different legal theories if ultimately necessary the company will look to its insurance policies for coverage its carriers are on notice however the extent of insurance coverage is uncertain and the company cannot absolutely assure that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the environmental proceedings associated with beatrice include litigation and administrative proceedings involving beatrices status as a potentially responsible party at 37 superfund proposed superfund or stateequivalent sites the beatrice sites these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of beatrice that used or produced petroleum pesticides fertilizers dyes inks solvents pcbs acids lead sulfur tannery wastes andor other contaminants beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 33 of these sites reserves for these beatrice environmental proceedings have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup the known volumetric contribution of beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites the accrual for beatricerelated environmental matters totaled 523 million  as of may 28 2017 a majority of which relates to the superfund and stateequivalent sites referenced above during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 a final remedial investigationfeasibility study was submitted for the wells ghsouthwest properties superfund site which is one of the beatrice sites the us environmental protection agency the epa has indicated that it will issue a record of decision for this site shortly and subsequently enter into negotiations with potentially responsible parties to determine a final remedial designremedial action plan for the site while we believe that it is unlikely it is reasonably possible that the epas decision and negotiations relating thereto may result in material liability but we are at this time unable to estimate a range of potential outcomes 

 on october 21 2015 we received a notice of violation from the louisville metro air pollution control district the district alleging certain deficiencies in the risk management plan the rmp of a manufacturing facility in louisville kentucky which we acquired in connection with our fiscal 2013 purchase of ralcorp holdings inc the notice alleged that the facility failed to implement and maintain an rmp sufficient to comply with environmental regulations governing facilities that manufacture use or otherwise handle certain quantities of specified regulated substances on january 18 2017 the districts board adopted an order resolving the alleged violations in consideration of a monetary penalty of 225000 concluding the matter 

we are also party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of our ongoing business operations these previously included lawsuits claims and other proceedings related to the february 2007 recall of our peanut butter products including an investigation by the us attorneys office in georgia and the consumer protection branch of the department of justice in may 2015 we negotiated a resolution of this matter which resulted in an executed plea agreement on december 13 2016 conagra grocery products pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor violation of the food drug  cosmetics act the us district court for the middle district of georgia accepted the plea and imposed the agreed sentence pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement conagra grocery products has now made payments totaling 112 million to the federal government and the matter has been concluded 

in june 2009 an accidental explosion occurred at our manufacturing facility in garner north carolina this facility was the primary production facility for our slim jim ®  branded meat snacks in june 2009 the us bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives announced its determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental natural gas release and not a deliberate act during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we settled our property and business interruption claims related to the garner accident with our insurance providers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 jacobs engineering group inc our engineer and project manager at the site jacobs filed a declaratory judgment action against us seeking indemnity for personal injury claims brought against it as a result of the accident during the first quarter of fiscal 2012 our 

motion for summary judgment was granted and the suit was dismissed without prejudice on the basis that the suit was filed prematurely in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 jacobs refiled its action seeking indemnity on march 25 2016 a douglas county jury in nebraska rendered a verdict in favor of jacobs and against us in the amount of 1089 million plus post judgment interest we filed our notice of appeal in september 2016 although our insurance carriers have provided customary notices of reservation of their rights under the policies of insurance we expect any ultimate exposure in this case to be limited to the applicable insurance deductible 

we are party to a number of putative class action lawsuits challenging various product claims made in the companys product labeling these matters include briseno v conagra foods inc in which it is alleged that the labeling for wesson ®  oils as 100 natural is false and misleading because the oils contain genetically modified plants and organisms in february 2015 the us district court for the central district of california granted class certification to permit plaintiffs to pursue state law claims the company appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit which affirmed class certification in january 2017 while we cannot predict with certainty the results of this or any other legal proceeding we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or business 

after taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing matters management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity it is reasonably possible that a change of the estimates of any of the foregoing matters may occur in the future and as noted while unlikely the lead paint matter could result in a material final judgment

presentation of derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results 

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings in the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately 

the following table presents the net derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions associated with continuing operations under this methodology 



as of may 28 2017  the cumulative amount of net derivative losses from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was 30 million  this amount reflected net losses of 33 million  incurred during the fiscal year ended may 28 2017  as well as net gains of 03 million  incurred prior to fiscal 2017  based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify to segment operating results losses of 12 million  in fiscal 2018  and losses of 18 million  in fiscal 2019  and thereafter 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 management determined that certain derivatives that had been previously entered into as an economic hedge of forecasted commodity purchases had ceased to function as economic hedges we recognized derivative losses of 108 million  63 million  and 27 million  and derivative gains of 09 million  within the operating results of the grocery  snacks refrigerated  frozen international and foodservice segments respectively during fiscal 2015 in connection with these derivatives management effectively exited these derivative positions in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

net sales 



overall our net sales were  783 billion  in fiscal 2017  a decrease of 10  compared to fiscal 2016  

grocery  snacks net sales for fiscal 2017  were  321 billion  a decrease of  1683 million  or 5  compared to fiscal 2016  results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 5 in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year the decrease in sales volumes was the result of reduced trade promotions and the planned exit of certain lowerperforming products pricemix was flat as the continued progress in pricing and trade productivity was fully offset by unfavorable sales mix the reduced trade promotions and selective base price increases are actions that are intended to build a higher quality revenue base the frontera acquisition and the thanasi acquisition collectively contributed 365 million or 1 to segment net sales during fiscal 2017  

refrigerated  frozen net sales for fiscal 2017  were  265 billion  a decrease of  2151 million  or 8  compared to fiscal 2016  results for fiscal 2017  reflected a 9 decrease in volume and a 1 increase in pricemix compared to fiscal 2016 the decrease in sales volumes and improvements in pricemix reflected reduced trade promotions and selective base price increases together with stockkeeping unit rationalization which actions were intended to build a higher quality revenue base net sales growth was also negatively affected by a transitory increase in the volume of egg beaters ®  in fiscal 2016 as the companys egg supply was not negatively impacted by last year’s avian influenza outbreak 

international net sales for fiscal 2017  were  8160 million  a decrease of  306 million  or 4  compared to fiscal 2016  results for fiscal 2017  reflected a 3 decrease in volume a 3 decrease due to foreign exchange rates and a 2 increase in pricemix compared to fiscal 2016 the volume decrease for fiscal 2017  was driven by significant shipments in early fiscal 2016 due to recovery from the west coast port disruptions during fiscal 2015 aggressive pricing actions reduced trade promotions and the planned discontinuation of certain lowermargin products 

foodservice net sales for fiscal 2017  were  108 billion  a decrease of  262 million  or 2  compared to fiscal 2016  results for fiscal 2017  reflected a 4 decrease in volume offset by a 2 increase in pricemix compared to fiscal 2016 the decrease in volumes primarily reflected the impact of exiting a noncore business 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we divested our spicetec and jm swank businesses these businesses comprise the entire commercial segment following the presentation of lamb weston as discontinued operations accordingly there were no net sales in the commercial segment after the first quarter of fiscal 2017 these businesses had net sales of  711 million  in fiscal 2017  prior to the completion of the divestitures net sales in the commercial segment were 4681 million  in fiscal 2016

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity and capital 

the primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives if necessary we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets we are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating 

during fiscal 2017 we entered into a revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of 125 billion subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 175 billion with the consent of the lenders this revolving credit facility replaced our existing revolving credit facility we have historically used a credit facility principally as a backup for our commercial paper program as of may 28 2017  there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for unsecured investment grade credit facilities of this type it generally requires our ratio of ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense to be not less than 30 to 10 and our ratio of funded debt to ebitda to be not greater than 375 to 10 provided that such ratio may be increased at the option of the company in connection with a material transaction with each ratio to be calculated on a rolling fourquarter basis as of may 28 2017  we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit agreement 

as of may 28 2017  we had 262 million  outstanding under our commercial paper program the highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2017  was 650 million  a s of may 29 2016 we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program 

as of the end of fiscal 2017  our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult 

we repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board of directors during fiscal 2017 the board of directors approved an additional 225 billion share repurchase authorization to the existing share repurchase program the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date under the share repurchase authorization we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years depending on market conditions and other factors and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions as of may 29 2016 the companys total remaining share repurchase authorization was 1319 million during fiscal 2017 we repurchased 251 million shares of our common stock under this authorization for an aggregate of 10 billion  the companys total remaining share repurchase authorization as of may 28 2017  was 138 billion 

on july 19 2017 the board of directors authorized a quarterly dividend payment of 02125 per share which will be paid on august 31 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on july 31 2017 

during fiscal 2017 we provided a voluntary lumpsum settlement offer to certain terminated vested participants in our salaried pension plan during fiscal 2017 2875 million was distributed to such participants from pension plan assets in connection with this offer we made pension contributions totaling 1630 million  for fiscal 2017 including a 150 million voluntary contribution made in the fourth quarter to improve the funded status of our pension plans 

on november 9 2016 we completed the spinoff of lamb weston in connection with the spinoff lamb weston issued to us 154 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes the lamb weston notes on november 9 2016 we exchanged the lamb weston notes for approximately 2502 million aggregate principal amount of our 5819 senior notes due 2017 8804 million aggregate principal amount of our 19 senior notes due 2018 1549 million aggregate principal amount of our 21 senior notes due 2018 869 million aggregate principal amount of our 70 senior notes due 2019 and 711 million aggregate principal amount of our 495 senior notes due 2020 collectively the conagra notes which had been purchased in the open market by certain investment banks prior to the spinoff following the exchange we cancelled the conagra notes we also received a cash payment of 8235 million from lamb weston as consideration for the spinoff 

during fiscal 2017 we repaid the entire principal balance of 5500 million of our floating rate notes on the maturity date of july 21 2016 we also repaid the remaining principal balance of 2248 million of our 5819 senior notes due 2017 and 2482 million principal amount of our 70 senior notes due 2019 in each case prior to maturity resulting in a net loss from the early retirement of debt of 327 million 

we have access to the 125 billion revolving credit facility our commercial paper program and the capital markets we believe we also have access to additional bank loan facilities if needed 

we have recently signed an agreement to sell our wesson ®  oil business the sale remains subject to customary closing conditions including receipt of regulatory approvals we expect to realize net proceeds from the sale of approximately 285 million 

we expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to either retire or refinance senior debt upon maturity as market conditions warrant from operating cash flows our commercial paper program proceeds from any divestitures and other disposition transactions access to capital markets and our revolving credit facility 

cash flows 

in fiscal 2017  we used 5831 million  of cash which was the net result of 118 billion  generated from operating activities 1893 million  used in investing activities 157 billion  used in financing activities and a decrease of  02 million  in cash due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled  114 billion  in fiscal 2017  as compared to  6255 million  generated in fiscal 2016  higher operating cash flows were generated by increased operating profits in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 the higher operating profits were achieved by reducing sga expenses in large part enabled by our restructuring plans as well as by achieving improved gross margins the increase was also driven by the timing of income tax payments a capital loss generated in fiscal 2016 was utilized in fiscal 2017 such that no income tax payments were required to be made for the gain realized upon the sale of the spicetec and jm swank businesses significantly lower inventory build due to lower sales volumes and lower per case cost of inventories increase in accounts payable balance due to extension of certain vendor terms and reductions of interest payments due to significant debt repayments in fiscal 2017 and 2016 also incentive compensation payments in fiscal 2017 earned in fiscal 2016 were 738 million higher than such payments made in fiscal 2016 earned in fiscal 2015 

cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was 347 million  and 6337 million  in fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  respectively this reflects the activities of the private brands business we sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and those of the lamb weston business that were spun off on november 9 2016 operating cash flows of discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 were also impacted by expenses related to the spinoff 

cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled 656 million  in fiscal 2017  compared to 2519 million  in fiscal 2016  investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of the proceeds from the divestitures of the spicetec and jm swank businesses totaling 4890 million  in the aggregate partially offset by capital expenditures of 2421 million  which included several significant plant expansions and improvements and acquisitions totaling 3257 million  including the operating assets of frontera foods inc and red fork llc and the proteinbased snacking businesses thanasi foods llc and bigs llc investing activities of continuing operations of fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 2775 million  

cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from capital expenditures cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2016 resulted primarily from the proceeds of the divestiture of our private brands business totaling 260 billion  net of cash transferred and closing costs partially offset by capital expenditures of 2476 million  

cash used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled 241 billion  in fiscal 2017  compared to 273 billion  in fiscal 2016  financing activities of continuing operations for fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of longterm debt repayments totaling 106 billion  cash dividends paid of 4150 million  and common stock repurchases totaling 10 billion  proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the issuance of other stock awards were 738 million  in fiscal 2017 cash used in financing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2016 reflect debt repayments of 252 billion  and dividends paid of 4325 million  partially offset by employee stock option exercises and the issuance of other stock awards of 2084 million  

cash provided by financing activities of discontinued operations principally comprises borrowing by lamb weston which were transferred in connection with the spinoff 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of 2514 million  at may 28 2017  and 7981 million  at may 29 2016  of which 2449 million at may 28 2017  and 1053 million at may 29 2016  was held in foreign countries the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment outside the united states with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and future foreign investments no related tax liability has been accrued as of may 28 2017  at may 28 2017  management does not intend to permanently repatriate additional foreign cash any future decision to repatriate foreign cash could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes it is not practicable to determine the amount of any such deferred tax liability at this time 

our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 is approximately 285 million 

management believes that the companys sources of liquidity will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time make payments of anticipated quarterly dividends complete planned capital expenditures and make any required debt repayments including by retiring or refinancing senior debt upon maturity as market conditions warrant for the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use offbalance sheet arrangements eg leases accounted for as operating leases where sound business principles warrant their use we also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business these are described further in obligations and commitments    below 

variable interest entities not consolidated 

we have variable interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities but for which we are not the primary beneficiary we do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities 

we lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities the lease agreements with these entities include fixedprice purchase options for the assets being leased the lease agreements also contain contingent put options the lease put options that allow the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost or fair market value without a lease agreement in place the put price in certain limited circumstances as a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested private brands operations these lease put options are exercisable now and remain exercisable until generally 30 days after the end of the respective lease agreements we are amortizing the difference between the estimated put price and the estimated fair value without a lease agreement in place of each respective property over the remaining respective lease term within selling general and administrative expenses as of may 28 2017  the estimated amount by which the put prices exceeded the fair values of the related properties was 518 million  of which we have accrued 84 million  as these buildings are worth considerably more when under lease agreements than when vacant we may be able to mitigate some or all of the financial exposure created by the put options by maintaining active lease agreements andor by subleasing the buildings to credit worthy tenants we do not expect to ultimately incur material financial losses as a result of the potential exercise of the lease put options by the lessors during fiscal 2017 one of these lease agreements expired as a result of this expiration we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of 67 million in selling general and administrative expenses these leases are accounted for as operating leases and accordingly there are no material assets or liabilities other than the accrued portion of the put price associated with these entities included in our consolidated balance sheets we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities in making this determination we have considered among other items the terms of the lease agreements the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased and the capital structure of the lessor entities

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 28 2017  was 393 million  the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 28 2017  that if recognized would impact our effective tax rate was 316 million  recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 

 critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management 

our auditfinance committee has reviewed managements development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

marketing costs —we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs which include advertising customer incentives and consumer incentives we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the judgment required in determining marketing costs can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to customers management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

we have recognized reserves of 1081 million  for these marketing costs as of may 28 2017  changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program   including amounts classified as a revenue reduction would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows 

advertising and promotion expenses totaled 3283 million  3472 million  and 3126 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts 

available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our balance sheets as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 15 pretax income and income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup managements estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately  581 million  for environmental liabilities as of may 28 2017  the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy 

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers compensation in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 

beginning in fiscal 2017 the company has elected to use a split discount rate spotrate approach for the us plans and certain foreign plans historically a single weightedaverage discount rate was used in the calculation of service and interest costs both of which are components of pension benefit costs the spotrate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost this change is considered a change in accounting estimate and has been applied prospectively the pretax reduction in total pension benefit cost associated with this change in fiscal 2017 was approximately 270 million  

we have recognized a pension liability of  5822 million  and  9466 million  a postretirement liability of  1569 million  and  2016 million  and a workers compensation liability of  415 million  and  622 million  as of the end of fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively we also have recognized a pension asset of  171 million  and  30 million  as of the end of fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status 

we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation the corridor in current period expense annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when measurement is required otherwise under generally accepted accounting principles 

we recognized pension expense benefit including activities of discontinued operations from company plans of  129 million   3708 million  and  09 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively such amounts reflect the yearend writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability of 12 million 3485 million and 69 million in fiscal 2017  

2016  and 2015  respectively this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of  2074 million   2599 million  and  2679 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we contributed  1630 million   115 million  and  127 million  to the pension plans of our continuing operations in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  128 million  to our pension plans in fiscal 2018 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate historically we have selected a discount rate each year as of our fiscal yearend measurement date for our plans based upon a highquality corporate bond yield curve for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans the corporate bond yield curve is comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moodys aa available at the measurement date at may 29 2016 the company changed to use a spotrate approach discussed above this alternative approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a highquality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate approach 

based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 383  for fiscal 2017  410  for fiscal 2016  and 415  for fiscal 2015  we selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 419  and 326  for determination of service and interest expense respectively for fiscal 2018  a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2017  would have resulted in an increase of  17 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2017  a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2017  would have resulted in an increase of  04 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2017  for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected discount rates of 390  and 383  for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plan’s investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 750  for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2017  pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by  72 million  we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 750  to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2018  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by  73 million  

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans we determine this assumption based on our longterm plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions based on this information we selected 363  and 366  for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively as the rate of compensation increase for determining our yearend pension obligation we selected 366  for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal year 2017  370  for fiscal 2016  and 425  fiscal 2015  a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017  would increase pension expense for our pension plans by  07 million  for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017  would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by  07 million  for the year we selected a rate of 363  for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2018  a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018  would increase pension expense for our pension plans by  05 million  for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018  would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by  05 million  for the year 

in october 2014 the society of actuaries retirement plan experience committee published new mortality tables and recommended their use for the measurement of us pension plan obligations with the assistance of our thirdparty actuary in measuring our pension obligations as of may 31 2015 we incorporated revised assumptions that generally reflect the mortality improvement inherent in these new tables as adjusted for experience specific to our industry 

in october 2016 the society of actuaries retirement plan experience committee published updated mortality improvement scales and recommended their use with base mortality tables for the measurement of us pension plan obligations with the assistance of our thirdparty actuary in measuring our pension obligations as of may 28 2017 we incorporated a revised improvement scale to be used with our current base mortality tables that generally reflect the mortality improvement inherent in these new tables 

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense benefit of  12 million   02 million  and  61 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we reflected liabilities of  1569 million  and  2016 million  in our balance sheets as of may 28 2017  and may 29 2016  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  187 million  to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2018  

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates also discussed above and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 318  for fiscal 2017  350  for fiscal 2016  and 365  for fiscal 2015  we have selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 333  for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2018  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 85 with the trend rate decreasing to 45 by 2024 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 



we provide workers compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the weightedaverage discount rate used at may 28 2017  was 308 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense or the liability 

business combinations impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets and goodwill —we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets including property plant and equipment to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable we generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group no impairment is recognized if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group we writedown the asset or assets to their estimated fair values the estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group 

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands while other acquired intangible assets eg customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of definitelived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience the competitive and macroeconomic environment and our operating plans the costs of definitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 

we reduce the carrying amounts of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is 

typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets 

in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

if we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks we utilize a relief from royalty methodology the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

in testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

under the quantitative impairment test the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a riskadjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period typically four or five years and the terminal period considering expected long term growth rates and trends estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in riskadjusted discounts rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit 

prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value we completed a second step of the test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss if any to be recognized in the second step we estimated an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of 

the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the impairment loss was equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill as a result of adopting accounting standards update asu 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 in anticipation of the spinoff we changed our reporting segments in accordance with applicable accounting guidance we were required to determine new reporting units at a lower level at the operating segment or one level lower as applicable when such a determination was made we were required to perform a goodwill impairment analysis for each of the new reporting units 

we performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new canadian reporting unit within the new international reporting segment estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions we estimated the future cash flows of the canadian reporting unit and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate in order to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 75 and 2 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill we recognized an impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill accordingly during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded charges totaling 1392 million for the impairment of goodwill the remaining goodwill balance of the canadian reporting unit as of may 28 2017 was 434 million 

as part of the assessment of the fair value of each asset and liability within the canadian reporting unit with the assistance of the thirdparty valuation specialist we estimated the fair value of a canadian brand to be less than its carrying value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance we recognized an impairment charge of 244 million to writedown the intangible asset to its estimated fair value 

we also performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new mexican reporting unit within the international reporting segment using similar methods to those described above we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 85 and 3 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we determined that the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately 5 accordingly we did not recognize an impairment of the goodwill in the mexican reporting unit 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits primarily due to foreign exchange rates we performed an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new mexican reporting unit we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 85 and 3 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill we recognized an impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill accordingly during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded charges totaling 439 million for the impairment of goodwill 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 in conjunction with our annual impairment testing we adopted asu 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment as a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits we performed an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new mexican reporting unit we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 90 and 3 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit we recognized an impairment charge of 158 million  equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit the remaining goodwill balance of the mexican reporting unit as of may 28 2017 was 1185 million 

in fiscal 2017 due to declining sales of certain brands we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles of those brands during fiscal 2017 we recognized impairment charges of 71 million  for our del monte ®   brand and 55 million  for our aylmer ®  brand in our international segment we also recognized impairment charges of 671 million  for our chef boyardee ®  brand and 11 million  for our fiddle faddle ®  brand in our grocery  snacks segment 

in fiscal 2016 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles during fiscal 2016 we recognized impairment charges of 501 million in our grocery  snacks segment for our chef boyardee ®  brand 

in fiscal 2015 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles during fiscal 2015 we recognized impairment charges of 48 million in our grocery  snacks segment for our poppycock ®  brand 

because forecasted sales and profits for a reporting unit in our divested private brands business continued to fall below our expectations relative to our previous projections throughout fiscal 2015 we performed quantitative analyses of goodwill on this private brands segment reporting unit in fiscal 2015 we recorded charges totaling 209 million for the impairment of goodwill in the portion of the business we retained from the private brands segment that is now included in the grocery  snacks segment 

we completed the divestiture of our private brands operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 in fiscal 2016 we recognized charges of 192 billion   144 billion  aftertax to writedown the goodwill and longlived assets of the private brands business 

during fiscal 2015 we recognized impairment charges of 151 billion  and 439 million  for goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles respectively in our private brands business during fiscal 2015 we also recognized a charge of 137 million  in our private brands business for the impairment of certain longlived assets the impairment was measured based upon an estimated disposal value for the related production facility these impairment charges are included in discontinued operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2017  and 2016  were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies 

commodity market risk 

we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products nuts sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions 

interest rate risk 

we may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt 

as of may 28 2017  and may 29 2016  the fair value of our long term debt including current installments was estimated at 332 billion  and 585 billion  respectively based on current market rates as of may 28 2017  and may 29 2016  a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1978 million and 2495 million respectively while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 2194 million and 2750 million respectively 

foreign currency risk 

in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities

we employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk including valueatrisk var models we perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions we use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of var that is used to monitor our daily risk the purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices our model uses a 95 confidence level accordingly in any given one day time period losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5 of the time we include commodity swaps futures and options and foreign exchange forwards swaps and options in this calculation the following table provides an overview of our average daily var for our energy agriculture and foreign exchange positions including discontinued operations for fiscal 2017  and 2016

general 

the following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments 

conagra foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded private branded and valueadded consumer food as well as foodservice items and ingredients we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources from time to time we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption 

we experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets our food items compete with widely advertised wellknown branded food as well as private branded and customized food items some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related food items are sold some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

many of our facilities and products we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 16  16  and 17  of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

at may 29 2016  conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 20900  employees primarily in the united states approximately 36  of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 31  are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during fiscal 2017  we believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good 

research and development 

we employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition we conduct research activities related to the development of new products research and development expense was 667 million  704 million  and 860 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

risks relating to our business 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

 our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

as of may 29 2016 we had a substantial amount of debt we have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur substantial additional debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 



 additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper in the event of a default the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our supply chain and administrative efficiency plan or scae plan 

during fiscal 2014 we announced our supply chain and administrative efficiency plan or scae plan which was an expansion of the scope of the plan to integrate ralcorp the scae plan includes steps to optimize the entire organization’s supply chain network and to improve selling general and administrative effectiveness and efficiencies although the divestiture of the private brands business was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we will continue to implement portions of the scae plan including work related to optimizing our supply chain network and pursue cost reductions through our selling general and administrative functions and productivity improvements the successful design and implementation of the scae plan presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the scae plan may not advance our business strategy as expected events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the scae plan our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the scae plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the complexity of the scae plan will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the scae plan these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from existing core businesses integrating financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected 

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material packaging and energy costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume reduced margins and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains wheat corn and oats oils beef pork poultry and energy changes in the values of these derivatives are generally recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until 

we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

the food industry is highly competitive and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases we sell branded private brand and customized food products as well as commercially branded foods and ingredients our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors in addition when branded competitors focus on price and promotion the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us 

during fiscal 2016 our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 16  of our net revenues there can be no assurance that walmart stores inc and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes government action or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have continued to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business these consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their store brand products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label or store brand competition our profitability could decline 

consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration and other national state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act or the fdca and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as previously disclosed among the matters outstanding during fiscal 2016 related to the companys 2007 peanut butter recall was an investigation by the us attorneys office in georgia and the consumer protection branch of the department of justice we cooperated with the us attorney’s office and the department of justice in regard to the investigation and in may 2015 our subsidiary conagra grocery products entered into a plea agreement with the government pursuant to which it agreed to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor under the food drug  cosmetics act the plea agreement is subject to the approval of the us district court for the middle district of georgia 

any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities the failure to achieve our goals with respect to sodium or saturated fat our research and development efforts or our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials 

packaging energy use and waste management failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the us and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could affect our net operating revenues 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as corn wheat and potatoes we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and potential disruption cyber attacks security problems and expanding social media vehicles present new risks 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to 

build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results in addition there is a risk of business interruption litigation risks and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information 

the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about the company on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation in addition the disclosure of nonpublic company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

as of may 29 2016 we had goodwill of  453 billion  and other intangibles of  128 billion  the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as the inability to quickly replace lost comanufacturing business increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry ebitda multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and   negatively impact our net worth 

the termination or expiration of current comanufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations 

our businesses periodically enter into comanufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products the terms of these agreements vary but are generally for relatively short periods of time volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the products life cycle product promotions alternative production capacity and other factors none of which are under our direct control our future ability to enter into comanufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed and a decrease in current comanufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume 

ardent mills may not achieve the benefits that are anticipated from the joint venture 

the benefits that are expected to result from our ardent mills joint venture will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated cost synergies in the transaction ardent mills ability to successfully integrate the conagra mills and horizon milling businesses and its ability to successfully manage the joint venture on a goingforward basis it is not certain that we will realize these benefits at all and if we do it is not certain how long it will take to achieve these benefits if for example we are unable to achieve the anticipated cost savings or if there are unforeseen integration costs or if ardent mills is unable to operate the joint venture smoothly in the future the financial performance of the joint venture may be negatively affected 

if we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems effective 

and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers any of these factors could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to complete our proposed divestitures our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs divert management’s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions if activist stockholder activities ensue our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees for example we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters including legal financial and communications advisors the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors customers employee and joint venture partners and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation 

the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum the referendum was advisory and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the united kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process nevertheless the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal the referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other european union member states to consider withdrawal these developments or the perception that any of them could occur have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our proposed spinoff of our lamb weston business 

the proposed spinoff of our lamb weston business is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions may require significant time and attention of our management and may have an adverse effect on us if not completed 

on november 18 2015 we announced plans to pursue the separation of conagra foods inc into two public companies conagra brands and lamb weston the transaction expected to be structured as a spinoff of the lamb weston business to the shareholders of conagra foods inc in the fall of calendar 2016 is expected to be tax free to the company and its shareholders the proposed spinoff is subject to various conditions and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions that could delay prevent or otherwise adversely affect the spinoff completion of the spinoff will be contingent upon several factors including but not limited to authorization and approval of our board of directors 

receipt of governmental and regulatory approvals of the transactions contemplated by the spinoff receipt of a tax opinion regarding the taxfree status of the spinoff execution of intercompany agreements and the effectiveness of a registration statement with the sec for these and other reasons the spinoff may not be completed as expected during 2016 if at all 

in pursuing the proposed spinoff our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences including but not limited to the following 

 if the spinoff is not completed we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the spinoff 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and the price of our common stock 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff 

although we believe that separating our lamb weston business from conagra brands will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our stockholders the spinoff may not provide such results on the scope or scale we anticipate and we may not realize the intended benefits of the spinoff in addition we will incur onetime costs in connection with the spinoff that may exceed our estimates and negate some of the benefits we expect to achieve if we do not realize these assumed benefits we could suffer a material adverse effect on our financial condition further if the proposed spinoff is completed our operational and financial profile will change upon the separation of the lamb weston business from conagra brands as a result our diversification of revenue sources will diminish and our results of operations cash flows working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility 

if the proposed spinoff of our lamb weston business is completed the trading price of our common stock will decline 

we expect the trading price of our common stock immediately following the spinoff to be lower than immediately preceding the spinoff as the trading price of our common stock will no longer reflect the value of our lamb weston business 

following the spinoff the value of your common stock in a the company and b the lamb weston business may collectively trade at an aggregate price less than what the companys common stock might trade at had the spinoff not occurred 

the common stock of a the company and b the lamb weston business that you may hold following the spinoff may collectively trade at a value less than the price at which the company’s common stock might have traded at had the spinoff not occurred reasons for this potential difference include the future performance of either the company or the lamb weston business as separate independent companies and the future stockholder base and market for the company’s common stock and those of the lamb weston business and the prices at which these shares individually trade 

the spinoff could result in substantial tax liability 

the spinoff is conditioned on our receipt of an opinion from our tax advisors in form and substance satisfactory to us that the distribution of shares of our lamb weston business in the spinoff will qualify as taxfree to the lamb weston business the company and our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d and related provisions of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code and other members of our consolidated tax reporting group the opinion will rely on among other things various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by the company and the lamb weston business which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect could jeopardize the conclusions reached by such advisor in its opinion the opinion will not be binding on the internal revenue service or irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the qualification of the spinoff as a transaction under sections 355 and 368a of the code or that any such challenge would not prevail

although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire scae plan we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of fiscal 2016 including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of costs expected to be incurred and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows as of may 29 2016 our board of directors has approved the incurrence of up to 7390 million of expenses in connection with the scae plan we have incurred or expect to incur approximately 4439 million  of charges  3155 million  of cash charges and 1284 million  of noncash charges for actions identified to date under the scae plan in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 we recognized charges in continuing operations of 2818 million and 477 million respectively in relation to the scae plan we expect to incur costs related to the scae plan over a multiyear period 

segment review 

we report our operations in two reporting segments consumer foods and commercial foods in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the operations that were previously reported within the private brands segment the private brands assets and liabilities have been reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented prior to the divestiture and the results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented minor portions of the former private brands segment were retained and have been included in the consumer foods and commercial foods segments for all periods presented minor portions of the consumer foods and commercial foods segments have been classified as discontinued operations as these were included with the sale of the private brands operations 

consumer foods 

the consumer foods reporting segment principally includes branded food sold in various retail channels primarily in north america our food products are sold in a variety of categories meals entrees condiments pasta sides snacks and desserts in various retail channels across frozen refrigerated and shelfstable temperature classes 

commercial foods 

the commercial foods reporting segment includes commercially branded and private label food and ingredients which are sold primarily to commercial restaurant foodservice food manufacturing and industrial customers the segments primary food items include frozen potato and sweet potato items and a variety of vegetable spice and frozen bakery goods which are sold under brands such as lamb weston ®  and spicetec flavors  seasonings ®  

presentation of derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results 

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings in the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately 

the following table presents the net derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions associated with continuing operations under this methodology 



as of may 29 2016  the cumulative amount of net derivative gains from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was 32 million  this amount reflected net gains of 36 million  incurred during the fiscal year ended may 29 2016  as well as net losses of 04 million  incurred prior to fiscal 2016  based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify to segment operating results gains of 24 million  in fiscal 2017  and gains of 08 million  in fiscal 2018  and thereafter 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 management determined that certain derivatives that had been previously entered into as an economic hedge of forecasted commodity purchases had ceased to function as economic hedges we recognized 189 million  and 14 million  of net derivative losses during fiscal 2015 within the operating results of the consumer foods and commercial foods segments respectively in connection with these derivatives management effectively exited these derivative positions in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 

fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015

consumer foods net sales for fiscal 2016  were  723 billion  a decrease of  3402 million  or 5  compared to fiscal 2015  results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 5 in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the exclusion of an additional week of results that occurred in 2015 as well as the negative impact on volume from pricing actions in addition there was a 1 improvement in pricemix that was offset by a decrease of 1 due to the impact of foreign exchange rates we implemented changes to improve the efficiency of trade spending increased prices on banquet ® and other brands in connection with product improvements and have focused on improving mix 

sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands including blue bonnet ®   egg beaters ®  marie callenders ®  peter pan ®  reddiwip ®   and slim jim ®  grew in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  significant brands whose products experienced sales declines in fiscal 2016  include banquet ®  chef boyardee ®  healthy choice ®  hebrew national ®  hunts ®  orville redenbachers ®   rosarita ®  snack pack ®  and wesson ®

selling general and administrative sga expenses includes general corporate expenses 

sga expenses totaled  221 billion  for fiscal 2016 an increase of  6641 million  compared to fiscal 2015 we estimate that the inclusion of an extra week in the fiscal 2015 resulted in additional sga expenses in fiscal 2015 of approximately 30 million 

sga expenses for fiscal 2016 reflected the following 

 sga expenses for fiscal 2015  included 



 operating profit earnings before general corporate expenses interest expense net income taxes and equity method investment earnings

interest expense net 

in fiscal 2016  net interest expense was  2978 million  a decrease of  322 million  or 10  from fiscal 2015 the decrease reflects the repayment of debt interest expense in fiscal 2016 and 2015 reflected a net benefit of 29 million and 81 million respectively primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed rate to floating rate 

income taxes

 in fiscal 2015 we implemented a new position and took a tax credit that applied to prior year tax returns which resulted in an income tax benefit of 52 million

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity and capital 

our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives if necessary we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets we are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating 

at may 29 2016  we had a 15 billion revolving credit facility the facility is scheduled to mature in september 2018 the facility has historically been used principally as a backup facility for our commercial paper program as of may 29 2016  there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility the facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65 of our consolidated capital base and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 175 to 10 on september 21 2015 the company entered into an amendment to the facility to exclude certain noncash impairments from the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio as of may 29 2016  we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

as of may 29 2016  and may 31 2015  we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program the highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2016  was 4013 million in part attributable to the use of commercial paper borrowings to fund the payment of the 2500 million of 135 senior debt which became due in september 2015 

as of the end of fiscal 2016  our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult 

we repurchase our shares of common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board of directors in december 2011 the companys board of directors approved a 7500 million increase to our share repurchase authorization under the share repurchase authorization we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years depending on market conditions and other factors and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions the authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time we repurchased 14 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 500 million under this program in fiscal 2015 the companys total remaining share repurchase authorization as of may 29 2016  was 1319 million 

we have access to the 15 billion revolving credit facility our commercial paper program and the capital markets in addition to cash and cash equivalents totaling 8345 million  as of may 29 2016  we believe we also have access to additional bank loan facilities if needed 

we have recently signed separate agreements to sell the spicetec flavors  seasonings and jm swank businesses and expect to complete these sales in early fiscal 2017 subject to customary closing conditions we expect to realize net proceeds from the sales in early fiscal 2017 of 3165 million and 1624 million respectively 

in fiscal 2016 we announced our plans to separate conagra foods inc into two public companies conagra brands and lamb weston although we have not finalized plans for our future capital structure management believes the aforementioned sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet required debt repayments planned capital expenditures working capital needs and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future 

although a significant amount of our senior debt will mature over the next several years including 5500 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes due in july 2016 we expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to either retire or refinance such debt as market conditions warrant from operating cash flows our commercial paper program proceeds from any divestitures and other disposition transactions access to capital markets and our revolving credit facility

cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled  105 billion  in fiscal 2016  as compared to  122 billion  generated in fiscal 2015  the decrease was mainly driven by a 1586 million increase in income tax payments for fiscal 2016 compared to those made in fiscal 2015 from continuing operations cash flows from changes in working capital for continuing operations for 2016 were comparable to those of 2015 increases in receivables partially attributable to payment term concessions granted to major customers were offset by lower inventory levels due to favorable commodity prices and supply decreases and further reduced by increases in accrued expenses related to incentives and restructuring activities in connection with the scae plan also annual incentive compensation payments were approximately 220 million more in fiscal 2016 earned in fiscal 2015 than in fiscal 2015 earned in fiscal 2014 and approximately 432 million of cash was used to settle certain sharebased incentive awards in fiscal 2016 

cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was 1621 million  and 2652 million  in fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  respectively the contribution of cash from operating activities of discontinued operations reflects the activities of the private brands business for a full year in fiscal 2015 and three quarters in fiscal 2016 and the limited results of the milling business which were included in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 

investing activities of continuing operations used 3975 million  in fiscal 2016  compared to 372 million  in fiscal 2015  investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2016  consisted primarily of capital expenditures of  4298 million  which included several significant plant expansions and improvements investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2015  consisted primarily of  3914 million  received from ardent mills in connection with the formation of that joint venture

 our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 is approximately 585 million this includes amounts attributable to the lamb weston business 

management believes that existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs planned capital expenditures and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months

we lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities the lease agreements with these entities include fixedprice purchase options for the assets being leased the lease agreements also contain contingent put options the “lease put options” that allow the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost or fair market value without a lease agreement in place the “put price” in certain limited circumstances as a result of substantial impairment charges related to our private brands operations these lease put options are exercisable now and remain exercisable until generally 30 days after the end of the respective lease agreements we are amortizing the difference between the estimated put price and the estimated fair value without a lease agreement in place of each respective property over the remaining respective lease term within selling general and administrative expenses as of may 29 2016  the estimated amount by which the put prices exceeded the fair values of the related properties was 585 million  of which we have accrued 93 million  as these buildings are worth considerably more when under lease agreements than when vacant we may be able to mitigate some or all of the financial exposure created by the put options by maintaining active lease agreements andor by subleasing the buildings to credit worthy tenants we do not expect to ultimately incur material financial losses as a result of the potential exercise of the lease put options by the lessors these leases are accounted for as operating leases and accordingly there are no material assets or liabilities other than the accrued portion of the put price associated with these entities included in our consolidated balance sheets we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities in making this determination we have considered among other items the terms of the lease agreements the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased and the capital structure of the lessor entities 

obligations and commitments 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements debt agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as takeorpay contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available of these items debt notes payable capital lease obligations and other contracts which totaled 56 billion as of may 29 2016  were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations which totaled 17 billion as of may 29 2016  were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of may 29 2016  was as follows 



1  amount includes open purchase orders and agreements some of which are not legally binding andor may be cancellable such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year excludes purchase commitments under potato supply agreements due to uncertainty of pricing and quantity 

we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our longterm debt and capital lease obligations the weighted average coupon interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 29 2016  was approximately 43 

we own a 4999 interest in lamb weston bsw llc lamb weston bsw a potato processing venture with ochoa ag unlimited foods inc ochoa we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston bsw under certain circumstances we could be required to compensate ochoa for lost profits resulting from significant production shortfalls production shortfalls commencing on june 1 2018 or on an earlier date under certain circumstances we have a contractual right to purchase the remaining equity interest in lamb weston bsw from ochoa the call option we are currently subject to a contractual obligation to purchase all of ochoas equity investment in lamb weston bsw at the option of ochoa the 

put option the purchase prices under the call option and the put option the options are based on the book value of ochoas equity interest at the date of exercise as modified by an agreedupon rate of return for the holding period of the investment balance the agreedupon rate of return varies depending on the circumstances under which any of the options are exercised as of may 29 2016  the price at which ochoa had the right to put its equity interest to us was 474 million  this amount which is presented within other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets is not included in the contractual obligations table above as the payment is contingent upon the exercise of the put option by ochoa and the eventual occurrence and timing of such exercise is uncertain 

as of may 29 2016 we had aggregate unfunded pension obligations totaling 9436 million this amount is not included in the table above as the unfunded pension obligation is markedtomarket each fiscal year and we do not expect to be required to make payments to fund these amounts in the next few years based on current statutory requirements we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next twelve months we estimate that we will make payments of approximately 102 million over the next twelve months to fund current benefits of nonqualified pension plans see note 19  pension and postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements and  critical accounting estimates  employment related benefits  for further discussion of our pension obligations and factors that could affect estimates of this liability 

as part of our ongoing operations we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event eg guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets a summary of our commitments including commitments associated with equity method investments as of may 29 2016  was as follows 



we are a party to various potato supply agreements under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements we have guaranteed repayment of shortterm bank loans of the potato suppliers under certain conditions at may 29 2016  the amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was 405 million  included in the table above we have not established a liability for these guarantees as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote 

federal income tax credits were generated related to our sweet potato production facility in delhi louisiana third parties invested in these income tax credits we have guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income tax credits over their statutory lives through fiscal 2017 in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or reduced the face value of the income tax credits was 267 million included in the table above as of may 29 2016  we believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax credits is remote and therefore we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee 

we hold a 50 ownership interest in lambwestonmeijer vof “lamb weston meijer” a netherlands joint venture headquartered in the netherlands that manufactures and sells frozen potato products principally in europe we and our partner are jointly and severally liable for all legal liabilities of lamb weston meijer as of may 29 2016 and may 31 2015 the total liabilities of lamb weston meijer were 2037 million  and 1291 million  respectively lamb weston meijer is well capitalized with partners’ equity of 2845 million  and 2559 million  as of may 29 2016 and may 31 2015 respectively we have not established a liability on our balance sheets for the obligations of lamb weston meijer as we have determined the likelihood of any required payment by us to settle such liabilities of lamb weston meijer is remote 

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 29 2016  was 384 million  the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 29 2016  that if recognized would impact our effective tax rate was 213 million  recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 

 critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management 

our auditfinance committee has reviewed management’s development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

marketing costs —we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs which include advertising customer incentives and consumer incentives we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the judgment required in determining marketing costs can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to customers management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

we have recognized reserves of  1507 million  for these marketing costs as of may 29 2016  changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program   including amounts classified as a revenue reduction would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows 

advertising and promotion expenses totaled 3714 million  3300 million  and 3957 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our balance sheets as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 15 “ pretax income and income taxes ” to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup management’s estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above management’s estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately  558 million  for environmental liabilities as of may 29 2016  the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy 

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers’ compensation in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 

as of may 29 2016 the company has elected to use a split discount rate spotrate approach for the us plans and certain foreign plans historically the weightedaverage discount rate was used in the calculation of service and interest costs both of which are components of pension expense we plan to utilize a spot rate approach in the calculation of pension interest and service cost for fiscal 2017 and beyond the spot rate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension interest and service cost this calculation change is considered a change in accounting estimate and will be applied prospectively in fiscal 2017 

we have recognized a pension liability of  9466 million  and  5737 million  a postretirement liability of  2016 million  and  2353 million  and a workers’ compensation liability of  622 million  and  1001 million  as of the end of fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively we also have recognized a pension asset of  30 million  and  205 million  as of the end of fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status 

we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation “the corridor” in current period expense annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when measurement is required otherwise under generally accepted accounting principles 

we recognized pension expense benefit from company plans of  3708 million   09 million  and  59 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively such amounts reflect the yearend writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability of 3485 million 69 million and 27 million in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of  2599 million   2679 million  and  2529 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we contributed  115 million   127 million  and  183 million  to the pension plans of our continuing operations in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  125 million  to our pension plans in fiscal 2017 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate historically we have selected a discount rate each year as of our fiscal yearend measurement date for our plans based upon a highquality corporate bond yield curve for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans the corporate bond yield curve is comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moody’s aa available at the measurement date at may 29 2016 the company changed to use a spotrate approach discussed above this alternative approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a highquality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate approach 

based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 410  for fiscal 2016  415  for fiscal 2015  and 405  for fiscal 2014  we selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 414  and 315  for determination of service and interest expense respectively for fiscal 2017  a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2016  would have resulted in a decrease of  1097 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2016  a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2016  would have resulted in an increase of  1157 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2016  for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected discount rates of 383  and 410  for fiscal years 2016  and 2015  respectively 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plan’s investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated 

longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 775  for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2016  pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2016  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by  87 million  we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 750  to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2017  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by  72 million  

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans we determine this assumption based on our longterm plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions based on this information we selected 366  and 370  for fiscal years 2016  and 2015  respectively as the rate of compensation increase for determining our yearend pension obligation we selected 370  for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal year 2016  425  for fiscal 2015  and 425  fiscal 2014  respectively a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2016  would increase pension expense for our pension plans by  11 million  for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2016  would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by  16 million  for the year we selected a rate of 366  for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2017  a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017  would increase pension expense for our pension plans by  07 million  for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017  would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by  07 million  for the year 

in october 2014 the society of actuaries retirement plan experience committee published new mortality tables and recommended their use for the measurement of us pension plan obligations with the assistance of our thirdparty actuary in measuring our pension obligations as of may 31 2015 we incorporated revised assumptions that generally reflect the mortality improvement inherent in these new tables as adjusted for experience specific to our industry 

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense of  02 million   61 million  and  99 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we reflected liabilities of  2016 million  and  2353 million  in our balance sheets as of may 29 2016  and may 31 2015  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  221 million  to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2017  

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates also discussed above and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 350  for fiscal 2016  365  for fiscal 2015  and 335  for fiscal 2014  we have selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 318  for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2017  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2016 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 90 with the trend rate decreasing to 45 by 2024 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 



we provide workers’ compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the weightedaverage discount rate used at may 29 2016  was 257 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers’ compensation expense 

business combinations impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets and goodwill —we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets including property plant and equipment to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable we generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group no impairment is recognized if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group we writedown the asset or assets to their estimated fair values the estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group 

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands while other acquired intangible assets eg customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of definitelived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience the competitive and macroeconomic environment and our operating plans the costs of definitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 

we reduce the carrying amounts of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets 

in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

if we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks we utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital 

in fiscal 2016 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles during fiscal 2016 we recognized impairment charges of 501 million in our consumer foods segment for our chef boyardee ®  brand 

in fiscal 2015 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles during fiscal 2015 we recognized impairment charges of 48 million in our consumer foods segment for our poppycock ®  brand 

in fiscal 2014 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles we recognized impairment charges of 727 million in our consumer foods segment primarily for our chef boyardee ®  brand we also recognized a 32 million impairment charge for an amortizable technology license in our corporate expenses in fiscal 2014 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

in testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test the first step of the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a riskadjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period typically four or five years and the terminal period considering expected long term growth rates and trends estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in riskadjusted discounts rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit 

if the fair value of a reporting unit determined in the first step of the evaluation is lower than its carrying value we proceed to the second step which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value in estimating the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit we must assign the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities associated with the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination ie we estimate the fair value of each asset and liability held in the reporting unit the various assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are generally not adjusted to their new estimated fair values unless impairments of any individual assets are indicated the implied goodwill is equal to the residual of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of each identifiable asset and liability within the reporting unit any excess of the carrying value of goodwill of the reporting unit over its implied fair value is recorded as impairment 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 in conjunction with our annual review for impairment we performed a qualitative analysis of goodwill for the reporting units in our consumer foods and commercial foods segments because forecasted sales and profits for the international reporting unit in our consumer foods segment continued to fall below our expectations relative to our previous projections throughout fiscal 2016 largely as a result of foreign exchange rates we performed quantitative analyses of goodwill on this segment reporting unit in fiscal 2016 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions we estimated the future cash flows of the international reporting unit and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate in order to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 75 and 3 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective historical carrying value including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was greater than the carrying value in fiscal 2016 with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation 

specialist we estimated the fair value of this reporting unit and determined that we had 12 cushion over the carrying value as such the results of the quantitative analysis did not result in an impairment of the international reporting unit 

because forecasted sales and profits for a reporting unit in our divested private brands business continued to fall below our expectations relative to our previous projections throughout fiscal 2015 we performed quantitative analyses of goodwill on this private brands segment reporting unit in fiscal 2015 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions we estimated the future cash flows of each reporting unit within the private brands segment and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate in order to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 8 and 3 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective historical carrying value including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in fiscal 2015 with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of each of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill of each reporting unit we recognized an impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill at the respective measurement dates accordingly during fiscal 2015 we recorded charges totaling 209 million for the impairment of goodwill in the portion of the business we retained from the private brands segment that is now included in the grocery reporting unit of the consumer foods segment 

during fiscal 2014 we recorded a 90 million charge for the impairment of goodwill in the portion of the business we retained from the private brands segment that is now included in our grocery reporting unit of the consumer foods segment 

we completed the divestiture of our private brands operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 in fiscal 2016 we recognized charges of 192 billion   144 billion  aftertax to writedown the goodwill and longlived assets of the private brands business 

during fiscal 2015 we recognized impairment charges of 151 billion  and 439 million  for goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles respectively in our private brands business during fiscal 2015 we also recognized a charge of 137 million  in our private brands business for the impairment of certain longlived assets the impairment was measured based upon an estimated disposal value for the related production facility these impairment charges are included in discontinued operations 

recently issued accounting pronouncements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2016  and 2015  were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies these fluctuations impacted all reporting segments 

commodity market risk 

we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions 

interest rate risk 

we may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt 

as of may 29 2016  and may 31 2015  the fair value of our long term debt including current installments was estimated at 59 billion and 82 billion respectively based on current market rates provided primarily by outside investment advisors as of may 29 2016  and may 31 2015  a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 2495 million and 4286 million respectively while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 2750 million and 4795 million respectively 

foreign currency risk 

in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 

valueatrisk var 

we employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk including valueatrisk var models we perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions we use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of var that is used to monitor our daily risk the purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices our model uses a 95 confidence level accordingly in any given one day time period losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5 of the time we include commodity swaps futures and options and foreign exchange forwards swaps and options in this calculation the following table provides an overview of our average daily var for our energy agriculture foreign exchange and other commodities including discontinued operations for fiscal 2016  and 2015  other commodities below consist primarily of forward and option contracts for a commodities index which includes items such as agricultural commodities energy commodities and metals the other commodities category below may also include items such as packaging andor livestock

general 

the following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments 

conagra foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded private branded and valueadded consumer food as well as foodservice items and ingredients we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources from time to time we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption 

we experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets our food items compete with widely advertised wellknown branded food as well as private branded and customized food items some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related food items are sold some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

many of our facilities and products we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 18  19  and 20  of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

at may 31 2015  conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 32900  employees primarily in the united states approximately 32  of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 25  are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during fiscal 2016  we believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good

our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

as of may 31 2015 we had a substantial amount of debt including 424 billion of senior notes that we issued or in connection with the acquisition of ralcorp we have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur substantial additional debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 

 additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper in the event of a default the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our supply chain and administrative efficiency plan or scae plan 

during fiscal 2014 we announced our supply chain and administrative efficiency plan or scae plan which was an expansion of the scope of the plan to integrate ralcorp the scae plan includes steps to optimize the entire organization’s supply chain network and to improve selling general and administrative effectiveness and efficiencies as well as our continuing evaluation of plans for the integration of ralcorp and related restructuring activities as discussed above on june 30 2015 we announced our intent to divest our private brands operations a divestiture of our private brands operations may not occur in a timely manner or at all and we will continue to implement the work related to optimizing our supply chain network and pursue cost reductions through our selling general and administrative functions and productivity improvemnts the successful design and implementation of the scae plan presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the scae plan may not advance our business strategy as expected events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the scae plan our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the scae plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the complexity of the scae plan will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the scae plan these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from existing core businesses integrating financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected 

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material packaging and energy costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume reduced margins and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains wheat corn and oats oils beef pork poultry and energy changes in the values of these derivatives are generally recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

the food industry is highly competitive and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases we sell branded private brand and customized food products as well as commercially branded foods and ingredients our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors in addition when branded competitors focus on price and promotion the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

significant private brand competitive activity can lead to volatility in results and margin compression 

private brand customer buying decisions are often based on a periodic bidding process our sales volume may decrease significantly if our offer is too high and we lose the ability to sell private brand products through these channels even temporarily alternatively we risk reducing our margins if our offer is successful but below our desired price either of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us 

during fiscal 2015 our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 18  of our net revenues there can be no assurance that walmart stores inc and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential 

effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes government action or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have continued to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business these consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their store brand products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label or store brand competition our profitability could decline 

consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration and other national state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act or the fdca and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as previously disclosed among the matters outstanding during fiscal 2015 related to the companys 2007 peanut butter recall was an investigation by the us attorneys office in georgia and the consumer protection branch of the department of justice we cooperated with the us attorney’s office and the department of justice in regard to the investigation and in may 2015 our subsidiary conagra grocery products entered into an executed plea agreement with the government pursuant to which it agreed to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor under the food drug  cosmetics act the plea agreement is subject to the approval of the us district court for the middle district of georgia 

any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities the failure to achieve our goals with respect to sodium or saturated fat our research and development efforts or our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the us and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could affect our net operating revenues 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as corn wheat and potatoes we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and potential disruption cyber attacks security problems and expanding social media vehicles present new risks 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results in addition there is a risk of business interruption litigation risks and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information 

the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about the company on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation in addition the disclosure of nonpublic company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

in connection with ralcorps separation of its post brand cereals business post agreed to indemnify ralcorp for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that posts ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement that ralcorp entered into with post in connection with the separation of ralcorps post brand cereals business post agreed to indemnify ralcorp for certain liabilities third parties may seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that post agreed to retain or assume and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from post will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that post will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in addition even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from post any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

as of may 31 2015 we had goodwill of  630 billion  and other intangibles of  303 billion  the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized 

intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as the inability to quickly replace lost comanufacturing business increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry ebitda multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and   negatively impact our net worth 

following the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2015 the carrying value of goodwill in our private brands reporting units included 2693 million  for cereal 5882 million  for pasta 2765 million  for snacks and 5355 million  for retail bakery all of the goodwill for the bars and coordinated and condiments reporting units was impaired as of the end of fiscal 2015 if the future performance of one or more of the reporting units within the private brands segment falls short of our expectations or if there are significant changes in riskadjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions we could be required to recognize additional material impairment charges in future periods 

the termination or expiration of current comanufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations 

our businesses periodically enter into comanufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products the terms of these agreements vary but are generally for relatively short periods of time volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the products life cycle product promotions alternative production capacity and other factors none of which are under our direct control our future ability to enter into comanufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed and a decrease in current comanufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume 

ardent mills may not achieve the benefits that are anticipated from the joint venture 

the benefits that are expected to result from the recently formed ardent mills joint venture will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated cost synergies in the transaction ardent mills ability to successfully integrate the conagra mills and horizon milling businesses and its ability to successfully manage the joint venture on a goingforward basis it is not certain that we will realize these benefits at all and if we do it is not certain how long it will take to achieve these benefits if for example we are unable to achieve the anticipated cost savings or if there are unforeseen integration costs or if ardent mills is unable to operate the joint venture smoothly in the future the financial performance of the joint venture may be negatively affected 

if we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers any of these factors could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs divert management’s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions if activist stockholder activities ensue our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees for example we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters including legal financial and communications advisors the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability 

to attract new investors customers employee and joint venture partners and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation

the environmental proceedings associated with beatrice include litigation and administrative proceedings involving beatrices status as a potentially responsible party at 37 superfund proposed superfund or stateequivalent sites these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of beatrice that used or produced petroleum pesticides fertilizers dyes inks solvents pcbs acids lead sulfur tannery wastes andor other contaminants beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 33 of these sites reserves for these matters have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup the known volumetric contribution of beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites the reserves for beatricerelated environmental matters totaled 537 million  as of may 31 2015 a majority of which relates to the superfund and stateequivalent sites referenced above we expect expenditures for beatricerelated environmental matters to continue for up to 18 years 

we are also a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of our ongoing business operations among these there are lawsuits claims and matters related to the february 2007 recall of our peanut butter products among the matters outstanding during fiscal 2015 related to the peanut butter recall was an investigation by the us attorneys office in georgia and the consumer protection branch of the department of justice into the 2007 recall just prior to the end of fiscal 2015 we negotiated a resolution of this matter which resulted in an executed plea agreement pursuant to which conagra grocery products will plead guilty to a single misdemeanor violation of the food drug  cosmetics act if the plea is accepted by the us district court for the middle district of georgia the government’s investigation into the 2007 recall will conclude and conagra grocery products will make payments totaling 112 million to the federal government expenses related to this payment were accrued in previous periods during fiscal 2013 and 2012 we recognized charges of 75 million and 175 million respectively in connection with this matter during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we reduced our accrual by 67 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we further reduced our accrual by 58 million and further reduced it by 12 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 based on ongoing discussions with the us attorneys office and the department of justice the plea agreement is subject to court approval which will be sought along with the formal sentencing process in the coming months

managements primary objective for fiscal 2015 was stabilization and recovery fiscal 2015 performance reflected increased volumes in the consumer foods and commercial foods segments primarily due to the extra week in the fiscal year private brands performance continued to reflect weak volumes and margin pressures resulting from an intense bidding environment and executional challenges we generated operating cash flows of approximately 147 billion  from continuing operations and repaid 11 billion of debt during fiscal 2015

presentation of derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results 

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings in the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately 

the following table presents the net derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions under this methodology 



as of may 31 2015  the cumulative amount of net derivative losses from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was 233 million  this amount reflected net losses of 237 million  incurred during the fiscal year ended may 31 2015  as well as net gains of 04 million  incurred prior to fiscal 2015  based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify to segment operating results losses of 235 million  in fiscal 2016  and gains of 02 million  in fiscal 2017  and thereafter 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 management determined that certain derivatives that had been previously entered into as an economic hedge of forecasted commodity purchases had ceased to function as economic hedges we recognized 189 million  52 million  and 14 million  of net derivative losses during fiscal 2015 within the operating results of the consumer foods private brands and commercial foods segments respectively in connection with these derivatives management effectively exited these derivative positions in the third quarter of fiscal 2015

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity and capital 

our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives if necessary we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets we are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating 

at may 31 2015  we had a 15 billion revolving credit facility the facility is scheduled to mature in september 2018 the facility has historically been used principally as a backup facility for our commercial paper program as of may 31 2015  there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility the facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65of our consolidated capital base and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 175 to 10 on march 23 2015 the company entered into an amendment to the facility to exclude certain goodwill and other intangible asset impairments from the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio as of may 31 2015  we were in compliance with these financial covenants

as of the end of fiscal 2015  our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult 

we repurchase our shares of common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board of directors in december 2011 the companys board of directors approved a 7500 million increase to our share repurchase authorization under the share repurchase authorization we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years depending on market conditions and other factors and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions the authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time we repurchased 14 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 500 million under this program in fiscal 2015 the companys total remaining share repurchase authorization as of may 31 2015  was 1319 million

in fiscal 2015 the company completed its multiyear debt reduction goal of repaying 21 billion between the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and the end of fiscal 2015 exceeding the goal of 20 billion of debt repayment in that time period despite the progress in debt reduction the company continues to have a substantial amount of debt outstanding given weakerthanplanned operating performance the company’s leverage ratios are still higher than targeted so debt reduction is expected to remain a component of capital allocation in the foreseeable future 

on june 30 2015 the company announced its intention to sell the private brands operations at this time the impact of the sale of these operations on the companys liquidity is unknown 

cash flows 

in fiscal 2015  we generated 148 billion  from operating activities used  416 million  for investing activities used 143 billion  for financing activities and had a decrease of  88 million  in cash due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled  147 billion  in fiscal 2015  as compared to  145 billion  generated in fiscal 2014  operating cash outflows for interest payments decreased 579 million to 3377 million in fiscal 2015 as a result of the decreases in outstanding debt we contributed 135 million  and 183 million  to our pension plans in fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively we paid approximately 860 million less in annual incentive compensation payments in fiscal 2015  earned in fiscal 2014  than in fiscal 2014  earned in fiscal 2013 increases in inventory in fiscal 2015 resulted from lower volumes in international shipments in our fiscal third quarter due to the slowdown from the west coast port labor dispute expansion of our potato manufacturing capacity in the united states and china higher durum wheat costs and larger harvests of corn tomatoes and potatoes reductions in cash outflows for advertising and promotions in our consumer foods business have been largely offset by increases in trade promotions during fiscal 2015 our income tax payments were approximately 477 million more than those made in fiscal 2014 due primarily to prior year income tax deductions related to the ralcorp debt exchange and ralcorp loss carryforwards from fiscal 2013 we received dividends of 779 million from our investment in the ardent mills joint venture during fiscal 2015 cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was 69 million  and 1140 million  in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 respectively reflecting the timing of the milling business disposition 

investing activities used 416 million  in fiscal 2015  versus 5315 million  in fiscal 2014  investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2015 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of  4719 million  and acquisitions of a potato manufacturer in china and an organic frozen food business in the united states totaling 957 million  capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 were lower than fiscal 2014 as a result of fewer significant plant expansions and improvements in fiscal 2014 we purchased certain frozen dessert production assets for 399 million  million the fiscal 2015 investments were offset by 3914 million  in cash received from ardent mills in connection with the formation of that joint venture cash generated from investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2015 totaled 1140 million  resulting from receipt of 1630 million cash associated with the sale of three flour milling facilities at the end of fiscal 2014 partially offset by 490 million cash contributed to ardent mills upon the formation of the joint venture investing activities of discontinued operations generated 582 million  in fiscal 2014 primarily from the sale of assets of the lightlife and medallion foods businesses offset by capital expenditures in our former milling operations 

cash used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled 143 billion  in fiscal 2015 compared to 103 billion  in fiscal 2014 in fiscal 2015 we repaid 150 billion  of longterm debt partially financed by the issuance of 5500 million  aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes we also reduced short term debt primarily commercial paper by 1500 million  in fiscal 2014 we decreased our total debt by 6124 million including the repayment of 5000 million aggregate principal amount of our 5875 senior notes upon maturity in april 2014 during fiscal 2015  and 2014  we paid dividends of 4252 million  and 4209 million  respectively in fiscal 2015  and 2014  we repurchased 500 million  and 1000 million  respectively of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program amounts generated from proceeds of employee stock option exercises and issuance of other stock awards were 1538 million  and 1037 million  in fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of 1831 million  at may 31 2015  and 1413 million  at may 25 2014  of which 1023 million at may 31 2015  and 1045 million at may 25 2014  was held in foreign countries as of may 31 2015 and may 25 2014 certain of the companys foreign subsidiaries had extended short term loans to domestic entities totaling 364 million and 378 million respectively domestic entities repaid these amounts early in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment outside the united states with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and future foreign investments no related tax liability has been accrued as of may 31 2015  at may 31 2015  management does not intend to permanently repatriate additional foreign cash any future decision to repatriate foreign cash could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes it is not practicable to determine the amount of any such deferred tax liability at this time 

 our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 is approximately 575 million this includes amounts attributable to the private brands operations we intend to divest 

management believes that existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs planned capital expenditures and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use offbalance sheet arrangements eg leases accounted for as operating leases where sound business principles warrant their use we also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business these are described further in “ obligations and commitments ” below 

variable interest entities not consolidated 

we have variable interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities but for which we are not the primary beneficiary we do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities 

we hold a 500  interest in lamb weston rdo a potato processing venture we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston rdo we receive a fee for these services based on a percentage of the net sales of the venture we reflect the value of our ownership interest in this venture in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets based upon the equity method of accounting the balance of our investment was 146 million  and 126 million  at may 31 2015  and may 25 2014  respectively representing our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this venture the capital structure of lamb weston rdo includes owners equity of 292 million  and term borrowings from banks of 416 million  as of may 31 2015  we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this venture 

we lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities the lease agreements with these entities include fixedprice purchase options for the assets being leased representing our only variable interest in these lessor entities these leases are accounted for as operating leases and accordingly there are no material assets or liabilities associated with these entities included in our consolidated balance sheets we have no material exposure to loss from our variable interests in these entities we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities in making this determination we have considered among other items the terms of the lease agreements the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased and the capital structure of the lessor entities 

obligations and commitments 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements debt agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as takeorpay contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available of these items debt notes payable and capital lease obligations which totaled  78 billion  as of may 31 2015  were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets operating lease obligations and 

unconditional purchase obligations which totaled  24 billion  as of may 31 2015  were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of may 31 2015  was as follows 



1  amount includes open purchase orders and agreements some of which are not legally binding andor may be cancellable such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year 

we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our longterm debt and capital lease obligations the weighted average coupon interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 31 2015  was approximately 41 

the operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by noncancellable sublease rentals of 296 million 

we own a 4999 interest in lamb weston bsw llc lamb weston bsw a potato processing venture with ochoa ag unlimited foods inc ochoa we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston bsw under certain circumstances we could be required to compensate ochoa for lost profits resulting from significant production shortfalls production shortfalls commencing on june 1 2018 or on an earlier date under certain circumstances we have a contractual right to purchase the remaining equity interest in lamb weston bsw from ochoa the call option we are currently subject to a contractual obligation to purchase all of ochoas equity investment in lamb weston bsw at the option of ochoa the put option the purchase prices under the call option and the put option the options are based on the book value of ochoas equity interest at the date of exercise as modified by an agreedupon rate of return for the holding period of the investment balance the agreedupon rate of return varies depending on the circumstances under which any of the options are exercised as of may 31 2015  the price at which ochoa had the right to put its equity interest to us was 416 million  this amount which is presented within other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets is not included in the contractual obligations table above as the payment is contingent upon the exercise of the put option by ochoa and the eventual occurrence and timing of such exercise is uncertain 

as part of our ongoing operations we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event eg guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets a summary of our commitments including commitments associated with equity method investments as of may 31 2015  was as follows 



we are a party to various potato supply agreements under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements we have guaranteed repayment of shortterm bank loans of the potato suppliers under certain conditions at may 31 2015  the amount 

of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was 393 million included in the table above we have not established a liability for these guarantees as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote 

federal income tax credits were generated related to our sweet potato production facility in delhi louisiana third parties invested in these income tax credits we have guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income tax credits over their statutory lives through fiscal 2017 in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or reduced the face value of the income tax credits was 267 million included in the table above as of may 31 2015  we believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax credits is remote and therefore we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee 

we hold a fifty percent ownership interest in lambwestonmeijer vof “lamb weston meijer” a netherlands joint venture headquartered in the netherlands that manufactures and sells frozen potato products principally in europe we and our partner are jointly and severally liable for all legal liabilities of lamb weston meijer as of may 31 2015 and may 25 2014 the total liabilities of lamb weston meijer were 1291 million and 1447 million respectively lamb weston meijer is well capitalized with partners’ equity of 2559 million and 2470 million as of may 31 2015 and may 25 2014 respectively we have not established a liability on our balance sheets for the obligations of lamb weston meijer as we have determined the likelihood of any required payment by us to settle such liabilities of lamb weston meijer is remote 

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 31 2015  was 737 million  the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 31 2015  that if recognized would impact our effective tax rate was 432 million  recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 

 critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management 

our auditfinance committee has reviewed management’s development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

marketing costs —we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs which include advertising customer incentives and consumer incentives we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the judgment required in determining marketing costs can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to customers management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

we have recognized reserves of  1599 million  for these marketing costs as of may 31 2015  changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows 

advertising and promotion expenses totaled 3442 million  4140 million  and 4634 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our balance sheets as well as from net operating 

loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 15 “ pretax income and income taxes ” to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup management’s estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above management’s estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately  550 million  for environmental liabilities as of may 31 2015  the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy in fiscal 2013 we made an adjustment to the reserve of 45 million to increase our estimate based on expected payments 

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers’ compensation in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 

we have recognized a pension liability of  5737 million  and  4518 million  a postretirement liability of  2353 million  and  2832 million  and a workers’ compensation liability of  1001 million  and  1077 million  as of the end of fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively we also have recognized a pension asset of  205 million  and  188 million  as of the end of fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status 

we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation “the corridor” in current period expense annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when measurement is required otherwise under generally accepted accounting principles 

we recognized pension expense benefit from company plans of  09 million   59 million  and  235 million  in fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively such amounts reflect the yearend writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability of 69 million 34 million and 57 million in fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of  2679 million   2529 million  and  2164 million  in fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively we contributed  135 million   183 million  and  198 million  to our pension plans in fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  130 million  to our pension plans in fiscal 2016 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate we select a discount rate each year as of our fiscal yearend measurement date for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans the hypothetical bond 

portfolio is comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moody’s aa available at the measurement date based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 415  for fiscal 2015  405  for fiscal 2014  and 45  for fiscal 2013  we selected a discount rate of 410  for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2016  a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2015  would have resulted in a decrease of  29 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2015  a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2015  would have resulted in an increase of  890 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2015  the disproportionate impact on pension expense of a reduction of our discount rate is due to our policy of writingoff actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability immediately for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected discount rates of 410  and 415  for fiscal years 2015  and 2014  respectively 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plan’s investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 775  for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2015  pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by  87 million  we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775  to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2016  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2016  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by  87 million  

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans we determine this assumption based on our longterm plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions based on this information we selected 370  and 425  for fiscal years 2015  and 2014  respectively as the rate of compensation increase for determining our yearend pension obligation we selected 425  for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for each of fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015  would increase pension expense for our pension plans by  08 million  for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015  would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by  12 million  for the year we selected a rate of 370  for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2016  a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2016  would increase pension expense for our pension plans by  11 million  for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2016  would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by  16 million  for the year 

in october 2014 the society of actuaries retirement plan experience committee published new mortality tables and recommended their use for the measurement of us pension plan obligations with the assistance of our thirdparty actuary in measuring our pension obligations as of may 31 2015 we incorporated revised assumptions that generally reflect the mortality improvement inherent in these new tables as adjusted for experience specific to our industry 

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense of  61 million   99 million  and  88 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively we reflected liabilities of  2353 million  and  2832 million  in our balance sheets as of may 31 2015  and may 25 2014  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  237 million  to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2016  

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates also discussed above and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 365  for fiscal 2015  335  for fiscal 2014  and 39  for fiscal 2013  we have selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 35  for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2016  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 90 with the trend rate decreasing to 45 by 2023 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 



we provide workers’ compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the weightedaverage discount rate used at may 31 2015  was 216 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers’ compensation expense 

business combinations impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets and goodwill —we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets including property plant and equipment to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable we generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group no impairment is recognized if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group we writedown the asset or assets to their estimated fair values the estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group 

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands while other acquired intangible assets eg customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of definitelived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience the competitive and macroeconomic environment and our operating plans the costs of definitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 

we reduce the carrying amounts of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets 

in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

if we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks we utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital 

in fiscal 2015 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles during fiscal 2015 we recognized impairment charges of 437 million in our private brands segment to writedown various brands we also recognized impairment charges of 48 million in our consumer foods segment for our poppycock ®  brand and a 03 million impairment charge in our commercial foods segment for a small brand 

in fiscal 2014 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles we recognized impairment charges of 725 million in our consumer foods segment primarily for our chef boyardee ®  brand and a 32 million impairment charge in our private brands segment for two small brands we also recognized a 32 million impairment charge for an amortizable technology license in our corporate expenses in fiscal 2014 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

in testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test the first step of the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a riskadjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period typically four or five years and the terminal period considering expected long term growth rates and trends estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in riskadjusted discounts rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit 

if the fair value of a reporting unit determined in the first step of the evaluation is lower than its carrying value we proceed to the second step which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value in estimating the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit we must assign the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities associated with the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination ie we estimate the fair value of each asset and liability held in the reporting unit the various assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are generally not adjusted to their new estimated fair values unless impairments of any individual assets are indicated the implied goodwill is equal to the residual of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of each identifiable asset and liability within the reporting unit any excess of the carrying value of goodwill of the reporting unit over its implied fair value is recorded as impairment 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 in conjunction with our annual review for impairment we performed a qualitative analysis of goodwill for the reporting units in our consumer foods and commercial foods segments the results of the qualitative analysis did not result in further testing of impairment 

because forecasted sales and profits for the private brands segment continued to fall below our expectations relative to our previous projections throughout fiscal 2015 we performed quantitative analyses of goodwill on certain of our private brands segment reporting units in the second third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions we estimated the future cash flows of each reporting unit within the private brands segment and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate in order to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 8 and 3 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we then compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the respective historical carrying value including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value for six of our reporting units within the private brands segment throughout fiscal 2015 with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of each of these reporting units in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill of each reporting unit we recognized impairment charges for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill within each reporting unit at the respective measurement dates accordingly during fiscal 2015 we recorded charges totaling 153 billion for the impairment of goodwill in the private brands segment the following reporting units within private brands were impacted 3287 million in bars and coordinated 1951 million in cereal 1571 million in pasta 5365 million in snacks 1744 million in retail bakery and 1361 million in condiments 

during fiscal 2014 we recorded a 6022 million charge for the impairment of goodwill in the private brands segment the following reporting units within private brands were impacted 664 million in bars and coordinated 1546 million in cereal 942 million in pasta 2316 million in snacks and 554 million in retail bakery 

in the case of four reporting units within the private brands segment cereal pasta snacks and retail bakery the estimated fair value of certain amortizing intangible assets customer relationships used in step two of our impairment analysis was substantially less than the carrying value of those assets and as a result the carrying value of the cereal pasta snacks and retail bakery reporting units exceeded the estimated fair values of those reporting units even after the previously described goodwill impairment charges were recorded we assess the recoverability of these amortizing intangibles at the segment level and expect to recover the carrying value over their remaining lives on an undiscounted basis and accordingly no impairments were required to be recognized 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we concluded that due to a decline in estimated future cash flows there was an indicator of impairment for certain property plant and equipment within the private brands segment as a result we reviewed the longlived assets for impairment and recorded a 137 million  impairment charge within the private brands segment the impairment was measured based upon an estimated disposal value for the related production facility 

following the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2015 the carrying value of goodwill in our private brands reporting units included 2693 million  for cereal 5882 million  for pasta 2765 million  for snacks and 5355 million  for retail bakery all of the goodwill for the bars and coordinated and condiments reporting units was impaired as of the end of fiscal 2015 if the future performance of one or more of the reporting units within the private brands segment falls short of our expectations or if there are significant changes in riskadjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions we could be required to recognize additional material impairment charges in future periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2015  and 2014  were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies these fluctuations impacted all reporting segments 

commodity market risk 

we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions 

interest rate risk 

we may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt during fiscal 2014 we entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior longterm debt instruments maturing in fiscal 2019 and 2020 during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we terminated these interest rate swap contracts 

as of may 31 2015  and may 25 2014  the fair value of our long term debt including current installments was estimated at 83 billion and 95 billion respectively based on current market rates provided primarily by outside investment advisors as of may 31 2015  and may 25 2014  a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 4286 million and 5539 million respectively while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 4795 million and 6274 million respectively 

foreign currency risk 

in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 

valueatrisk var 

we employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk including valueatrisk var models we perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions we use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of var that is used to monitor our daily risk the purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices our model uses a 95 confidence level accordingly in any given one day time period losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5 of the time we include commodity swaps futures and options and foreign exchange forwards swaps and options in this calculation the following table provides an overview of our average daily var for our energy agriculture foreign exchange and other commodities for fiscal years 2015  and 2014  other commodities below consist primarily of forward and option contracts for a commodities index which includes items such as agricultural commodities energy commodities and metals the other commodities category below may also include items such as packaging andor livestock

general 

the following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments 

conagra foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded private branded and valueadded consumer food as well as foodservice items and ingredients we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources from time to time we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption 

we experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets our food items compete with widely advertised wellknown branded food as well as private branded and customized food items some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related food items are sold some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

many of our facilities and food items we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 17  of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  

at may 25 2014  conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 32800  employees primarily in the united states approximately 41  of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 16  are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during fiscal 2015  we believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

 we may not fully realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies from the acquisition of ralcorp holdings inc or in the expected time frame 

the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of ralcorp holdings inc or ralcorp which we refer to as the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies from the acquisition 

our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of ralcorp there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as ralcorp members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this continuing integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the ongoing integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the process our business could suffer there can be no assurance that we will successfully or costeffectively integrate the ralcorp business the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we are able to fully integrate ralcorp successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we expect from this integration and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all for example we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs moreover we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration while certain expenses will continue to be incurred to achieve cost synergies such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to or delays in integrating the businesses 

our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

as of may 25 2014 we had a substantial amount of debt including 3912 billion of senior notes that we issued and a 900 million term loan that we entered into in connection with the acquisition we have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur substantial additional debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 

 additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper in the event of a default the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our supply chain and administrative efficiency plan or scae plan 

during fiscal 2014 we announced our supply chain and administrative efficiency plan or scae plan which was an expansion of the scope of the plan to integrate ralcorp the scae plan includes steps to optimize the entire organization’s supply chain network and to improve selling general and administrative effectiveness and efficiencies as well as our continuing evaluation of plans for the integration of ralcorp and related restructuring activities the successful design and implementation of the scae plan presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the scae plan may not advance our business strategy as expected events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the scae plan our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the scae plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the complexity of the scae plan will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the scae plan these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from existing core businesses integrating financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected 

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material packaging and energy costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume 

reduced margins and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains wheat corn and oats oils beef pork poultry and energy changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

the food industry is highly competitive our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases we sell branded private brand and customized food products as well as commercially branded foods and ingredients our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors in addition when branded competitors focus on price and promotion the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

significant private brand competitive activity can lead to volatility in results and margin compression 

private brand customer buying decisions are often based on a periodic bidding process our sales volume may decrease significantly if our offer is too high and we lose the ability to sell private brand products through these channels even temporarily alternatively we risk reducing our margins if our offer is successful but below our desired price either of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us 

during fiscal 2014 our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 17  of our net revenues there can be no assurance that walmart stores inc and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes government action or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have continued to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business these consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their store brand products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label or store brand competition our profitability could decline 

consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration and other national state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act or the fdca and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as previously disclosed among the matters outstanding during fiscal 2014 related to the companys 2007 peanut butter recall is an ongoing investigation by the us attorneys office in georgia and the consumer protection branch of the department of justice in fiscal 2011 we received formal requests from the us attorneys office in georgia seeking a variety of records and information related to the operations of our peanut butter manufacturing facility in sylvester georgia we have been and continue 

to be engaged in ongoing discussions with the us attorney’s office and the department of justice in regard to the investigation we are pursuing a negotiated resolution which we believe will likely involve a misdemeanor criminal disposition under the food drug  cosmetics act 

any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities the failure to achieve our goals with respect to sodium or saturated fat our research and development efforts or our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the us and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could affect our net operating revenues 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as corn wheat and potatoes we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular 

increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and potential disruption cyber attacks security problems and expanding social media vehicles present new risks 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results in addition there is a risk of business interruption litigation risks and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information 

the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about the company on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation in addition the disclosure of nonpublic company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

in connection with ralcorps separation of its post brand cereals business post agreed to indemnify ralcorp for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that posts ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement that ralcorp entered into with post in connection with the separation of ralcorps post brand cereals business post agreed to indemnify ralcorp for certain liabilities third parties may seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that post agreed to retain or assume and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from post will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that post will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in addition even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from post any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

as of may 25 2014 we had goodwill of  784 billion  and other intangibles of  321 billion  the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as the inability to quickly replace lost comanufacturing business increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry ebitda multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and   negatively impact our net worth 

following the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2014 the carrying value of goodwill in our private brands reporting units included 3287 million for bars and coordinated 4644 million for cereal 7521 million for pasta 8162 million for snacks 7171 million for retail bakery and 1361 million for condiments if the future performance of one or more of the reporting units within the private brands segment falls short of our expectations or if there are significant changes in riskadjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions we could be required to recognize additional material impairment charges in future periods 

the termination or expiration of current comanufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations 

our businesses periodically enter into comanufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products the terms of these agreements vary but are generally for relatively short periods of time volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the products life cycle product promotions alternative production capacity and other factors none of which are under our direct control our future ability to enter into comanufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed and a decrease in current comanufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume 

ardent mills may not achieve the benefits that are anticipated from the joint venture 

the benefits that are expected to result from the recently formed ardent mills joint venture will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated cost synergies in the transaction ardent mills ability to successfully integrate the conagra mills and horizon milling businesses and its ability to successfully manage the joint venture on a goingforward basis it is not certain that we will realize these benefits at all and if we do it is not certain how long it will take to achieve these benefits if for example we are unable to achieve the anticipated cost savings or if there are unforeseen integration costs or if ardent mills is unable to operate the joint venture smoothly in the future the financial performance of the joint venture may be negatively affected 

if we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected in addition we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers any of these factors could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a party to various environmental proceedings and litigation primarily related to our acquisition of beatrice company “beatrice” in fiscal 1991 as a result of the acquisition of beatrice and the significant preacquisition contingencies of the beatrice business and its former subsidiaries our consolidated postacquisition financial statements reflect liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies these include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by beatrice prior to its acquisition by us the litigation includes suits against a number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers including conagra grocery products company a wholly owned subsidiary of the company “conagra grocery products” and the company as alleged successors to w p fuller co a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by beatrice until 1967 although decisions favorable to us have been rendered in rhode island new jersey wisconsin and ohio we remain a defendant in active suits in illinois and california the illinois suit seeks classwide relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of lead in blood in california a number of cities and counties have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the alleged public nuisance on september 23 2013 a trial of the california case concluded in the superior court of california for the county of santa clara and on january 27 2014 the court entered judgment against conagra grocery products and two other defendants which orders the creation of a california abatement fund in the amount of 115 billion liability is joint and several the company believes conagra grocery products did not inherit any liabilities of w p fuller co the company will continue to vigorously defend itself in this case and has appealed the judgment to the court of appeal of the state of california sixth appellate district the company expects the appeal process will last several years the absence of any linkage between conagra grocery products and w p fuller co is a critical issue that the company will continue to advance throughout the appeals process it is not possible to estimate exposure in this case or the remaining case in illinois which is based on different legal theories if ultimately necessary the company will look to its insurance policies for coverage its carriers are on notice however the company cannot absolutely assure that the final resolution of this matter will not a have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the environmental proceedings associated with beatrice include litigation and administrative proceedings involving beatrices status as a potentially responsible party at 36 superfund proposed superfund or stateequivalent sites these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of beatrice that used or produced petroleum pesticides fertilizers dyes inks solvents pcbs acids lead sulfur tannery wastes andor other contaminants beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 34 of these sites reserves for these matters have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup the known volumetric contribution of beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites the reserves for beatricerelated environmental matters totaled 616 million as of may 25 2014 a majority of which relates to the superfund and stateequivalent sites referenced above we expect expenditures for beatricerelated environmental matters to continue for up to 18 years 

we are a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of our ongoing business operations among these there are lawsuits claims and matters related to the february 2007 recall of our peanut butter products among the matters outstanding during fiscal 2014 related to the peanut butter recall is an ongoing investigation by the us attorneys office in georgia and the consumer protection branch of the department of justice in fiscal 2011 we received formal requests from the us attorneys office in georgia seeking a variety of records and information related to the operations of our peanut butter manufacturing facility in sylvester georgia these requests relate to the june 2007 execution of a search warrant at our facility following the february 2007 recall during fiscal 2013 and 2012 we recognized charges of 75 million and 175 million respectively in connection with this matter during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we reduced our accrual by 67 million in connection with ongoing discussions with the us attorney’s office and the department of justice in regard to the investigation we are pursuing a negotiated resolution which we believe will likely involve a misdemeanor criminal disposition under the food drug  cosmetics act after taking into account liabilities recorded for these matters we believe the ultimate resolution of this matter should not have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions results of operations or liquidity

segment review 

as a result of the ralcorp acquisition we implemented organizational changes during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 that resulted in new reporting segments we began reporting our operations in three reporting segments consumer foods commercial foods and private brands we believe this recent operating structure will enhance our focus on profitability coordinated business execution and resource allocation across our business prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the revised segment presentation prior to this change in organizational structure we had four operating and reportable segments 

consumer foods 

the consumer foods reporting segment includes branded food sold in various retail channels primarily in north america our food products are found in a variety of categories meals entrees condiments sides snacks and desserts throughout grocery and convenience stores across frozen refrigerated and shelfstable temperature classes 

the consumer foods reporting segment no longer includes results for store brands store brands are now part of the recently created private brands segment or foodservice results the foodservice business is now part of the commercial foods segment the consumer foods reporting segment now includes additional international sales which were previously part of the ralcorp food group segment 

commercial foods 

the commercial foods reporting segment includes commercially branded and private branded food and ingredients which are sold primarily to commercial foodservice food manufacturing and industrial customers the segments primary food items include frozen potato and sweet potato items and a variety of vegetable spice and frozen bakery goods which are sold under brands such as lamb weston ®  and spicetec flavors  seasonings ®  

the commercial foods reporting segment now includes foodservice results which were previously part of the consumer foods segment as well as frozen bakery foodservice results which were previously part of the ralcorp frozen bakery products segment our milling business was included in the commercial foods segment for the periods covered by this report but was contributed to ardent mills shortly after the end of fiscal 2014

the recently created private brands reporting segment includes a significant portion of results from the former ralcorp businesses and the store brands results which were previously part of the consumer foods segment 

presentation of derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results 

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives except those related to our milling operations see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized 

in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings 

the following table presents the net derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions under this methodology 



as of may 25 2014  the cumulative amount of net derivative gains from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was 269 million  this amount reflected net gains of 257 million  incurred during the fiscal year ended may 25 2014  as well as net gains of 12 million  incurred prior to fiscal 2014  based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify to segment operating results gains of 265 million  and 04 million  to segment operating results in fiscal 2015  and 2016  and thereafter respectively 

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

net sales 



overall our net sales increased  228 billion  to  1770 billion  in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013 primarily related to the acquisition of ralcorp 

consumer foods net sales for fiscal 2014  were  732 billion  a decrease of  2359 million  or 3  compared to fiscal 2013  results reflected a 3 decrease in volume performance and a 1 decrease due to the impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by a 1 increase in pricemix volume performance from our base businesses for fiscal 2014 was impacted negatively by competitor promotional activity significant slotting and promotion investments related to new product launches particularly in the first quarter also weighed heavily on net sales in fiscal 2014 in addition certain shipments planned for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were shifted to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as a result of change in timing of retailer promotions and this negatively impacted volume performance 

sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands including bertolli ®  hunts ®  odoms ®  libbys ®  reddiwip ®  rotel ®  slim jim ®  and swiss miss ®  grew in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  significant brands whose products experienced sales declines in fiscal 2014  include act ii ®  banquet ®   chef boyardee ®  healthy choice ®   marie callenders ®  orville redenbachers ®  snack pack ®  and wesson ®  a significant portion of the overall volume decline was driven by healthy choice orville redenbacher’s and chef boyardee which collectively have annual sales in excess of 1 billion the company has product and promotion changes as well as refinements to consumer communication under way which are expected to gradually improve the volume and profit performance of these brands throughout fiscal 2015 

commercial foods net sales were  619 billion  in fiscal 2014  an increase of  1242 million  or 2  compared to fiscal 2013  results for fiscal 2014 reflected a 3 benefit from the acquisition of the frozen bakery business of ralcorp in january 2013 this increase was partially offset by the negative impact of the passthrough of 942 million of lower wheat prices in the milling 

business results for fiscal 2014  also reflected increased volume of 2 in the segments lamb weston specialty potato products business driven by increased sales to international customers partially offset by lower pricemix sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to international customers were favorably impacted by increased promotional activity and accelerated orders due to concerns about the effect of a potential external labor dispute on west coast exports sales volume in the foodservice business decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to industry trends 

private brands net sales for fiscal 2014 were  420 billion  the increase of  239 billion  represents a full year of ownership of the legacy ralcorp business in fiscal 2014 compared to four months in fiscal 2013 while sales and profits for private brands continued to be softer than expected through fiscal 2014 the company is currently focused on and has recently organized to improve sales force coverage pricing strategies customer service levels and plant efficiencies we have made pricing concessions to protect volumes as we address these challenges the company expects improved net sales and operating profit from private brands over time

sga expenses totaled  277 billion  for fiscal 2014 an increase of  6305 million  compared to fiscal 2013 the increase in overall sga occurred as a result of the additional eight months of sga expenses for the ralcorp business as well as the following changes from our base business

private brands operating loss for fiscal 2014 was  3750 million  compared to an operating profit for fiscal 2013 of  1231 million  the majority of our private brands segment is comprised of the former ralcorp business the increase in net sales discussed above reflects the impact of the ralcorp acquisition operating profits have been below expectations due to sales force supply chain and pricing actions as well as cost challenges associated with integration and business transition we expect these margin pressures to continue for the next few quarters as a result of the deliberate pricing concessions made in previous quarters 

to improve customer relationships and remain competitive in the marketplace during fiscal 2014 in fiscal 2014 we recognized charges of 6054 million in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets within the private brands segment also included in the operating loss for fiscal 2014 were 359 million of charges in connection with our restructuring plans included in the results of the private brands operating profit in fiscal 2013 was 136 million of incremental cost of goods sold due to the fair value adjustment to inventory resulting from acquisition accounting based on the challenges in the private brands segment in fiscal 2014 and the gradual nature of the anticipated recovery from fiscal 2014 earnings levels the company’s current profit projections for the private brands segment are below original plans for the next several years despite continued expectations for achievement of strong costrelated synergies 

interest expense net 

in fiscal 2014  net interest expense was  3790 million  an increase of  1034 million  or 38  from fiscal 2013 the increase reflects the issuance of 3975 billion of senior debt outstanding borrowings of 900 million under a term loan facility and 7160 million of senior debt that was exchanged in january 2013 in financing the ralcorp acquisition in addition to the issuance of 7500 million of senior notes in september 2012 interest expense in fiscal 2014 and 2013 reflected a net benefit of 121 million and 86 million respectively primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable 

income taxes 

our income tax expense was  2982 million  and  4007 million  in fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings was 49  for fiscal 2014 and 34  in fiscal 2013 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 reflects the incurrence of an impairment of intangible assets 5292 million of which was nondeductible goodwill as well as the benefit of normal recurring income tax credits and deductions some of which expired on december 31 2013 the fiscal 2014 effective tax rate also included a change in estimate related to tax methods used for certain international sales favorable tax adjustments resulting from changes in legal structure and state tax filing positions resolution of foreign tax matters that were previously reserved the effect of a law change in mexico requiring deconsolidation for tax reporting purposes and the resolution of certain income tax matters related to dispositions of foreign operations in prior years the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 reflects the incurrence of various nondeductible transactionrelated expenses as well as a reduced domestic manufacturing deduction benefit in connection with the acquisition of ralcorp the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate also included favorable tax adjustments resulting from the implementation of the 2012 american taxpayer relief act during fiscal 2013

private brands segment operating profit for fiscal 2013 was  1231 million  an increase of  279 million  compared to fiscal 2012 included in the results of the private brands segment operating profit in fiscal 2013 was 136 million of incremental cost of goods sold due to the fair value adjustment to inventory resulting from acquisition accounting 

interest expense net 

in fiscal 2013 net interest expense was  2756 million  an increase of  716 million  or 35  from fiscal 2012 the increase reflects the issuance of 3975 billion of senior debt borrowings of 15 billion under a term loan facility and 7160 million of senior debt that was exchanged in january 2013 in financing the ralcorp acquisition in addition to the issuance of 7500 million of senior notes in september 2012 interest expense in fiscal 2013 and 2012 reflected a net benefit of 86 million and 89 million respectively primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable these hedges were terminated in fiscal 2011 

income taxes 

our income tax expense was  4007 million  and  1917 million  in fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings was 34  for fiscal 2013 and 29  in fiscal 2012 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 reflects the incurrence of various nondeductible transactionrelated expenses as well as a reduced domestic manufacturing deduction benefit in connection with the acquisition of ralcorp the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 is reflective of the benefit of normal recurring income tax credits and deductions combined with a lower pretax level of earnings due in large part to the impact of the writeoff of 3969 million of actuarial losses under the method of accounting for pension benefits adopted in fiscal 2012 as well as a 586 million nontaxable gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held noncontrolling equity interest in atfl in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in that company the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate also included favorable tax adjustments resulting from the implementation of the 2012 american taxpayer relief act during fiscal 2013 while the fiscal 2012 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the prior expiration of these tax benefits during fiscal 2012 in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we received an adverse mexican tax court ruling and recorded a reserve of 40 million 

equity method investment earnings 

we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers our share of earnings from our equity method investments was 375 million 18 million in the consumer foods segment and 357 million in the commercial foods segment and 449 million 49 million in the consumer foods segment and 400 million in the commercial foods segment in fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease in equity method investment earnings in the commercial foods segment were a result of higher input costs for a foreign potato processing venture in addition to a charge of 21 million reflecting the yearend writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of the pension liability 

results of discontinued operations 

our discontinued operations generated an aftertax loss of  07 million  in fiscal 2013 and an aftertax gain of  65 million  in fiscal 2012 

earnings per share 

fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 185  fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share were 112  including 110  per diluted share from continuing operations and income of 002  per diluted share from discontinued operations see “items impacting comparability”  above as several significant items affected the comparability of yearoveryear results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity and capital 

our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives if necessary we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories less accounts payable accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets we increased our indebtedness significantly during fiscal 2013 as a result of the ralcorp acquisition we have been focused on repaying a significant portion of our indebtedness subsequent to the ralcorp acquisition we are committed to maintaining an investment grade rating 

at may 25 2014  we had a 15 billion revolving credit facility the facility is scheduled to mature in september 2018 the facility has historically been used principally as a backup facility for our commercial paper program as of may 25 2014  there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility the facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 70 of our consolidated capital base in the four quarters commencing on january 29 2014 and 65 thereafter and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 175 to 10 as of may 25 2014  we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

as of may 25 2014  we had 1370 million outstanding under our commercial paper program the highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2014 was 3950 million 

in fiscal 2013 we borrowed 15 billion under our term loan facility we are required to repay borrowings under the term loan facility in equal installments of 25 per quarter beginning june 1 2013 with the remainder of the borrowings to be paid on the maturity date unless prepaid in accordance with the terms of the term loan facility we may prepay borrowings without premium or penalty as of may 25 2014  we had  9000 million  outstanding under the term loan facility the term loan facility matures on january 29 2018 the term loan facility interest rate is calculated based on libor plus 175 net proceeds were used for the acquisition of ralcorp the term loan facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 70 of our consolidated capital base in the four quarters commencing on january 29 2014 and 65 thereafter and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 175 to 10 as of may 25 2014  we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

as of the end of fiscal 2014  our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult 

we repurchase our shares of common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board of directors in december 2011 the companys board of directors approved a 7500 million increase to our share repurchase authorization under the share repurchase authorization we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years depending on market conditions and other factors and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions the authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time we repurchased 29 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 1000 million  under this program in fiscal 2014 the companys total remaining share repurchase authorization as of may 25 2014  was 1819 million 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed the sale of the assets of the lightlife business for 547 million in cash

subsequent to the end of fiscal 2014 we received 5653 million in cash upon the closing of the ardent mills joint venture which included 1624 million  associated with the sale of three flour milling facilities at the end of fiscal 2014 

subsequent to our fiscal year end in june 2014 we repaid 3500 million of the principal amount outstanding under the term loan facility with a portion of the proceeds received in connection with the formation of ardent mills we paid the remaining outstanding principal balance of 5500 million under the term loan facility in july 2014 and terminated the facility with a portion of the proceeds from the formation of ardent mills and approximately 330 million of borrowings under our commercial paper program 

cash flows 

in fiscal 2014  we used  08 million  of cash which was the net result of 155 billion  generated from operating activities  5141 million  used in investing activities 103 billion  used in financing activities and a decrease of  38 million  in cash due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled  155 billion  in fiscal 2014  as compared to  141 billion  generated in fiscal 2013  the increase in operating cash is largely due to the full year of results of the former ralcorp business in fiscal 2014  as compared to four months of results in fiscal 2013 operating cash outflows for interest payments increased 1798 million to 3957 million in fiscal 2014 as a result of the increase in debt from the ralcorp acquisitionwe contributed 183 million  and 198 million  to our pension plans in fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively in fiscal 2013  decreases in consumer foods inventories excluding impacts of acquisitions due to more stable commodity prices and utilization of prior physical positions were offset by increases in our commercial foods segment resulting from higher wheat prices and increased potato harvest yields also in fiscal 2013 tax related cash flow benefits of 1801 million realized from lower current income tax payments as a result of paying off ralcorp debt were largely offset by outflows of 1301 million resulting from costs associated with the ralcorp acquisition and 425 million in interest accrued by ralcorp prior to the acquisition which was subsequently paid in fiscal 2014 cash outflows included amounts associated with ralcorp integration costs of 472 million and previously accrued acquisition related costs primarily severance and retention costs of 244 million we paid larger incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2014  earned in fiscal 2013  than in the first quarter of fiscal 2013  earned in fiscal 2012 

cash used in investing activities totaled 5141 million  in fiscal 2014  versus 547 billion  in fiscal 2013  investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2014  consisted primarily of capital expenditures of  6024 million  which increased from fiscal 2013 due to the increases associated with the former ralcorp businesses as well as several significant planned plant expansions and improvements additionally we purchased certain frozen dessert production assets for 399 million in fiscal 2014 investing activities in fiscal 2013  consisted primarily of the purchase of ralcorp for  475 billion  net of cash acquired capital expenditures of  4537 million  and the acquisition of the pf changs ®  and bertolli ®  brands frozen meal business from unilever for 2669 million  in cash investing activities of discontinued operations generated 867 million  in fiscal 2014 primarily from the sale of assets of the lightlife and medallion foods businesses 

cash used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled 103 billion  in fiscal 2014 compared with cash generated from financing activities of 413 billion  in fiscal 2013 in fiscal 2014 we decreased our total debt by 6124 million including the repayment of 5000 million aggregate principal amount of our 5875 senior notes upon maturity in april 2014 in fiscal 2013 we issued longterm debt that generated 622 billion in cash and repaid 207 billion in debt primarily 144 billion paid for principal and contractual amounts on ralcorp notes tendered in connection with the ralcorp acquisition and prepayment of 6000 million of the term loan facility in conjunction with the ralcorp acquisition we issued common stock for 2692 million in net cash proceeds in fiscal 2013 during fiscal 2014  and 2013  we paid dividends of 4209 million  and 4007 million  respectively in fiscal 2014  and 2013  we repurchased 1000 million  and 2450 million  respectively of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program amounts generated from employee stock option exercise proceeds and issuance of other stock awards were 1037 million  and 2744 million  in fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of 1831 million  at may 25 2014  and 1839 million  at may 26 2013  of which 1463 million at may 25 2014  and 1664 million at may 26 2013  was held in foreign countries the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of foreign earnings intended for permanent reinvestment outside the united states with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and future foreign investments no related tax liability has been accrued as of may 25 2014  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the companys foreign subsidiaries repaid 929 million of intercompany notes to domestic subsidiaries these loan repayments did not result in significant additional income taxes in addition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 certain of the companys foreign subsidiaries extended short term loans to domestic entities totaling 378 million such loans were repaid in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 at may 25 2014  management does not intend to permanently repatriate 

additional foreign cash any future decision to repatriate foreign cash could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes it is not practicable to determine the amount of any such deferred tax liability at this time 

 we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 to be approximately 600 million 

management believes that existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs planned capital expenditures and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use offbalance sheet arrangements eg leases accounted for as operating leases where sound business principles warrant their use we also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business these are described further in “ obligations and commitments ” below 

variable interest entities not consolidated 

we have variable interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities but for which we are not the primary beneficiary we do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities 

we hold a 500  interest in lamb weston rdo a potato processing venture we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston rdo we receive a fee for these services based on a percentage of the net sales of the venture we reflect the value of our ownership interest in this venture in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets based upon the equity method of accounting the balance of our investment was 126 million  and 152 million  at may 25 2014  and may 26 2013  respectively representing our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this venture the capital structure of lamb weston rdo includes owners equity of 254 million  and term borrowings from banks of 428 million  as of may 25 2014  we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this venture 

we lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities the lease agreements with these entities include fixedprice purchase options for the assets being leased representing our only variable interest in these lessor entities these leases are accounted for as operating leases and accordingly there are no material assets or liabilities associated with these entities included in our consolidated balance sheets we have no material exposure to loss from our variable interests in these entities we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities in making this determination we have considered among other items the terms of the lease agreements the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased and the capital structure of the lessor entities 

obligations and commitments 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements debt agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as takeorpay contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available of these items debt and capital lease obligations which totaled 89 billion as of may 25 2014  were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations which totaled 29 billion as of may 25 2014  were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of may 25 2014  was as follows 



1  amount includes open purchase orders and agreements some of which are not legally binding andor may be cancellable such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year 

we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our longterm debt and capital lease obligations the weighted average coupon interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 25 2014  was approximately 42 

the operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by noncancellable sublease rentals of 323 million 

we own a 4999 interest in lamb weston bsw llc lamb weston bsw a potato processing venture with ochoa ag unlimited foods inc ochoa we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston bsw under certain circumstances we could be required to compensate ochoa for lost profits resulting from significant production shortfalls production shortfalls commencing on june 1 2018 or on an earlier date under certain circumstances we have a contractual right to purchase the remaining equity interest in lamb weston bsw from ochoa the call option we are currently subject to a contractual obligation to purchase all of ochoas equity investment in lamb weston bsw at the option of ochoa the put option the purchase prices under the call option and the put option the options are based on the book value of ochoas equity interest at the date of exercise as modified by an agreedupon rate of return for the holding period of the investment balance the agreedupon rate of return varies depending on the circumstances under which any of the options are exercised as of may 25 2014  the price at which ochoa had the right to put its equity interest to us was 419 million  this amount which is presented within other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets is not included in the contractual obligations table above as the payment is contingent upon the exercise of the put option by ochoa and the eventual occurrence and timing of such exercise is uncertain 

as part of our ongoing operations we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event eg guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets a summary of our commitments including commitments associated with equity method investments as of may 25 2014  was as follows 



in certain limited situations we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity we guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations resulting from the 2002 divestiture of our fresh beef and pork operations the remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed two years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was 54 million as of may 25 2014  

we are a party to various potato supply agreements under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements we have guaranteed repayment of shortterm bank loans of the potato suppliers under certain conditions at may 25 2014  the amount of 

supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was 344 million included in the table above we have not established a liability for these guarantees as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote 

we were a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing company where we had guaranteed under certain conditions repayment of a secured loan the secured loan of this onion products supplier to the onion products suppliers lender the amount of our guarantee was 250 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we received notice from the lender that the onion products supplier had defaulted on the secured loan and we exercised our option to purchase the secured loan from the lender for 408 million thereby assuming firstpriority secured rights to the underlying collateral for the amount of the secured loan and cancelling our guarantee the onion products supplier filed for bankruptcy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we acquired ownership and all rights to the collateral consisting of agricultural land and a processing facility during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we recognized an impairment charge of 102 million in our commercial foods segment to reduce the carrying amount of the collateral to its estimated fair value based upon updated appraisals during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recognized an additional impairment charge of 89 million in our commercial foods segment to reduce the carrying amount of the plant assets to their estimated fair value based upon expected sales proceeds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we sold the agricultural land and recognized a gain of 51 million in our commercial foods segment based on our estimate of the value of the processing facility we expect to recover the remaining carrying value through our sale of this asset 

federal income tax credits were generated related to our sweet potato production facility in delhi louisiana third parties invested in certain of these income tax credits we have guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income tax credits over their statutory lives through fiscal 2017 in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or reduced the face value of the income tax credits was 267 million as of may 25 2014  we believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax credits is remote and therefore we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee 

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 25 2014  was 849 million  the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 25 2014  that if recognized would impact our effective tax rate was 508 million  recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 

 critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management 

our auditfinance committee has reviewed management’s development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

marketing costs —we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs which include advertising customer incentives and consumer incentives we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the judgment required in determining marketing costs can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to customers management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

we have recognized reserves of approximately  1694 million  for these marketing costs as of may 25 2014  changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows 

advertising and promotion expenses totaled  4174 million   4663 million  and  3623 million  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in 

evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 14 “ pretax income and income taxes ” to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup management’s estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above management’s estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately  630 million  for environmental liabilities as of may 25 2014  the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy historically the underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary 

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers’ compensation in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time we had recognized a pension liability of  4518 million  and  4808 million  a postretirement liability of  2832 million  and  3027 million  and a workers’ compensation liability of  1077 million  and  1051 million  as of the end of fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively we also had recognized a pension asset of  188 million  and  66 million  as of the end of fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status 

we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation “the corridor” in current period expense annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when measurement is required otherwise under generally accepted accounting principles 

we recognized pension expense from company plans of  59 million   235 million  and  4218 million  in fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively such amounts reflect the yearend writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of  2529 million   2164 million  and  1960 million  in fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively we contributed  185 million   198 million  and  3264 million  to our pension plans in fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately  129 million  to our pension plans in fiscal 2015 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate we select a discount rate each year as of our fiscal yearend measurement date for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans the hypothetical bond portfolio is 

comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moody’s aa available at the measurement date based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 405  for fiscal 2014  45  for fiscal 2013  and 53  for fiscal 2012  we selected a discount rate of 415  for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2015  a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2014  would have resulted in a decrease of  18 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2014  a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2014  would have resulted in an increase of  73 million  in our pension expense for fiscal 2014  for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected discount rates of 415  and 405  for fiscal years 2014  and 2013  respectively 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plan’s investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 775  for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2014  pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2014  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by  83 million  we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775  to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2015  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by  87 million  

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans we determine this assumption based on our longterm plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions based on this information we selected 425  for fiscal years 2014  and 2013  as the rate of compensation increase for determining our yearend pension obligation we selected 425  for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for each of fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2014  would increasedecrease pension expense for our pension plans by  09 million  for the year we selected a rate of 425  for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2015  a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by 08 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by 12 million for the year 

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense of 99 million 88 million and 78 million in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively we reflected liabilities of 2832 million and 3027 million in our balance sheets as of may 25 2014  and may 26 2013  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 255 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2015  

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 335 for fiscal 2014  39 for fiscal 2013  and 43 for fiscal 2012  we have selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 365 for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2015  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2013 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 100 with the trend rate decreasing to 50 by 2022 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 



we provide workers’ compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the weightedaverage discount rate used at may 25 2014  was 227 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers’ compensation expense 

business combinations impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets and goodwill —we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any 

excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands while other acquired intangible assets eg customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of definitelived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience the competitive and macroeconomic environment and our operating plans the costs of definitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 

we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets identifiable intangible assets and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets 

in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

if we determine to perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks we utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital as the calculated fair value of our other identifiable intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying value of these assets a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge 

in fiscal 2014 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles we recognized impairment charges of 725 million in our consumer foods segment primarily for our chef boyardee ®  brand and a 32 million impairment charge in our private brands segment for two small brands we also recognized a 32 million impairment charge for an amortizable technology license in our corporate expenses in fiscal 2014 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

in testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment 

is more likely than not we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test the first step of the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a riskadjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period typically four or five years and the terminal period considering expected long term growth rates and trends estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in riskadjusted discounts rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit 

if the fair value of a reporting unit determined in the first step of the evaluation is lower than its carrying value we proceed to the second step which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value in estimating the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit we must assign the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities associated with the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the carrying value of goodwill of the reporting unit over its implied fair value is recorded as impairment 

we implemented organizational changes during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 that resulted in new reporting segments as a result we reassigned goodwill to the new reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach and performed a goodwill impairment analysis which did not identify any potential impairments 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 in conjunction with our annual review for impairment we performed a qualitative analysis of goodwill for each of the reporting units in our segments because sales and profits for private brands continued to fall below our expectations throughout fiscal 2014 and following preparation of plans for the business for fiscal 2015 we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill of our private brands segment estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions we estimated the future cash flows of each reporting unit within the private brands segment and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate in order to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of approximately 83 and 3 respectively to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows we then compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the respective historical carrying value including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value for five of our reporting units within the private brands segment with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of each of these reporting units in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill of each reporting unit we recognized impairment charges for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the historical carrying value of goodwill within each reporting unit accordingly during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a 6022 million charge for the impairment of goodwill the following reporting units within private brands were impacted 664 million in bars and coordinated 1546 million in cereal 942 million in pasta 2316 million in snacks and 554 million in retail bakery 

in the case of three of our reporting units within the private brands segment pasta snacks and retail bakery the estimated fair value of certain amortizing intangible assets customer relationships used in step two of our impairment analysis was substantially less than the carrying value of those assets and as a result the the carrying value of the pasta snacks and retail bakery reporting units exceeded the estimated fair values of those reporting units even after the previously described goodwill impairment charges were recorded the carrying value of the private brands amortizing intangible assets are expected to be recovered over their remaining lives on an undiscounted basis and accordingly no impairments were required to be recognized 

following the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2014 the carrying value of goodwill in our private brands reporting units included 3287 million for bars and coordinated 4644 million for cereal 7521 million for pasta 8162 million for snacks 7171 million for retail bakery and 1361 million for condiments if the future performance of one or more of the reporting units within the private brands segment falls short of our expectations or if there are significant changes in riskadjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions we could be required to recognize additional material impairment charges in future periods 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in july 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update asu 201311 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists  which states that entities should present the unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of the deferred tax asset for a net operating loss nol or similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward rather than as a liability when the uncertain tax position would reduce the nol or other carryforward under the tax law no new disclosures are necessary this asu will be effective for the first interim reporting period in fiscal 2015 

in april 2014 the fasb issued asu 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of components of an entity  which updates the definition of discontinued operations from current us gaap going forward only those disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results will be reported as discontinued operations in the financial statements currently a component of an entity that is a reportable segment an operating segment a reporting unit a subsidiary or an asset group is eligible for discontinued operations presentation additionally the existing condition that the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction has been removed the effective date for the revised standard is for applicable transactions that occur within annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2014 early adoption is permitted but only for disposals or classifications as held for sale that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance the company intends to early adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 this will result in the presentation of historical results of our milling business prior to the creation of the ardent mills joint venture as discontinued operations beginning in fiscal 2015 such accounting treatment is precluded prior to the adoption of the new accounting standard 

in may 2014 after our fiscal year end the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap when it becomes effective the new standard is effective for the company in our fiscal year 2018 early application is not permitted the company is evaluating the effect that asu 201409 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method the company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies these fluctuations impacted all reporting segments 

commodity market risk 

we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions to a lesser extent we engage in wheat trading activities in the milling operations of our commercial foods segment these trading activities are limited in terms of maximum dollar exposure as measured by a dollarsatrisk methodology and monitored to ensure compliance 

interest rate risk 

from time to time we use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt during fiscal 2010 we entered into interest rate swap contracts used to effectively convert the interest rate of our senior longterm debt instruments maturing in fiscal 2014 from fixed to variable during fiscal 2011 we terminated these interest rate swap contracts as a result of this termination we received proceeds of 315 million the cumulative adjustment to the fair value of the debt instruments being hedged was included in longterm debt and was amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of the debt instruments through fiscal 2014 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior longterm debt instruments maturing in fiscal 2019 and 2020 the net notional amount of these interest rate derivatives at may 25 2014  was 5000 million 2500 million for each maturity the maximum potential loss associated with these interest rate swap contracts from a hypothetical increase of 1 in interest rates is approximately 292 million any such gain or loss to the extent the hedge is effective are offset by fair value adjustments to the debt instruments being hedged 

as of may 25 2014 and may 26 2013 the fair value of our long term debt including current installments was estimated at 95 billion and 102 billion respectively based on current market rates provided primarily by outside investment advisors as of may 25 2014  and may 26 2013 a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 5539 million and 6303 million respectively while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our longterm debt by approximately 6274 million and 7065 million respectively 

foreign currency risk 

in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 

valueatrisk var 

we employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk including valueatrisk var models we perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions we use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of var that is used to monitor our daily risk the purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices our model uses a 95 confidence level accordingly in any given one day time period losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5 of the time we include commodity swaps futures and options and foreign exchange forwards swaps and options in this calculation the following table provides an overview of our average daily var for our energy agriculture foreign exchange and other commodities for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 other commodities below consist primarily of forward and option contracts for a commodities index the market price of which is closely correlated with that of our commodity inputs this index includes items such as agricultural commodities energy commodities and metals the other commodities category below may also include items such as packaging andor livestock

general 

the following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments 

conagra foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded private brand and valueadded consumer products as well as foodservice products and ingredients we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in our products generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources from time to time we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate the higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption 

we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets our products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private brand and customized products some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related products are sold some of our products are sold under brands that have been licensed from others we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

many of our facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality and safety of products sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 17  17  and 18  of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

at may 26 2013  conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 34840  employees primarily in the united states approximately 40  of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 31  are parties to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire during fiscal 2014  we believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good 

research and development 

we employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition we conduct research activities related to the development of new products research and development expense was  931 million   860 million  and  814 million  in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

 we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the acquisition of ralcorp holdings inc 

the benefits that are expected to result from the acquisition which we refer to as the acquisition of ralcorp holdings inc or ralcorp will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the acquisition 

our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of ralcorp there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as ralcorp the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of ralcorp and conagra foods members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer there can be no assurance that we will successfully or costeffectively integrate ralcorp the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we are able to integrate ralcorp successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all for example we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs moreover we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of ralcorp while it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to or delays in integrating the businesses 

our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

as of may 26 2013 we had a substantial amount of debt including 3795 billion of senior notes that we issued and a 900 million term loan that we entered into in connection with the acquisition we have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur substantial additional debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 

 additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper in the event of a default the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt 

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material packaging and energy costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume reduced margins and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains wheat corn and oats oils beef pork poultry and energy changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at fair value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

the food industry is highly competitive our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases we sell branded private brand and customized food products as well as commercially branded foods and ingredients our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors in addition when branded competitors focus on price and promotion the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or 

other expenditures or losing market share our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

significant private brand competitive activity can lead to price declines 

some private brand customer buying decisions are based on a periodic bidding process in which the successful bidder is assured the selling of its selected product to the retail customer until the next bidding process our sales volume may decrease significantly if our offer is too high and we lose the ability to sell private brand products through these channels even temporarily alternatively we risk reducing our margins if our offer is successful but below our desired price points either of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us 

during fiscal 2013 our largest customer walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 17 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that walmart stores inc and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes government action or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have continued to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business these consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their store brand products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label or store brand competition our profitability could decline 

consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities the failure to achieve our goals with respect to sodium or saturated fat our research and development efforts our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management or our responses to any of the foregoing failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the us and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and 

administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could affect our net operating revenues 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as corn wheat and potatoes we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and potential disruption cyber attacks security problems and expanding social media vehicles present new risks 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results in addition there is a risk of business interruption litigation risks and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information 

the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about the company on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation in addition the disclosure of nonpublic company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

if existing antidumping measures imposed against certain foreign imports of dry pasta terminate we will face increased competition from foreign companies and the profit margins or market share of our pasta products could be adversely affected 

antidumping and countervailing duties on certain italian and turkish imports imposed by the united states department of commerce in 1996 enable our pasta business and its domestic competitors to compete more favorably against italian and turkish producers in the us pasta market in september 2007 the us international trade commission extended the antidumping and countervailing duty orders for an additional five years through 2012 and is in the process of conducting reviews to determine whether to revoke the orders   if the antidumping and countervailing duty orders are repealed or foreign producers sell competing pasta products in the united states at prices lower than ours or enter the us market by establishing production facilities in the united states the result would further increase competition in the us pasta market and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in connection with ralcorps separation of its post brand cereals business post agreed to indemnify ralcorp for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that posts ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement that ralcorp entered into with post in connection with the separation of ralcorps post brand cereals business post agreed to indemnify ralcorp for certain liabilities third parties may seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that post agreed to retain or assume and there can be no 

assurance that the indemnification from post will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that post will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in addition even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from post any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 

the separation of the post brand cereals business could result in significant tax liability 

in february 2012 ralcorp separated post into a new publicly traded company through a distribution of shares of post common stock to ralcorp shareholders ralcorp obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of post common stock in the spinoff qualified as tax free to post ralcorp and ralcorps shareholders for us federal income tax purposes if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect then we will not be able to rely on the ruling furthermore the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spinoff satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment rather the private letter ruling was based on representations by ralcorp that those requirements were satisfied and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling in connection with the spinoff ralcorp also obtained an opinion of outside counsel substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of post common stock in the separation qualified as tax free to post ralcorp and ralcorps shareholders for us federal income tax purposes the opinion relied on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by post and ralcorp which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail 

if notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel the separation were determined not to qualify as tax free each us holder of ralcorp common stock who received shares of post common stock in the separation would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of post common stock received in that case we would be subject to tax as if ralcorp had sold all the outstanding shares of post common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares at the time of the separation over ralcorps tax basis in such shares 

under the terms of the tax sharing agreement ralcorp entered into with post in connection with the separation post is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on post or ralcorp and its subsidiaries in the event that the separation and certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment as a result of actions taken or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement by post or any of its affiliates however if the separation or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates we would be responsible for all such taxes 

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could negatively impact our net worth 

the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as the inability to quickly replace lost comanufacturing business increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry ebitda multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could negatively impact our net worth 

the termination or expiration of current comanufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations 

our businesses periodically enter into comanufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of branded products the terms of these agreements vary but are generally for relatively short periods of time volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the products life cycle product promotions alternative production capacity and other factors none of which are under our direct control our future ability to enter into comanufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed and a decrease in current comanufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume 

our pending ardent mills joint venture with cargill and chs may not be completed 

the closing of our pending ardent mills joint venture with cargill incorporated and chs inc is subject to various conditions to closing including the receipt of certain financing the receipt of certain governmental approvals related to antitrust in applicable foreign jurisdictions the absence of any pending proceeding initiated by any governmental entity seeking to enjoin the closing and other customary closing conditions such as those relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties and compliance with covenants these closing conditions may not be satisfied and in that circumstance we may be unable or unwilling to complete this joint venture 

ardent mills may not achieve the benefits that are anticipated from the joint venture 

the benefits that are expected to result from the pending ardent mills joint venture will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated cost synergies in the transaction ardent mills ability to successfully integrate the conagra mills and horizon milling businesses and its ability to successfully manage the joint venture on a goingforward basis it is not certain that we will realize these benefits at all and if we do it is not certain how long it will take to achieve these benefits if for example we are unable to achieve the anticipated cost savings or if there are unforeseen integration costs or if ardent mills is unable to operate the joint venture smoothly in the future the financial performance of the joint venture may be negatively affected 

if we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected in addition we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers any of these factors could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

presentation of derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results 

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives except those related to our milling operations see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings 

the following table presents the net derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions under this methodology 



as of may 26 2013  the cumulative amount of net derivative losses from economic hedges that had been recognized in corporate and not yet allocated to reporting segments was  91 million  this amount reflected net gains of  748 million  incurred during fiscal 2013 as well as net losses of  589 million  incurred prior to fiscal 2013 based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify losses of  56 million  and  35 million  to segment operating results in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 and thereafter respectively 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

net sales 



overall our net sales increased  212 billion  to  1549 billion  in fiscal 2013  reflecting an 8  increase in our consumer foods segment and a 4  increase in our commercial foods segment relative to results in fiscal 2012 as well as increased sales due to the acquisition of ralcorp during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 

consumer foods net sales for fiscal 2013  were  907 billion  an increase of  6931 million  or 8  compared to fiscal 2012  results reflected an 8 benefit from acquisitions and a 2 increase from net pricingmix offset by a 2 decrease in volume performance from our base businesses those businesses owned for all of fiscal 2013 and 2012 increase in pricingmix was due to pricing initiatives taken toward the end of fiscal 2012 the decrease in volume performance from our base businesses is primarily attributable to volume elasticity or the dampening effect of price increases on sales volume in the marketplace for fiscal 2013 

sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands including act ii ®  hebrew national ®  hunts ®  marie callenders ®  orville redenbachers ®  pam ®  peter pan ®  reddiwip ®  rotel ®  slim jim ®   swiss miss ®  and wesson ®  grew in fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  significant brands whose products experienced sales declines in fiscal 2013  include banquet ®  blue bonnet ®   chef boyardee ®   david ®  egg beaters ®  healthy choice ®  kid cuisine ®   manwich ®  and snack pack ®

ralcorp food group and ralcorp frozen bakery products net sales for fiscal 2013 approximately four months of ownership were  9242 million  and  3299 million  respectively sales for both ralcorp food group and ralcorp frozen bakery products

operating profit earnings before general corporate expenses interest expense net income taxes and equity method investment earnings 



consumer foods operating profit for fiscal 2013  was  110 billion  an increase of  432 million  or 4  compared to fiscal 2012  gross profits in consumer foods were  2702 million  higher in fiscal 2013  than in fiscal 2012  driven by the impact of higher net sales discussed above and the benefit of supply chain cost savings initiatives partially offset by moderate inflation in product costs particularly for proteins packaging peanuts sweeteners and beans businesses acquired in fiscal 2013 contributed 410 million of operating profit to fiscal 2013 other items that significantly impacted consumer foods operating profit in fiscal 2013 included 

 items that significantly impacted consumer foods operating profit in fiscal 2012 included

in fiscal 2013  net interest expense was  2756 million  an increase of  716 million  or 35  from fiscal 2012 the increase reflects the issuance of 3975 billion of senior debt borrowings of 15 billion under a term loan facility and 7160 million of senior debt that was exchanged in january 2013 in financing the ralcorp acquisition in addition to the issuance of 7500 million of senior notes in september 2012 interest expense in fiscal 2013 and 2012 reflected a net benefit of 86 million and 89 million respectively primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable these hedges were terminated in fiscal 2011

as of the end of fiscal 2013  our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult 

on january 11 2013 we issued approximately 92 million shares of our common stock from treasury shares for net proceeds of 2693 million net proceeds were used as part of the overall financing of ralcorp

been provided thereon we have not provided us deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of nonus affiliates and associated companies that the company considers to be reinvested indefinitely however in the unusual event that additional foreign funds are needed in the united states the company has the ability to repatriate additional funds the repatriation could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes it is not practicable to estimate the amount of us income taxes that would be incurred in the event that we were to repatriate the cumulative earnings of nonus affiliates and associated companies 

 we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 to be approximately 650 million we intend to refinance the 500 million in senior debt due in april 2014

variable interest entities not consolidated

obligations and commitments 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements debt agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as takeorpay contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available of these items debt and capital lease obligations which totaled 930 billion  as of may 26 2013  were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations which totaled  152 billion  as of may 26 2013  were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

as part of our ongoing operations we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event eg guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet a summary of our commitments including commitments associated with equity method investments as of may 26 2013  was as follows

we were a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing company where we had guaranteed under certain conditions repayment of a secured loan the secured loan of this onion supplier to the onion suppliers lender the amount of our guarantee was 250 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we received notice from the lender that the onion supplier had defaulted on the secured loan and we exercised our option to purchase the secured loan from the lender for 408 million thereby assuming firstpriority secured rights to the underlying collateral for the amount of the secured loan and cancelling our guarantee the onion supplier filed for bankruptcy on april 12 2012 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 the secured loan was classified as other assets at the end of fiscal 2012 during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we acquired ownership and all rights to the collateral consisting of agricultural land and a processing facility securing the secured loan through the bankruptcy proceeding during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we recognized an impairment charge of 102 million in our commercial foods segment to reduce the carrying amount of the collateral to its estimated fair value based upon updated appraisals based on our estimate of the value of the land and processing facility we expect to recover the remaining carrying value through our operation or sale of these assets 

federal income tax credits were generated related to our sweet potato production facility in delhi louisiana third parties invested in certain of these income tax credits we have guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income tax credits over their statutory lives through fiscal 2017 in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or reduced the face value of the income tax credits was 212 million as of may 26 2013  we believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax credits is remote and therefore we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee 

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 26 2013  was 1000 million  the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 26 2013  that if recognized would impact our effective tax rate was 618 million  recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management 

our auditfinance committee has reviewed management’s development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

marketing costs —we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs which include advertising customer incentives and consumer incentives we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the judgment required in determining marketing costs can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to customers management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

we have recognized reserves of approximately  2134 million  for these marketing costs as of may 26 2013  changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows 

advertising and promotion expenses totaled  4740 million   3645 million  and  3719 million  in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in 

evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 16 “ pretax income and income taxes ” to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup management’s estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above management’s estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately  658 million  for environmental liabilities as of may 26 2013  the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy historically the underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary 

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers’ compensation in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time we had recognized a pension liability of  4808 million  and  5656 million  a postretirement liability of  3027 million  and  2826 million  and a workers’ compensation liability of  1051 million  and  763 million  as of the end of fiscal 2013  and 2012  respectively we also had recognized a pension asset of  66 million  and  39 million  as of the end of fiscal 2013   and 2012  respectively as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status 

we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation “the corridor” in current period expense annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when measurement is required otherwise under generally accepted accounting principles 

we recognized pension expense from company plans of 235 million 4218 million and 540 million in fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively such amounts reflect the yearend writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of 2164 million 1960 million and 1680 million in fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively we contributed 198 million 3264 million and 1294 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 191 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2014 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate we select a discount rate each year as of our fiscal yearend measurement date for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans the hypothetical bond portfolio is 

comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moody’s aa available at the measurement date based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 45 for fiscal 2013  53 for fiscal 2012  and 58 for fiscal 2011  we selected a discount rate of 405 for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2014  a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2013  would have resulted in a decrease of 36 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2013  a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2013  would have resulted in an increase of 262 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2013  for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected discount rates of 405 and 45 for fiscal years 2013  and 2012  respectively 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plan’s investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 775 for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2013  pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2013  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by 67 million we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2014  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2014  would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by 82 million 

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans we determine this assumption based on our longterm plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions based on this information we selected 425 for fiscal years 2013  and 2012  as the rate of compensation increase for determining our yearend pension obligation we selected 425 for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for each of fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2013  would increase pension expense for our pension plans by 09 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2013  would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by 08 million for the year we selected a rate of 425 for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2014  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2014  would increasedecrease pension expense for our pension plans by 09 million for the year 

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense of 88 million 78 million and 118 million in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively we reflected liabilities of 3027 million and 2826 million in our balance sheets as of may 26 2013  and may 27 2012  respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 260 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2014  

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 39 for fiscal 2013  43 for fiscal 2012  and 54 for fiscal 2011  we have selected a weightedaverage discount rate of 335 for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2014  a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2013 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 90 with the trend rate decreasing to 50 by 2022 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 



we provide workers’ compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the weightedaverage discount rate used at may 26 2013  was 244 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers’ compensation expense 

business combinations impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets and goodwill —we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any 

excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets as a result in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands while other acquired intangible assets eg customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of determinablelived intangibles are primarily based upon historical experience the competitive and macroeconomic environment and our operating plans the costs of determinablelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 

we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets identifiable intangible assets and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 in conjunction with managements annual review of intangible assets we adopted new guidance for testing intangibles for impairment see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

if we determine to perform a quantitative impairment test we utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital except in the case of recently acquired identifiable intangible assets as the calculated fair value of our other identifiable intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying value of these assets a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge 

in fiscal 2013 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles acquired prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2012 the results of the quantitative test did not result in any impairment of intangibles because the fair values exceeded their respective carrying values 

for indefinite lived intangible assets acquired subsequent to the second quarter of fiscal 2012 a qualitative impairment test was performed which included an assessment in light of current events and circumstances of the assumptions and inputs used in determining the initial intangible asset values the results of the qualitative test did not result in any impairment 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining 

cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

in testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for goodwill 

in fiscal 2013 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for goodwill the results of the quantitative test did not result in any impairment of goodwill because the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2013 and 2012 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies these fluctuations impacted all reporting segments 

commodity market risk 

we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions to a lesser extent we engage in wheat trading activities in the milling operations of our commercial foods segment these trading activities are limited in terms of maximum dollar exposure as measured by a dollarsatrisk methodology and monitored to ensure compliance 

interest rate risk 

from time to time we use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt during fiscal 2010 we entered into interest rate swap contracts used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable during fiscal 2011 we terminated these interest rate swap contracts as a result of this termination we received proceeds of 315 million the cumulative adjustment to the fair value of the debt instruments that were hedged 348 million was included in longterm debt and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of the debt instruments through fiscal 2014 at may 26 2013  the unamortized amount was 85 million 

during fiscal 2011 we entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the interest rate risk related to our forecasted issuance of longterm debt in 2014 based on the anticipated refinancing of the senior longterm debt maturing at that time the net notional amount of these interest rate derivatives at may 26 2013  was 5000 million the maximum potential loss associated with these interest rate swap contracts from a hypothetical decrease of 1 in interest rates is approximately 1334 million any such gain or loss to the extent the hedge was effective would be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings over the life of the forecasted interest payments associated with the anticipated debt refinancing at may 26 2013  we had recognized an unrealized loss of 1045 million in accumulated other comprehensive income for these derivative instruments 

as of may 26 2013 and may 27 2012 the fair value of our long term debt including current installments was estimated at 102 billion and 35 billion respectively based on current market rates provided primarily by outside investment advisors as of may 26 2013  and may 27 2012 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our long 

term debt by approximately 6303 million and 2108 million respectively while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our long term debt by approximately 7065 million and 2346 million respectively 

foreign currency risk 

in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 

valueatrisk var 

we employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk including valueatrisk var models we perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions we use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of var that is used to monitor our daily risk the purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices our model uses a 95 confidence level accordingly in any given one day time period losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5 of the time we include commodity swaps futures and options and foreign exchange forwards swaps and options in this calculation the following table provides an overview of our average daily var for our energy agriculture and other commodities for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 as well as the average daily foreign exchange var other commodities below consist primarily of forward and option contracts for a commodities index the market price of which is closely correlated with that of our commodity inputs this index includes items such as agricultural commodities energy commodities and metals the other commodities category below may also include items such as packaging andor livestock

general 

the following comments pertain to both of our reporting segments 

conagra foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded and valueadded consumer products as well as foodservice products and ingredients we also manufacture and sell private label products we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in our products generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate the higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption 

we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets our products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private label and customized products some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related products are sold some of our products are sold under brands that have been licensed from others we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

many of our facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality and safety of products sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 17 18 and 18 of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

at may 27 2012 conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 26100 employees primarily in the united states approximately 42 of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 43 are parties to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire during fiscal 2013 we believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good 

research and development 

we employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition we conduct research 

  

activities related to the development of new products research and development expense was 86 million 81 million and 78 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risks and uncertainties could affect our operating results and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

the food industry is highly competitive and increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with private label products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards private label offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us 

during fiscal 2012 our largest customer walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 17 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that walmart stores inc and other significant customers will continue to 

  

purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

disputes with significant suppliers including pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue these consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their private label products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label competition our profitability could decline 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

our success depends in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering and other adulteration of food products we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competitive reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

  

any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities the failure to achieve our goals with respect to sodium or saturated fat our research and development efforts our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management or our responses to any of the foregoing failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

if we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected in addition we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers any of these factors could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the us and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and injunctive relief civil remedies including 

  

fines injunctions and recalls of our products our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could affect our net operating revenues 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as corn wheat and potatoes we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

our information technology resources must provide efficient connections between our business functions or our results of operations will be negatively impacted 

each year we engage in billions of dollars of transactions with our customers and vendors because the amount of dollars involved is so significant our information technology resources must provide connections among our marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service and accounting functions if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches we began implementing new financial and operational information technology systems in fiscal 2008 and placed systems into production during fiscal 2008 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 if future implementation problems are encountered our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and potential disruption cyber attacks security problems and expanding social media vehicles present new risks 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and any significant breakdown invasion destruction or interruption of these systems could negatively impact operations in addition there is a risk of business interruption and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information 

the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about the company on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation in addition the disclosure of nonpublic company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition results of operation and the market price of our common stock

in february 2011 our board of directors approved a plan recommended by executive management designed to optimize our manufacturing and distribution networks the “network optimization plan” which we previously referred to as the “2011 plan” the network optimization plan consists of projects that involve among other things the exit of certain manufacturing facilities the disposal of underutilized manufacturing assets and actions designed to optimize our distribution network implementation of the plan is expected to continue through fiscal 2013 and is intended to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and reduce costs in connection with the network optimization plan we currently estimate we will incur aggregate pretax costs of approximately 83 million including approximately 26 million of cash charges in fiscal 2012 and 2011 we recognized charges of 42 million and 31 million respectively in relation to the network optimization plan

segment review 

we report our operations in two reporting segments consumer foods and commercial foods in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we changed the manner in which the expenses associated with certain administrative functions are recognized in segment sales accordingly segment results of prior periods have been reclassified to reflect these changes 

consumer foods 

the consumer foods reporting segment includes branded and private label food products that are sold in various retail and foodservice channels principally in north america the products include a variety of categories meals entrees condiments sides snacks and desserts across frozen refrigerated and shelfstable temperature classes

the commercial foods reporting segment principally includes commercially branded foods and ingredients which are sold primarily to foodservice food manufacturing and industrial customers the segment’s primary products include specialty potato products milled grain ingredients and a variety of vegetable products seasonings blends and flavors which are sold under brands such as conagra mills ®  lamb weston ®  and spicetec flavors  seasonings tm  

presentation of derivative gains losses for economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results 

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives except those related to our milling operations see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings 

the following table presents the net derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions under this methodology in millions 

 

 based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify losses of 47 million and 12 million to segment operating results in fiscal 2013 and 2014 and thereafter respectively amounts allocated or to be allocated to segment operating results during fiscal 2012 and thereafter include 32 million of net gains recognized within corporate expense prior to fiscal 2012

sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands including act ii ®  blue bonnet ®  chef boyardee ®  healthy choice ®  manwich ®  marie callender’s ®  peter pan ®  slim jim ®  van camp’s ®  and wesson ®  grew in fiscal 2012 significant brands that experienced sales declines in fiscal 2012 included banquet ®  crunch ‘n munch ®  egg beaters ®  hebrew national ®  hunt’s ®  kid cuisine ®  orville redenbacher’s ®  pam ®  reddiwip ®  snack pack ®  and swiss miss ®

 operating profit 

earnings before general corporate expense interest expense net income taxes and equity method investment earnings 

 in millions 

 

 consumer foods operating profit decreased 73 million in fiscal 2012 versus the prior year to 105 billion gross profits in the consumer foods segment were 11 million higher in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 driven by the benefit of price increases and supply chain cost savings initiatives offset by the impact of higher commodity input costs particularly for proteins vegetable oil and packaging businesses acquired in fiscal 2012 contributed 13 million of operating profit to fiscal 2012 other items that significantly impacted consumer foods operating profit in fiscal 2012 included 

 

  

  

  

 items that significantly impacted consumer foods operating profit in fiscal 2011 included 

 

  

 commercial foods operating profit increased 37 million in fiscal 2012 versus the prior year to 547 million gross profits in the commercial foods segment were 56 million higher in fiscal 2012 than fiscal 2011 driven by higher sales volume and improved pricing in the lamb weston ® specialty potato business largely offset by lower profits in our flour milling business the decline in margins in the flour milling business was due to less favorable market conditions in the current year sga expenses were higher in the commercial foods segment in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 largely due to a 14 million increase in incentive compensation expense the commercial foods segment also recognized charges of 6 million in fiscal 2012 related to the execution of our restructuring plans

respectively in 2011 the income was principally from interest on the notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising business in fiscal 2009 interest expense in fiscal 2012 and 2011 also reflected a net benefit of 9 million and 13 million respectively primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable these hedges were terminated in fiscal 2011 and the benefit of the repayment of 343 million of our 675 senior notes in september 2011 

income taxes 

our income tax expense was 196 million and 422 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings was 29 for fiscal 2012 and 34 in fiscal 2011 the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 was reflective of the benefit of normal recurring income tax credits and deductions combined with a lower pretax level of earnings due in large part to the impact of the writeoff of 397 million of actuarial losses under the newly adopted method of pension accounting as well as the nontaxable nature of the 59 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held noncontrolling equity interest in atfl in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in that company 

we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events to be approximately 34

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity and capital 

our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure including our goal of maintaining an investment grade credit rating that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives if necessary we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories less accounts payable accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets 

in september 2011 we entered into a 15 billion revolving credit facility the facility is scheduled to mature in september 2016 borrowings under this facility will bear interest at 11 over libor and may be prepaid without penalty the facility like its predecessor facility has historically been used principally as a backup facility for our commercial paper program as of may 27 2012 there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility the facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65 of our consolidated capital base and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 175 to 10 on a fourquarter rolling basis as of may 27 2012 we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

as of may 27 2012 we had borrowings of 40 million outstanding under our commercial paper program which was representative of the highest borrowings during the fiscal year 

as of the end of fiscal 2012 our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult 

in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009 we received 550 million face value of the notes issued by the purchaser of the divested business during fiscal 2010 we received 115 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on a portion of the notes in advance of the scheduled maturity date during fiscal 2011 we received 554 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining notes in advance of the scheduled maturity dates

we hold a 50 interest in lamb weston rdo a potato processing venture we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston rdo we receive a fee for these services based on a percentage of the net sales of the venture we reflect the value of our ownership interest in this venture in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets based upon the equity method of accounting the balance of our investment was 15 million and 14 million at may 27 2012 and may 29 2011 respectively representing our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this venture the capital structure of lamb weston rdo includes owners’ equity of 30 million and term borrowings from banks of 43 million as of may 27 2012 we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this venture 

we lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities the lease agreements with these entities include fixedprice purchase options for the assets being leased representing our only variable interest in these lessor entities these leases are accounted for as operating leases and accordingly there are no material assets or liabilities associated with these entities included in our balance sheets we have no material exposure to loss from our variable interests in these entities we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities in making this determination we have considered among other items the terms of the lease agreements the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased and the capital structure of the lessor entities 

obligations and commitments 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as “takeorpay” contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in the normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available of these items debt and capital lease obligations which totaled 30 billion as of may 27 2012 were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations which totaled approximately 881 million as of may 27 2012 were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

a summary of our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2012 was as follows 

 

   

  

the purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect 638 million of open purchase orders or 437 million of agreements for goods and services some of which are not legally binding these purchase orders and agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year 

the operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by noncancellable sublease rentals of approximately 38 million 

we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our longterm debt and capital lease obligations the weighted average interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 27 2012 was approximately 70 

we own a 4999 interest in lamb weston bsw llc “lamb weston bsw” a potato processing venture with ochoa ag unlimited foods inc “ochoa” we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston bsw under certain circumstances we could be required to compensate ochoa for lost profits resulting from significant production shortfalls “production shortfalls” commencing on june 1 2018 or on an earlier date under certain circumstances we have a contractual right to purchase the remaining equity interest in lamb weston bsw from ochoa the “call option” we are currently subject to a contractual obligation to purchase all of ochoa’s equity investment in lamb weston bsw at the option of ochoa the “put option” the purchase prices under the call option and the put option the “options” are based on the book value of ochoa’s equity interest at the date of exercise as modified by an agreedupon rate of return for the holding period of the investment balance the agreedupon rate of return varies depending on the circumstances under which any of the options are exercised as of may 27 2012 the price at which ochoa had the right to put its equity interest to us was 343 million this amount which is presented within other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet is not included in the “contractual obligations” table above as the payment is contingent upon the exercise of the put option by ochoa and the eventual occurrence and timing of such exercise is uncertain 

as part of our ongoing operations we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event eg guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet a summary of our commitments including commitments associated with equity method investments as of the end of fiscal 2012 is as follows 

 

 in certain limited situations we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity we guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations resulting from the 2002 divestiture of our fresh beef and pork operations the remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed four years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was approximately 11 million included in the table above as of may 27 2012 

we have also guaranteed the performance of the divested business with respect to a hog purchase contract the hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 12 million hogs annually through june 1 2013 the contract stipulates minimum price commitments based in part on market prices and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs we have not established a liability for these guarantees as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote 

we are a party to various potato supply agreements under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements we have guaranteed repayment of shortterm bank loans of the potato suppliers under certain conditions at may 27 2012 the amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was approximately 

  

44 million included in the table above we have not established a liability for these guarantees as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote 

we were a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing company where we had guaranteed under certain conditions repayment of a secured loan the “secured loan” of this onion supplier to the onion supplier’s lender the secured loan was in the amount of approximately 40 million classified as other assets in fiscal 2012 with a remaining term of approximately 11 years the amount of our guarantee was 25 million we had the option to purchase the secured loan and thereby assume firstpriority secured rights to the underlying collateral for the amount of the secured loan during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we received notice from the lender that the onion supplier had defaulted on the secured loan and we purchased the secured loan from the lender for approximately 41 million and cancelled our guarantee the onion supplier subsequently filed for bankruptcy on april 12 2012 based on our estimate of the value of the collateral and our firstpriority secured rights we expect to recover the carrying value of the secured loan 

federal income tax credits were generated related to the construction of our sweet potato production facility in delhi louisiana third parties invested in certain of these income tax credits we have guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income tax credits over their statutory lives through fiscal 2017 in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or reduced the face value of the income tax credits was 21 million included in the table above as of may 27 2012 we believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax credits is remote and therefore we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee 

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 27 2012 was approximately 49 million the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 27 2012 that if recognized would impact our effective tax rate was approximately 30 million recognition of this tax benefit would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management 

our auditfinance committee has reviewed management’s development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

marketing costs —we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs which include advertising customer incentives and consumer incentives we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to customers management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

we have recognized reserves of approximately 165 million for these marketing costs as of may 27 2012 changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows 

advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled 365 million 372 million and 409 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 16 “ pretax income and income taxes ” to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup management’s estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above management’s estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately 71 million for environmental liabilities as of may 27 2012 the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy historically the underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary 

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers’ compensation in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time we had recognized a pension liability of 566 million and 352 million a postretirement liability of 283 million and 322 million and a workers’ compensation liability of 76 million and 74 million as of the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively we also had recognized a pension asset of 4 million and 15 million as of the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status 

in may 2012 we elected to change our method of accounting for pension benefits historically we have recognized actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

upon each plan remeasurement amortizing them into operating results over the average future service period of active employees in these plans to the extent such gains and losses were in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation the “corridor” we have elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur to the extent they exceed the corridor therefore eliminating the amortization actuarial gains and losses outside the corridor to the extent they occur will be recognized annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when measurement is required otherwise under generally accepted accounting principles additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets we will no longer use the marketrelated value of plan assets an averaging technique permitted under generally accepted accounting principles but instead will use the fair value of plan assets these changes are intended to improve the transparency of our operating results by more quickly recognizing the effects of changes in plan asset values and the impact of current interest rates on plan obligations 

we recognized pension expense from company plans of 422 million 54 million and 227 million in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively such amounts reflect an increase in pension expense reflecting the immediate writeoff of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of our pension liability in accordance with our newly adopted change in accounting method this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of 196 million 168 million and 142 million in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we contributed 326 million 129 million and 123 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 20 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2013 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate we select a discount rate each year as of our fiscal yearend measurement date for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans the hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moody’s aa available at the measurement date based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 53 for fiscal year 2012 58 for fiscal 2011 and 69 for fiscal 2010 we selected a discount rate of 45 for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2013 a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2012 would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 97 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2012 a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2012 would have resulted in an increase of approximately 101 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2012 for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected discount rates of 45 and 53 for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 respectively 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plan’s investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 775 for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2012 pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 6 million we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2013 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2013 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 7 million 

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans we determine this assumption based on our longterm plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions based on this information we selected 425 for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 as the rate of compensation increase for determining our yearend pension obligation we selected 425 for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for each of fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year we selected a rate of 

  

425 for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2013 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2013 would increasedecrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year 

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense of 8 million 12 million and 9 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we reflected liabilities of 283 million and 322 million in our balance sheets as of may 27 2012 and may 29 2011 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 31 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2013 

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 43 for fiscal 2012 54 for fiscal 2011 and 66 for fiscal 2010 we have selected a discount rate of 39 for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2013 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 75 with the trend rate decreasing to 50 by 2016 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 we provide workers’ compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the discount rate used at may 27 2012 was 30 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers’ compensation expense 

impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets —we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets 

we utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital as the calculated fair value of our other identifiable intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge 

  

goodwill —goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 in conjunction with management’s annual review of goodwill we adopted new guidance for testing goodwill for impairment see note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” to the consolidated financial statements under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit this would be fiscal 2011 in which the estimated fair values of all reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for goodwill 

during the fiscal 2012 annual review of goodwill management performed the qualitative assessment for all reporting units and concluded that it was more likely than not that their estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values as such no further analysis was required

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2012 and 2011 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies these fluctuations impacted all reporting segments 

commodity market risk —we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions 

interest rate risk —from time to time we use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt during fiscal 2010 we entered into interest rate swap contracts used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable during fiscal 2011 we terminated these interest rate swap contracts as a result of this termination we received proceeds of 32 million the cumulative adjustment to the fair value of the debt instruments being hedged 35 million was included in longterm debt and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of the debt instruments through fiscal 2014 at may 27 2012 the unamortized amount was 18 million 

during fiscal 2011 we entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the interest rate risk related to our forecasted issuance of longterm debt in 2014 based on the anticipated refinancing of the senior longterm debt maturing at that time the net notional amount of these interest rate derivatives at may 27 2012 was 500 million the maximum potential loss associated with these interest rate swap contracts from a hypothetical change of 1 in interest rates as of may 27 2012 is approximately 151 million any such loss or gain would be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings over the life of the forecasted interest payments associated with the anticipated debt refinancing at may 27 2012 we had recognized an unrealized loss of 154 million in accumulated other comprehensive income for these derivative instruments 

as of may 27 2012 and may 29 2011 the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at 35 billion and 36 billion respectively based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors as of may 27 2012 and may 29 2011 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 211 million and 208 million respectively while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 235 million and 232 million respectively 

foreign currency risk —in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 

valueatrisk var —we employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk including valueatrisk “var” models we perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions we use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of var that is used to monitor our daily risk the purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices our model uses a 95 confidence level accordingly in any given one day time period losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5 of the time we include commodity swaps futures and options and foreign exchange forwards swaps and options in this calculation the following table provides an overview of our average daily var for our energy agriculture and other 

  

commodities as well as the average daily foreign exchange var other commodities may include items such as packaging livestock andor metals

general 

 

the following comments pertain to both of our reporting segments 

 

conagra foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded and valueadded consumer products as well as foodservice products and ingredients we also manufacture and sell private label products we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in our products generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs in the last twelve months we seek to mitigate the higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption 

 

we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets our products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private label and customized products some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

 

demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

 

our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related products are sold some of our products are sold under brands that have been licensed from others we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

 

many of our facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality and safety of products sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 18 18 and 17 of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

at may 29 2011 conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 23200 employees primarily in the united states approximately 48 of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 40 are parties to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire during fiscal 2012 we believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good 

 

research and development 

 

we employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition we conduct research activities related to the development of new products research and development expense was 81 million 78 million and 78 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the following risks and uncertainties could affect our operating results and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

 

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

 

  

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases 

 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

 

the food industry is highly competitive and increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with private label products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards private label offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

 

many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue these consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their private label products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label competition our profitability could decline 

 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preference or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering and other adulteration of food products we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competitive reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

 

we may not successfully complete proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses 

 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses our financial results could be materially and adversely affected in addition we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers any of these factors could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and injunctive relief civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could affect our net operating revenues 

 

our information technology resources must provide efficient connections between our business functions or our results of operations will be negatively impacted 

 

each year we engage in billions of dollars of transactions with our customers and vendors because the amount of dollars involved is so significant our information technology resources must provide connections among our marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service and accounting functions if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches we began implementing new financial and operational information technology systems in fiscal 2008 and placed systems into production during fiscal 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 if future implementation problems are encountered our results of operations could be negatively impacted

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

in fiscal 1991 we acquired beatrice company “beatrice” as a result of the acquisition and the significant preacquisition contingencies of the beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries our consolidated postacquisition financial statements reflect liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies these include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by beatrice prior to its acquisition by us the litigation includes suits against a number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers including conagra grocery products and the company as alleged successors to w p fuller co a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by beatrice until 1967 although decisions favorable to us have been rendered in rhode island new jersey wisconsin and ohio we remain a defendant in active suits in illinois and california the illinois suit seeks classwide relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of lead in blood in california a number of cities and counties have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the alleged public nuisance

settlement of insurance claim related to garner north carolina accident 

 

on june 9 2009 an accidental explosion occurred at our manufacturing facility in garner north carolina the “garner accident” this facility was the primary production facility for our slim jim ® branded meat snacks on june 13 2009 the us bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives announced its determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental natural gas release and not a deliberate act 

 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we reached a settlement of this matter with our insurance providers and we recognized a gain net of fiscal 2011 expenditures related to this matter of approximately 105 million 

 

the costs incurred and insurance recoveries recognized in fiscal 2011 and 2010 are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows 

 

 

 

the amounts in the table above exclude actual lost profits due to the interruption of the meat snacks business in the periods presented but do reflect the recovery of the related business interruption insurance claim in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 

 

restructuring plans 

 

in february 2011 our board of directors approved a plan recommended by executive management designed to optimize our manufacturing and distribution networks the “network optimization plan” which we previously referred to as the “2011 plan” the network optimization plan consists of projects that involve among other things the exit of certain manufacturing facilities the disposal of underutilized manufacturing assets and actions designed to optimize our distribution network implementation of the plan is expected to continue through fiscal 2013 and is intended to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and reduce costs 

 

in connection with the network optimization plan we currently estimate we will incur aggregate pretax costs of approximately 55 million including approximately 22 million of cash charges in fiscal 2011 we recognized charges of 31 million in relation to the network optimization plan 

 

in march 2010 we announced a plan authorized by our board of directors related to the longterm production of our meat snack products the plan provides for the closure of our meat snacks production facility in garner north carolina and the movement of production to our existing facility in troy ohio since the garner accident the troy facility has been producing a portion of our meat snack products upon substantial completion of the plan’s implementation by the end of fiscal 2011 the troy facility has become our primary meat snacks production facility 

in may 2010 we made a decision to consolidate certain administrative functions from edina minnesota to naperville illinois the transition of these functions was completed in the first half of fiscal 2011 this plan together with the plan to move production of our meat snacks from garner north carolina to troy ohio are collectively referred to as the 2010 restructuring plan the “2010 plan” in connection with the 2010 plan we expect to incur pretax cash and noncash charges of 68 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 we recognized charges of approximately 26 million and 39 million respectively in relation to these plans 

 

as part of a focus on cost reduction we previously carried out a restructuring plan focused on streamlining our supply chain and reducing selling general and administrative costs the “20062008 restructuring plan” as part of the 20062008 restructuring plan we began construction of a new production facility in fiscal 2007 as a result of an updated assessment of manufacturing strategies and the related impact on this partially completed production facility we decided to divest this facility accordingly in fiscal 2010 we recognized a noncash impairment charge of 33 million representing a writedown of the carrying value of the assets to fair value based on anticipated proceeds from the sale this charge is reflected in selling general and administrative expenses within the consumer foods segment 

 

the network optimization plan and the 2010 plan are collectively referred to as our restructuring plans 

 

management continues to evaluate our manufacturing footprint and potential opportunities to generate cost savings if such opportunities are identified the network optimization plan will be amended accordingly and this could lead to significant additional restructuring expenses

segment review 

 

we report our operations in two reporting segments consumer foods and commercial foods 

 

consumer foods 

 

the consumer foods reporting segment includes branded and private label food products that are sold in various retail and foodservice channels principally in north america the products include a variety of categories meals entrees condiments sides snacks and desserts across frozen refrigerated and shelfstable temperature classes 

 

in may 2011 we completed the sale of the assets of our frozen handhelds operations for approximately 10 million we recognized charges totaling 22 million 14 million aftertax relating to the impairment of the longlived assets of the business we reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

in february 2010 we completed the sale of our luck’s ® brand for proceeds of approximately 22 million in cash resulting in a pretax gain of 14 million 9 million aftertax reflected in selling general and administrative expenses 

 

in june 2009 we completed the divestiture of the fernando’s ® foodservice business for proceeds of 6 million in cash we reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of the divested fernando’s ® business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods prior to divestiture 

 

commercial foods 

 

the commercial foods reporting segment principally includes commercially branded foods and ingredients which are sold primarily to foodservice food manufacturing and industrial customers the segment’s primary products include specialty potato products milled grain ingredients and a variety of vegetable products seasonings blends and flavors which are sold under brands such as conagra mills ®  lamb weston ®  and spicetec flavors  seasonings tm  

 

as discussed above we reflected the results of the gilroy foods  flavors tm operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of the divested gilroy foods  flavors tm dehydrated vegetable business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented prior to divestiture 

 

presentation of derivative gains losses for economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results 

 

derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives except those related to our milling operations see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings 

the following table presents the net derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions under this methodology in millions 

 

 

 

based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify gains of 34 million and losses of 2 million to segment operating results in fiscal 2012 and 2013 and thereafter respectively amounts allocated or to be allocated to segment operating results during fiscal 2011 and thereafter include net losses of 3 million recognized within corporate expense prior to fiscal 2011 

 

2011 vs 2010 

 

net sales 

 in millions 

 

 

 

overall our net sales increased 288 million to 123 billion in fiscal 2011 reflecting a 1 increase in our consumer foods segment and a 6 increase in our commercial foods segment relative to results in fiscal 2010 

 

consumer foods net sales for fiscal 2011 were 80 billion an increase of 1 as compared to fiscal 2010 results reflected a 2 benefit from acquisitions net of divestitures a 1 decrease in volume from existing businesses and essentially unchanged net pricing and mix the decrease in volume from existing businesses reflected highly competitive pricing for some products as well as lower consumption in certain product categories the net pricing impacts for fiscal 2011 were not significant reflecting the fact that price increases in the second half of the year were offset by pricing reductions earlier in the year related to competitive pressures 

 

sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands including blue bonnet ®  marie callender’s ®  peter pan ®  reddiwip ®  rotel ®  slim jim ®  snack pack ®  and wesson ®  grew in fiscal 2011 significant brands that experienced sales declines in fiscal 2011 included act ii ®  banquet ®  chef boyardee ®  egg beaters ®  healthy choice ®  hunt’s ®  libby’s ®  orville redenbacher’s ®  pam ®  swiss miss ®  and van camp’s ®

selling general and administrative expenses includes general corporate expense “sga” 

 

sga expenses totaled 151 billion for fiscal 2011 a decrease of 308 million or 17 compared to fiscal 2010 

 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 reflected the following 

 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 included the following 

 

  

operating profit 

earnings before general corporate expense interest expense net income taxes and equity method investment earnings 

 in millions 

 

 

 

consumer foods operating profit increased 34 million in fiscal 2011 versus the prior year to 114 billion gross profits were 156 million lower in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010 driven by the impact of higher commodity 

input costs that were not fully offset by the benefit of price increases and supply chain cost savings initiatives other items that significantly impacted consumer foods operating profit in fiscal 2011 included 

 

  

items that significantly impacted consumer foods operating profit in fiscal 2010 included 

 

  

commercial foods operating profit decreased 34 million in fiscal 2011 versus the prior year to 505 million gross profits in our lamb weston ® specialty potato business were negatively impacted in fiscal 2011 by significant increases in input costs which more than offset the benefit of increased sales volumes and a higher quality potato crop than that which was processed in fiscal 2010 and the first half of fiscal 2011 gross profits in our flour milling business improved in fiscal 2011 due to effective management of margins in a volatile wheat market which more than offset the decrease in sales volumes sga expenses were lower in the commercial foods segment in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 largely due to a 13 million decrease in incentive compensation expense the commercial foods segment also recognized charges of 11 million in fiscal 2011 in connection with our restructuring plans 

 

interest expense net 

 

in fiscal 2011 net interest expense was 178 million an increase of 17 million or 11 from fiscal 2010 included in net interest expense was 42 million and 85 million of interest income in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively principally from the notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising business in june 2008 interest expense in fiscal 2011 also reflected a net benefit of 13 million primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable this hedge was terminated in fiscal 2011 and the benefit of the repayment of 248 million of debt in september 2010 

 

during fiscal 2010 we received 115 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on a portion of the notes in advance of the scheduled maturity date in december 2010 we received 554 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining notes in advance of the scheduled maturity dates we expect net interest expense to be significantly higher in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 reflecting lower interest income 

 

income taxes 

 

our income tax expense was 421 million and 361 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings was 34 for fiscal 2011 and 33 in fiscal 2010 the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was reflective of favorable changes in estimates and audit settlements as well as certain income tax credits and deductions identified in fiscal 2010 that related to prior periods these benefits were offset in part by unfavorable tax consequences of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 

 

we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events to be approximately 34 

equity method investment earnings 

 

we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers our share of earnings from our equity method investments was 26 million 6 million in the consumer foods segment and 20 million in the commercial foods segment and 22 million 5 million in the consumer foods segment and 17 million in the commercial foods segment in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively equity method investment earnings in the commercial foods segment reflected improving market conditions in a foreign potato processing venture and continued difficult market conditions for our domestic potato ventures 

 

results of discontinued operations 

 

our discontinued operations generated aftertax losses of 12 million and 19 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively in fiscal 2011 we completed the sale of the assets of a small frozen foods business for approximately 10 million we recognized aftertax impairment charges totaling 14 million in connection with this sale in fiscal 2010 we decided to divest our dehydrated vegetable operations as a result of this decision we recognized an aftertax impairment charge of 40 million in fiscal 2010 representing a writedown of the carrying value of the related longlived assets to fair value based on the anticipated sales proceeds the sale of this business for 246 million in cash was completed in july 2010 operating results of discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 include the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter relating to a divested business operating results of discontinued operations in fiscal 2010 include charges related to certain legal and environmental matters of divested businesses

net sales 

 in millions 

 

 

 

overall our net sales decreased 334 million to 1202 billion in fiscal 2010 primarily driven by fiscal 2009 including 53 weeks as well as lower flour milling net sales in fiscal 2010 resulting from lower underlying wheat costs passed on to customers this decrease was partially offset by improved pricing and mix in the consumer foods segment and the lamb weston ® specialty potato products business in the commercial foods segment volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2 in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of the additional week of results 

 

consumer foods net sales for fiscal 2010 were 794 billion basically flat as compared to fiscal 2009 results reflected flat volume and essentially unchanged net pricing and mix volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2 in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of the additional week of results excluding the impact of the additional week volume increased 2 in fiscal 2010 reflecting successful innovation and marketing 

 

sales of products associated with some of our other most significant brands including chef boyardee ®  healthy choice ®  hunt’s ®  marie callender’s ®  orville redenbacher’s ®  reddiwip ®  and snack pack ® grew in fiscal 2010 sales of blue bonnet ® and wesson ® declined by 19 and 7 respectively in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 largely due to the impact of passing through lower vegetable oil costs other significant brands whose 

products experienced sales declines in fiscal 2010 include act ii ®  banquet ®  egg beaters ®  kid cuisine ®  libby’s ®  pam ®  and slim jim ®  

 

commercial foods net sales were 408 billion in fiscal 2010 a decrease of 370 million or 8 compared to fiscal 2009 net sales in our flour milling business were approximately 330 million lower in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 principally reflecting the passthrough of lower wheat prices results also reflected a slight decrease in sales in our lamb weston ® specialty potato products business reflecting lower volume of approximately 2 partially offset by increased pricing volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2 in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of the additional week of results excluding the impact of the additional week volume was essentially unchanged in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009

 in millions 

 

 

 

consumer foods operating profit increased 164 million in fiscal 2010 versus the prior year to 11 billion gross profits were 262 million higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 driven by the impact of lower commodity input costs and the benefit of supply chain cost savings initiatives consumer foods sga expenses were higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 reflecting a 34 million increase in incentive compensation expenses and a 22 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses the consumer foods segment recognized a 14 million gain on the sale of the luck’s ® brand in fiscal 2010 charges totaling 36 million were recognized in the consumer foods segment in fiscal 2010 in connection with the 2010 plan including charges related to our decision to move manufacturing activities in garner north carolina to troy ohio and our decision to move administrative functions in edina minnesota to naperville illinois an additional charge of 33 million was recognized in connection with the impairment of a production facility as we made a decision to divest the partially completed facility the consumer foods segment recognized a 19 million gain on the sale of the pemmican ® brand incurred costs of product recalls classified as sga expense of 11 million and incurred costs of 8 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2009 the impact of foreign currencies including related economic hedges resulted in a reduction of operating profit of approximately 9 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

 

the garner accident in june 2009 resulted in charges within sga totaling 47 million for the impairment of property plant and equipment workers’ compensation site cleanup and other related costs in fiscal 2010 in addition to inventory writedowns and other related costs of 12 million recognized in cost of goods sold the impact of these charges was offset by insurance recoveries of 58 million in fiscal 2010 for the involuntary conversion of assets gross profits from slim jim ® branded products were 25 million and 51 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively reflecting the impact of the disruption of production due to the accident 

 

commercial foods operating profit decreased 3 million in fiscal 2010 versus the prior year to 539 million improved gross profits in the flour milling business were partially offset by reduced gross profits in the specialty blends and flavorings business and the specialty potato business gross profits continued to be negatively impacted by challenging conditions in the foodservice channel as well as high production costs associated with a high cost and poor quality potato crop in our specialty potato business commercial foods sga expenses were higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 reflecting a 5 million increase in incentive compensation expenses commercial foods operating profit for fiscal 2009 reflected the benefit of the additional week of operations 

 

interest expense net 

 

in fiscal 2010 net interest expense was 160 million a decrease of 26 million or 14 from fiscal 2009 the reduction in net interest expense is primarily the result of increased capitalized interest and increased interest income in fiscal 2010 interest income includes 83 million and 73 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively from the paymentinkind notes received in june 2008 in connection with the divestiture of our trading and merchandising operations 

 

income taxes 

 

our income tax expense was 361 million and 317 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings was 33 for fiscal 2010 and 34 in fiscal 2009 the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was reflective of favorable changes in estimates and audit settlements as well as certain income tax 

credits and deductions identified in fiscal 2010 that related to prior periods these benefits were offset in part by unfavorable tax consequences of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 

 

equity method investment earnings 

 

we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers our share of earnings from our equity method investments was 22 million 5 million in the consumer foods segment and 17 million in the commercial foods segment and 24 million 5 million in the consumer foods segment and 19 million in the commercial foods segment in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively equity method investment earnings in the commercial foods segment reflected continued difficult market conditions for our foreign and domestic potato ventures 

 

results of discontinued operations 

 

our discontinued operations generated an aftertax loss of 19 million in fiscal 2010 and earnings of 364 million in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2010 we decided to divest our dehydrated vegetable operations as a result of this decision we recognized an aftertax impairment charge of 40 million in fiscal 2010 representing a writedown of the carrying value of the related longlived assets to fair value based on the anticipated sales proceeds in fiscal 2009 we completed the sale of the trading and merchandising operations and recognized an aftertax gain on the disposition of approximately 301 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we decided to sell certain small foodservice brands the sale of these brands was completed in june 2009 we recognized aftertax impairment charges of 6 million in fiscal 2009 in anticipation of this divestiture 

 

earnings per share 

 

our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 were 162 including earnings of 166 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of 004 per diluted share from discontinued operations our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 were 215 including earnings of 135 per diluted share from continuing operations and 080 per diluted share from discontinued operations respectively see “items impacting comparability” above as several other significant items affected the comparability of yearoveryear results of operations 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

sources of liquidity and capital 

 

our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives if necessary we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories less accounts payable accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets 

 

at may 29 2011 we had a 15 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions which matures in december 2011 we expect to refinance the facility prior to maturity at terms that will enable us to maintain sufficient liquidity to support our business needs the facility has historically been used principally as a backup facility for our commercial paper program as of may 29 2011 there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility we did not draw upon this facility or the commercial paper program during fiscal 2011 borrowings under the facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty the facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65 of our consolidated capital base and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 175 to 10 as of may 29 2011 we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

 

as of the end of fiscal 2011 our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to 

borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult 

 

in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009 we received 550 million face value of the notes issued by the purchaser of the divested business during fiscal 2010 we received 115 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on a portion of the notes in advance of the scheduled maturity date during fiscal 2011 we received 554 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining notes in advance of the scheduled maturity dates 

 

we repurchase our shares of common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board of directors in february 2010 our board of directors approved a 500 million share repurchase program with no expiration date we repurchased approximately 4 million shares of our common stock for approximately 100 million under this program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 in december 2010 our board of directors increased the company’s share repurchase authorization by 554 million the amount of the early repayment of the remaining notes we repurchased approximately 36 million shares of our common stock for 825 million under this program in fiscal 2011 the company’s total remaining share repurchase authorization was 129 million as of the end of fiscal 2011 

 

in july 2010 we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of gilroy foods  flavors tm dehydrated garlic onion capsicum and controlled moisture tm  gardenfrost ®  redimade tm  and fresh vegetable operations for 246 million in cash

in fiscal 2011 we generated 19 million of cash which was the net result of 135 billion generated from operating activities 89 million generated from investing activities 143 billion used in financing activities and an increase of 10 million in cash and cash equivalents due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled 134 billion for fiscal 2011 as compared to 143 billion generated in fiscal 2010 results reflect increased income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 improvement in our accounts payable balance largely offset increases in the inventory balance reflecting the impact of higher commodity costs in our flour milling business the yearoveryear decrease in operating cash flows also reflects higher incentive payments made in fiscal 2011 earned in fiscal 2010 than those made in fiscal 2010 related to fiscal 2009 performance we also contributed 129 million and 123 million to our companysponsored pension plans in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively cash payments of income taxes were 172 million and 291 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively reflecting the benefit of changes in certain federal income tax laws that will allow us to defer the payment of a significant amount of income taxes recognized in fiscal 2011 until future years fiscal 2011 operating cash flows also reflect the receipt of 142 million of interest due on the remaining notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009 and insurance advances of 65 million for reimbursement of outofpocket expenses and foregone profits associated with the garner accident cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was 12 million and 43 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively primarily reflecting income from operations of the discontinued gilroy foods  flavors tm dehydrated vegetable business and reduced inventory balances within that business 

 

cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled 166 million in fiscal 2011 and 352 million in fiscal 2010 investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2011 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 466 million and acquisitions of businesses and intangibles including american pie ®  totaling 149 million partially offset by the receipt of 413 million as payment in full of all amounts due on the remaining notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009 receipt of interest due 

is reflected in operating cash flows and sales of property plant and equipment of 19 million investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2010 included capital expenditures of 482 million and acquisitions of businesses and intangibles including elan totaling 107 million partially offset by sales of businesses and brands including the luck’s ® brand of 22 million and sales of property plant and equipment of 88 million also included in investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2010 was a cash inflow of 92 million of the total receipt of 115 million representing the payment in full of all principal and interest due on the first tranche of the notes in advance of the scheduled maturity date the remaining 23 million is reflected as cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations and insurance advances of 35 million for the replacement of property plant and equipment destroyed in the garner accident we generated 255 million of cash from investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 from the disposition of the gilroy foods  flavors tm dehydrated vegetable business 

 

cash used in financing activities totaled 143 billion in fiscal 2011 as compared to cash used in financing activities of 405 million in fiscal 2010 during fiscal 2011 we repurchased approximately 36 million shares of our common stock for 825 million we paid dividends of 375 million and we decreased our debt by 294 million including the repayment of the entire principal balance of 248 million of our 7875 senior notes on september 15 2010 due on that date as well as the repayment of 35 million of bank borrowings by our lamb weston bsw potato processing venture during fiscal 2011 we also received net proceeds of 60 million from employees exercising stock options net of tax payments we made related to issuance of stock awards during fiscal 2010 we paid dividends of 347 million we repurchased 100 million of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program and we reduced our longterm debt by 16 million during fiscal 2010 we also received net proceeds of 55 million from employees exercising stock options net of tax payments related to issuance of stock awards 

 

we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 will be approximately 475 million management believes that existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs planned capital expenditures and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we use offbalance sheet arrangements eg leases accounted for as operating leases where sound business principles warrant their use we also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business these are described further in “ obligations and commitments ” below 

 

variable interest entities not consolidated 

 

we have variable interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities but for which we are not the primary beneficiary we do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities 

 

we hold a 50 interest in lamb weston rdo a potato processing venture we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston rdo we receive a fee for these services based on a percentage of the net sales of the venture we reflect the value of our ownership interest in this venture in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets based upon the equity method of accounting the balance of our investment was 14 million at both may 29 2011 and may 30 2010 representing our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this venture the capital structure of lamb weston rdo includes owners’ equity of 27 million and term borrowings from banks of 50 million as of may 29 2011 we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this venture 

 

we lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities the lease agreements with these entities include fixedprice purchase options for the assets being leased representing our only variable interest in these lessor entities these leases are accounted for as operating leases and accordingly there are no material assets or liabilities associated with these entities included in our balance sheets we have no material exposure to loss from our variable interests in these entities we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities in making 

this determination we have considered among other items the terms of the lease agreements the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased and the capital structure of the lessor entities 

 

obligations and commitments 

 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as “takeorpay” contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in the normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available of these items debt and capital lease obligations which totaled 33 billion as of may 29 2011 were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations which totaled approximately 946 million as of may 29 2011 were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

 

a summary of our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2011 was as follows including obligations of discontinued operations 

 

 

 

the purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect open purchase orders of approximately 475 million some of which are not legally binding these purchase orders are expected to be settled in the ordinary course of business in less than one year 

 

we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our longterm debt and capital lease obligations the weighted average interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 29 2011 was approximately 64 

 

as part of our ongoing operations we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event eg guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet a summary of our commitments including commitments associated with equity method investments as of the end of fiscal 2011 is as follows 

 

 

 

in certain limited situations we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity we guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations resulting from the 2002 divestiture of our fresh beef and pork operations the remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed five years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was approximately 13 million included in the table above as of may 29 2011 

 

we have also guaranteed the performance of the divested business with respect to a hog purchase contract the hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 

12 million hogs annually through 2014 the contract stipulates minimum price commitments based in part on market prices and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs 

 

we are a party to various potato supply agreements under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements we have guaranteed repayment of shortterm bank loans of the potato suppliers under certain conditions at may 29 2011 the amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was approximately 34 million included in the table above we have not established a liability for these guarantees as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote 

 

we are a party to various agreements with an onion processing company we have guaranteed under certain conditions repayment of a portion of the loan held by this supplier for its onion processing related operations at may 29 2011 the amount of our guarantee was 25 million included in the table above in the event of default on this loan by the supplier we have the contractual right to purchase the loan from the lender thereby giving us secured rights to the underlying collateral we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee as we believe the likelihood of financial exposure to us under this guarantee is remote 

 

federal income tax credits were generated related to the construction of our sweet potato production facility in delhi louisiana third parties invested in certain of these income tax credits we have guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income tax credits over their statutory lives a period of seven years in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or reduced the face value of the income tax credits was 21 million as of may 29 2011 we believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax credits is remote and therefore we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee 

 

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 29 2011 was approximately 56 million the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 29 2011 that if recognized would impact our effective tax rate was approximately 36 million recognition of this tax benefit would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management 

 

our audit committee has reviewed management’s development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

 

marketing costs —we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs which include advertising customer incentives and consumer incentives we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to customers management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

 

we have recognized reserves of approximately 128 million for these marketing costs as of may 29 2011 changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows 

advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled 372 million 409 million and 381 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup management’s estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above management’s estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately 70 million for environmental liabilities as of may 29 2011 the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy historically the underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary in fiscal 2010 based on changes in the regulatory environment applicable to a particular site we reduced the recognized environmental liability by approximately 15 million 

 

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers’ compensation in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including but not limited to discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time we had recognized a pension liability of 352 million and 470 million a postretirement liability of 322 million and 321 million and a workers’ compensation liability of 74 million and 73 million as of the end of fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively we also had recognized a pension asset of 15 million as of the end of fiscal 2011 as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status 

we recognized pension expense from company plans of 55 million 47 million and 38 million in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively which reflected expected returns on plan assets of 173 million 161 million and 159 million respectively we contributed 129 million 123 million and 112 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 80 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2012 

 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate we select a discount rate each year as of our fiscal yearend measurement date for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans the hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moody’s aa available at the measurement date based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 58 for fiscal year 2011 69 for fiscal 2010 and 66 for fiscal 2009 we selected a discount rate of 53 for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2012 a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by 8 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by 9 million for the year a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately 9 million for fiscal 2012 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 10 million for fiscal 2012 for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected a discount rate of 53 and 58 for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 respectively 

 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plan’s investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 775 for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2011 pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 5 million we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2012 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 6 million 

 

when calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans we use a marketrelated value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses differences between actual return and expected return over five years the marketrelated value of assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2011 was 63 million higher than the actual fair value of plan assets 

 

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans we determine this assumption based on our longterm plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions based on this information we selected 425 for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 as the rate of compensation increase for determining our yearend pension obligation we selected 425 for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year we selected a rate of 425 for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2012 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would increasedecrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year 

 

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense of 12 million 9 million and 15 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we reflected liabilities of 322 million and 321 million in our balance sheets as of may 29 2011 and may 30 2010 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 32 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2012 

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 54 for fiscal 2011 66 for fiscal 2010 and 64 for fiscal 2009 we have selected a discount rate of 49 for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2012 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 75 with the trend rate decreasing to 50 by 2016 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect 

 

 

 

we provide workers’ compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the discount rate used at may 29 2011 was 34 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers’ compensation expense 

 

impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets —we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular assets being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 

 

we utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends 

 

in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital as the calculated fair value of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge 

 

other matters 

 

from time to time one of our business units has engaged an environmental and agricultural engineering services firm the firm is a subsidiary of an entity whose chief executive officer serves on our board of directors payments to this firm for environmental and agricultural engineering services and structures acquired totaled 03 million in both fiscal 2011 and 2010

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2011 and 2010 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies these fluctuations impacted all reporting segments as well as our trading and merchandising activities which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our financial statements 

 

commodity market risk —we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions in addition during our ownership of the trading and merchandising business divested during quarter one of fiscal 2009 we purchased and sold certain commodities such as wheat corn soybeans soybean meal soybean oil oats natural gas and crude oil presented in discontinued operations 

 

interest rate risk —from time to time we use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we entered into interest rate swap contracts used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 we terminated these interest rate swap contracts as a result of this termination we received proceeds of 32 million the cumulative adjustment to the fair value of the debt instruments being hedged 35 million was included in longterm debt and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of the debt instruments through fiscal 2014 

 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the interest rate risk related to our forecasted issuance of longterm debt in 2014 based on the anticipated refinancing of the senior longterm debt maturing at that time the net notional amount of these interest rate derivatives at may 29 2011 was 250 million the maximum potential loss associated with these interest rate swap contracts from a hypothetical change of 1 in interest rates is approximately 53 million any such gain or loss would be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings over the life of the forecasted interest payments associated with the anticipated debt refinancing at may 29 2011 we had recognized an unrealized loss of 12 million in accumulated other comprehensive income for these derivative instruments 

as of may 29 2011 and may 30 2010 the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at 36 billion and 41 billion respectively based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors as of may 29 2011 and may 30 2010 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 208 million and 234 million respectively while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 232 million and 256 million respectively 

 

foreign currency risk —in order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 

 

valueatrisk var —we employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk including valueatrisk “var” models we perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions we use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of var that is used to monitor our daily risk the purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices our model uses a 95 percent confidence level accordingly in any given one day time period losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5 percent of the time we include commodity swaps futures and options and foreign exchange forwards swaps and options in this calculation the following table provides an overview of our average daily var for our energy agriculture and other commodities as well as the average daily foreign exchange var other commodities may include items such as packaging livestock andor metals 

 

 

 

prior to fiscal 2011 we presented analyses of market risk using a sensitivity analysis methodology during fiscal 2011 we began using a var methodology for purposes of this presentation as this is a methodology used by management in monitoring market risk and we believe this is a more useful presentation to readers

general 

 

the following comments pertain to both of our reporting segments 

 

conagra foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded and valueadded consumer products we also manufacture and sell private label products we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in our products generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate the higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption 

 

we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets our products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private label and customized products some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

 

we employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition we conduct research activities related to the development of new products research and development expense was 78 million 78 million and 67 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

  our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related products are sold some of our products are sold under brands that have been licensed from others we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

 

many of our facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality and safety of products sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 18 17 and 15 of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

at may 30 2010 conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 24400 employees primarily in the united states approximately 53 of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 25 are parties to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire during fiscal 2011 we believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the following risks and uncertainties could affect our operating results and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

 

the continued volatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

 

  

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases 

 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

 

the food industry is highly competitive and increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts or a consumer shift towards private label offerings could result in us reducing pricing increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

  the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

 

many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue these consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their private label products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label competition our profitability could decline 

 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness obesity product attributes and ingredients introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preference or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering and other adulteration of food products we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competitive reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and injunctive relief civil remedies including fines 

  injunctions and recalls of our products our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could affect our net operating revenues 

 

our information technology resources must provide efficient connections between our business functions or our results of operations will be negatively impacted 

 

each year we engage in billions of dollars of transactions with our customers and vendors because the amount of dollars involved is so significant our information technology resources must provide connections among our marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service and accounting functions if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches we began implementing new financial and operational information technology systems in fiscal 2008 and placed systems into production during fiscal 2008 2009 and 2010 additional changes and enhancements will be placed into production at various times in fiscal 2011 if future implementation problems are encountered our results of operations could be negatively impacted

in fiscal 1991 we acquired beatrice company “beatrice” as a result of the acquisition and the significant preacquisition contingencies of the beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries our consolidated postacquisition financial statements reflect liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies these include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by beatrice prior to its acquisition by us the litigation includes suits against a number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers including conagra grocery products and the company as alleged successors to w p fuller co a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by beatrice until 1967 although decisions favorable to us have been rendered in rhode island new jersey wisconsin and ohio we remain a defendant in active suits in illinois and california the illinois suit seeks classwide relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of lead in blood in california a number of cities and counties have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the alleged public nuisance 

 

the environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative proceedings involving beatrice’s status as a potentially responsible party at 36 superfund proposed superfund or stateequivalent sites these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of beatrice that used or produced petroleum pesticides fertilizers dyes inks solvents pcbs acids lead sulfur tannery wastes andor other contaminants beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 33 of these sites reserves for these matters have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup the known volumetric contribution of beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites the reserves for beatrice environmental matters totaled 70 million as of may 30 2010 a majority of which relates to the superfund and stateequivalent sites referenced above the reserve for beatrice environmental matters reflects a reduction in pretax expense of approximately 15 million made in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 due to favorable regulatory developments at one of the sites we expect expenditures for beatrice environmental matters to continue for up to 20 years 

 

we are a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of the operation of our business including lawsuits and claims related to the february 2007 recall of our peanut butter products and litigation we initiated against an insurance carrier to recover our settlement expenditures and defense costs we recognized a charge of 25 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 in connection with the disputed coverage with this insurance carrier during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 a delaware state court rendered a decision on certain matters in our claim for the disputed coverage favorable to the insurance carrier we intend to appeal this decision and continue to pursue this matter vigorously 

 

an investigation by the division of enforcement of the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” of certain commodity futures transactions of a former company subsidiary has led to an investigation of us by the cftc the investigation may result in litigation by the cftc against us the former subsidiary was sold on june 23 2008 as part of the divestiture of our trading and merchandising operations the cftc’s division of 

  enforcement has advised us that it questions whether certain trading activities of the former subsidiary violated the commodity exchange act and that the cftc has been evaluating whether we should be implicated in the matter based on the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship between the two entities at the time of the trades based on information we have learned to date we believe that both we and the former subsidiary have meritorious defenses there have been discussions with the cftc concerning resolution of this matter we also believe the sale contract with the purchaser of the business provides us indemnification rights accordingly we do not believe any decision by the cftc to pursue this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations if litigation ensues we intend to defend this matter vigorously 

 

after taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing matters management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

recent developments in our strategies and action plans include 

 

garner north carolina accident 

 

on june 9 2009 an accidental explosion occurred at our manufacturing facility in garner north carolina the “garner accident” this facility was the primary production facility for our slim jim ® branded meat snacks on june 13 2009 the us bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives announced its determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental natural gas release and not a deliberate act 

 

we maintain comprehensive property including business interruption workers’ compensation and general liability insurance policies with very significant loss limits that we believe will provide substantial and broad coverage for the anticipated losses arising from this accident 

 

the costs incurred and insurance recoveries recognized to date are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows 

 

 

 

the amounts in the table above exclude lost profits due to the interruption of the business as well as any related business interruption insurance recoveries 

 

through may 30 2010 we had received payment advances from the insurers of approximately 85 million for our initial insurance claims for this matter 58 million of which has been recognized as a reduction to selling general and administrative expenses we anticipate final settlement of the claim will occur in fiscal 2011 based on management’s current assessment of production options the expected level of insurance proceeds and the estimated potential amount of losses and impact on the slim jim ® brand we do not believe that the accident will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity we expect slim jim ® profitability to reach preaccident levels by fiscal 2012 

 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we determined that certain additional equipment located in the facility with a carrying value of approximately 12 million was impaired impairment included in the table above we expect to be reimbursed by our insurers for the cost of replacing these assets and we have recognized a 12 million insurance recovery in fiscal 2010 included in the table above representing the carrying value of these destroyed assets 

 

restructuring plans 

 

in march 2010 we announced a plan authorized by our board of directors related to the longterm production of our meat snack products the plan provides for the closure of our meat snacks production facility in garner north carolina and the movement of production to our existing facility in troy ohio since the garner accident the troy facility has been producing a portion of our meat snack products upon completion of the plan’s implementation which is expected to be in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 the troy facility will be our primary meat snacks production facility this plan is expected to result in the termination of approximately 500 employee positions in garner and the creation of approximately 200 employee positions in troy 

  in may 2010 we made a decision to move certain administrative functions from edina minnesota to naperville illinois we expect to complete the transition of these functions in the first half of fiscal 2011 this plan together with the plan to move production of our meat snacks from garner north carolina to troy ohio are collectively referred to as the 2010 restructuring plan “2010 plan” in connection with the 2010 plan we expect to incur pretax cash and noncash charges for asset impairments accelerated depreciation severance relocation and site closure costs of 67 million in fiscal 2010 we recognized charges of approximately 39 million in relation to these plans 

 

as part of a focus on cost reduction we previously initiated restructuring plans focused on streamlining our supply chain reducing selling general and administrative costs “20062008 restructuring plan” and streamlining the consumer foods international operations “20082009 restructuring plan” as part of the 20062008 restructuring plan we began construction of a new production facility in fiscal 2007 as a result of an updated assessment of manufacturing strategies and the related impact on this partially completed production facility we decided to divest this facility accordingly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we recognized a noncash impairment charge of 33 million representing a writedown of the carrying value of the assets to fair value based on anticipated proceeds from the sale this charge is reflected in selling general and administrative expenses within the consumer foods segment 

 

acquisitions 

 

in june 2010 subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2010 we acquired the assets of american pie llc a manufacturer of frozen fruit pies thaw and serve pies fruit cobblers and pie crusts under the licensed marie callender’s ® and claim jumper ® trade names as well as frozen dinners pot pies and appetizers under the claim jumper ® trade name this business is included in the consumer foods segment 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we completed the acquisition of elan nutrition “elan” a privately held formulator and manufacturer of private label snack and nutrition bars for approximately 103 million in cash we expect the acquisition to add approximately 100 million to our consumer foods segment net sales in fiscal 2011 and we expect this acquisition to be accretive to operating cash flows immediately 

 

divestiture of gilroy dehydrated vegetable business 

 

in july 2010 subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2010 we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of gilroy foods  flavors tm dehydrated garlic onion capsicum and controlled moisture tm  gardenfrost ®  redimade tm  and fresh vegetable operations for 250 million in cash subject to final working capital adjustments based on our estimate of proceeds from the sale of this business we recognized impairment and related charges totaling 59 million 40 million aftertax in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

sweet potato investment 

 

in august 2009 we announced plans to build a new environmentally friendly potato processing facility near delhi louisiana designed primarily to process sweet potatoes from the region into french fries and related products as anticipated the new facility is scheduled to open in the fall of 2010 

 

segment review 

 

we report our operations in two reporting segments consumer foods and commercial foods 

 

consumer foods 

 

the consumer foods reporting segment includes branded and private label food products that are sold in various retail and foodservice channels principally in north america the products include a variety of categories meals entrees condiments sides snacks and desserts across frozen refrigerated and shelfstable temperature classes 

  during fiscal 2010 we completed the transition of the direct management of the consumer foods reporting segment from the chief executive officer to the consumer foods president position in conjunction with this organizational change beginning in fiscal 2010 we have aligned our segment reporting to be consistent with the manner in which our operating results are presented to and reviewed by our chief executive officer all prior periods have been recast to reflect this change 

 

in february 2010 we completed the sale of our luck’s ® brand for proceeds of approximately 22 million in cash resulting in a pretax gain of 14 million 9 million aftertax reflected in selling general and administrative expenses 

 

in june 2009 we completed the divestiture of the fernando’s ® foodservice business for proceeds of 6 million in cash we reflect the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of the divested fernando’s ® business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods prior to divestiture 

 

commercial foods 

 

the commercial foods reporting segment includes commercially branded foods and ingredients which are sold principally to foodservice food manufacturing and industrial customers the segment’s primary products include specialty potato products milled grain ingredients and a variety of vegetable products seasonings blends and flavors which are sold under brands such as conagra mills ®  lamb weston ®  and spicetec ®  

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we transferred the management of the alexia ® frozen food operations from the consumer foods segment to the commercial foods segment segment results have been recast to reflect this change 

 

as discussed above we reflected the results of the gilroy foods  flavors tm operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of the divested gilroy foods  flavors tm dehydrated vegetable business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented 

 

presentation of derivative gains losses for economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results 

 

in fiscal 2009 following the sale of our trading and merchandising operations and related organizational changes we transferred the management of commodity hedging activities except for those related to our milling operations to a centralized procurement group beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we began to reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives except for those related to our milling operations used to economically hedge anticipated commodity consumption in earnings immediately within general corporate expenses the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating results in the period in which the underlying item being economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold we believe this change results in better segment management focus on key operational initiatives and improved transparency to derivative gains and losses 

 

foreign currency derivatives used to manage foreign currency risk of forecasted cash flows are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions as such these derivatives are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings 

  the following table presents the net derivative gains losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions under this methodology in millions 

 

 

 

based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify losses of 5 million and gains of 2 million to segment operating results in fiscal 2011 and 2012 and thereafter respectively amounts allocated or to be allocated to segment operating results during fiscal 2010 and 2011 include 5 million of losses incurred during fiscal 2009 

 

during fiscal 2008 derivative instruments used to create economic hedges of such commodity inputs were markedtomarket each period with both realized and unrealized changes in market value immediately included in cost of goods sold within segment operating profit in fiscal 2008 net derivative gains from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions were 63 million in the consumer foods segment and 23 million in the commercial foods segment 

 

2010 vs 2009 

 

net sales 

 in millions 

 

 

 

overall our net sales decreased 347 million to 1208 billion in fiscal 2010 primarily driven by fiscal 2009 including 53 weeks as well as lower flour milling net sales in fiscal 2010 resulting from lower underlying wheat costs passed on to customers this decrease was partially offset by improved pricing and mix in the consumer foods segment and the lamb weston ® specialty potato products business in the commercial foods segment volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2 in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of the additional week of results 

 

consumer foods net sales for fiscal 2010 were 80 billion basically flat as compared to fiscal 2009 results reflected flat volume and essentially unchanged net pricing and mix volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2 in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of the additional week of results excluding the impact of the additional week volume increased 2 in fiscal 2010 reflecting successful innovation and marketing

  commercial foods net sales were 408 billion in fiscal 2010 a decrease of 370 million or 8 compared to fiscal 2009 net sales in our flour milling business were approximately 330 million lower in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 principally reflecting the passthrough of lower wheat prices results also reflected a slight decrease in sales in our lamb weston ® specialty potato products business reflecting lower volume of approximately 2 partially offset by improved pricing and mix volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2 in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of the additional week of results excluding the impact of the additional week volume was essentially unchanged in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009

consumer foods operating profit increased 164 million in fiscal 2010 versus the prior year to 11 billion gross profits were 262 million higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 driven by the impact of lower commodity input costs and the benefit of supply chain cost savings initiatives consumer foods sga expenses were higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 reflecting a 35 million increase in incentive compensation expenses and a 22 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses the consumer foods segment recognized a 14 million gain on the sale of the luck’s ® brand in fiscal 2010 charges totaling 36 million were recognized in the consumer foods segment in fiscal 2010 in connection with our 2010 plan including charges related to our decision to move manufacturing activities in garner north carolina to troy ohio and our decision to move administrative functions in edina minnesota to naperville illinois an additional charge of 33 million was recognized in connection with the impairment of a production facility as we made a decision to divest the partially completed facility the consumer foods segment recognized a 19 million gain on the sale of the pemmican ® brand incurred costs of product recalls classified as sga expense of 11 million and incurred costs of 8 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2009 the impact of foreign currencies including related economic hedges resulted in a reduction of operating profit of approximately 9 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

 

the garner accident in june 2009 resulted in charges within sga totaling 47 million for the impairment of property plant and equipment workers’ compensation site cleanup and other related costs in fiscal 2010 in addition to inventory writedowns and other related costs of 12 million recognized in cost of goods sold the impact of these charges was offset by insurance recoveries of 58 million in fiscal 2010 for the involuntary conversion of assets gross profits from slim jim ® branded products were 25 million and 51 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively reflecting the impact of the disruption of production due to the accident 

 

commercial foods operating profit decreased 4 million in fiscal 2010 versus the prior year to 539 million improved gross profits in the flour milling business were partially offset by reduced gross profits in the specialty blend and flavorings business and the specialty potato business gross profits continued to be negatively impacted by challenging conditions in the foodservice channel as well as high production costs associated with a high cost and poor quality potato crop in our specialty potato business commercial foods sga expenses were higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 reflecting a 5 million increase in incentive compensation expenses commercial foods operating profit for fiscal 2009 reflected the benefit of the additional week of operations 

 

interest expense net

  credits and deductions identified in fiscal 2010 that related to prior periods these benefits were offset in part by unfavorable tax consequences of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 

 

the company expects its effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events to be approximately 34 

 

equity method investment earnings

interest expense net 

 

in fiscal 2009 net interest expense was 186 million a decrease of 67 million or 26 from fiscal 2008 the reduction in net interest expense reflects interest income of 78 million in fiscal 2009 largely due to the paymentinkind notes received in june 2008 in connection with the divestiture of our trading and merchandising operations

  21 million in the commercial foods segment and 50 million 1 million in the consumer foods segment and 49 million in the commercial foods segment in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in equity method investment earnings in commercial foods was driven by the reduced profits of a foreign potato venture resulting primarily from excess supply of potato products in the foreign potato venture’s market 

 

results of discontinued operations 

 

our discontinued operations generated aftertax earnings of 361 million in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2009 we completed the sale of the trading and merchandising operations and recognized an aftertax gain on the disposition of approximately 301 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we decided to divest certain small foodservice brands the sale of these brands was completed in june 2009 subsequent to our fiscal 2009 we recognized aftertax impairment charges of 6 million in fiscal 2009 in anticipation of this divestiture

liquidity and capital resources 

 

sources of liquidity and capital 

 

our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives if necessary we use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories less accounts payable accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets 

 

commercial paper borrowings usually less than 30 days maturity are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets within notes payable at may 30 2010 we had a 15 billion multiyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions which matures in december 2011 the multiyear facility has historically been used principally as a backup facility for our commercial paper program as of may 30 2010 there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility borrowings under the multiyear facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty the multiyear facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65 of our consolidated capital base and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 175 to 10 as of the end of fiscal 2010 the company was in compliance with these financial covenants 

 

as of the end of fiscal 2010 our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult 

 

we have repurchased shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions as well as repurchase limits authorized by our board of directors in february 2010 our board of directors approved a 500 million share repurchase program with no expiration date we repurchased approximately 4 million shares of our common stock for approximately 100 million under this program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we completed an accelerated share repurchase program during fiscal 2009 we paid 900 million and received 384 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 when the program was initiated and an additional 56 million shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 under this program 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we issued 1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes 500 million maturing in 2014 and 500 million maturing in 2019 with an average blended interest rate of 

  approximately 64 we subsequently repaid approximately 900 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with maturities of 2010 2011 and 2027 we incurred charges of 50 million for the premium paid and transaction costs associated with the debt retirement 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we sold our trading and merchandising operations for proceeds of 1 approximately 22 billion in cash net of transaction costs 2 550 million original principal amount of paymentinkind debt securities issued by the purchaser that were recorded at an initial estimated fair value of 479 million the “notes” 3 a shortterm receivable of 37 million due from the purchaser which was subsequently collected in december 2008 and 4 a fouryear warrant to acquire approximately 5 of the issued common equity of the parent company of the divested operations which has been recorded at an estimated fair value of 18 million in may 2010 we received 115 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the first tranche of notes from the purchaser in advance of the scheduled june 19 2010 maturity date the remaining notes had a carrying value of 490 million at may 30 2010 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we completed the sale of approximately 17600 acres of farmland to an unrelated buyer and immediately entered into a longterm lease of the land with an affiliate of the buyer we received proceeds of approximately 75 million in cash removed the land from our balance sheet and recorded a deferred gain of approximately 30 million reflected primarily in noncurrent liabilities the lease agreement has an initial term of ten years and two fiveyear renewal options this lease will be accounted for as an operating lease we will recognize the deferred gain as a reduction of rent expense over the lease term 

 

in july 2010 subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2010 we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of gilroy foods  flavors tm dehydrated garlic onion capsicum and controlled moisture tm  gardenfrost ®  redimade tm  and fresh vegetable operations for 250 million in cash subject to final working capital adjustments 

 

cash flows 

 

in fiscal 2010 we generated 710 million of cash which was the net result of 147 billion generated from operating activities 355 million used in investing activities and 405 million used in financing activities 

 

cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled 144 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to 987 million generated in fiscal 2009 reflecting increased income from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 and successful execution of our working capital management initiatives improvement in our accounts payable and inventory balances reflect the impact of our working capital initiatives as well as lower commodity costs in our flour milling business the yearoveryear improvement in operating cash flows also reflects lower incentive payments made in fiscal 2010 earned in fiscal 2009 than those made in fiscal 2009 we also contributed 123 million to our companysponsored pension plans in fiscal 2010 also included in cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations are insurance advances of 50 million for reimbursement of outofpocket expenses and foregone profits associated with the garner north carolina accident cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was 30 million in fiscal 2010 primarily reflecting income from operations of the discontinued gilroy foods  flavors tm dehydrated vegetable business and reduced inventory balances within that business cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was 863 million in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the increase in commodity inventory balances and derivative assets in the trading and merchandising business during the brief period we held that business prior to its divestiture in june 2008 

 

cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled 353 million in fiscal 2010 and 461 million in fiscal 2009 investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2010 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 483 million and acquisitions of businesses and intangibles including elan totaling 107 million partially offset by sales of businesses and brands including the luck’s ® brand of 22 million and sales of property plant and equipment of 88 million also included in investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2010 was a cash inflow of 92 million of the total receipt of 115 million representing the payment in full of all principal and interest due on the first tranche of notes from gavilon llc in advance of the scheduled maturity date the remaining 23 million is reflected as cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations and insurance advances of 35 million for the replacement of property plant and equipment destroyed in the garner accident investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2009 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 430 million and expenditures of 80 million for acquisition of businesses and intangible assets we generated 

  225 billion of cash from investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2009 from the disposition of the trading and merchandising business 

 

cash used in financing activities totaled 405 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to cash used in financing activities of 183 billion in fiscal 2009 during fiscal 2010 we paid dividends of 347 million and repurchased approximately 4 million shares of our common stock for 100 million during fiscal 2010 we also received net proceeds of 55 million from employees exercising stock options and tax payments related to issuance of stock awards during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 900 million of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program we reduced our shortterm borrowings by 578 million and paid dividends of 348 million we refinanced certain of our longterm debt in fiscal 2009 issuing 1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes 500 million maturing in 2014 and 500 million maturing in 2019 we repaid 950 million aggregate principal amount of senior and subordinated notes throughout the year net losses of 49 million on the retirement of debt are also reflected as financing cash outflows 

 

we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 will be approximately 525 million which will be partly offset by anticipated insurance proceeds related to the garner accident management believes that existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs planned capital expenditures and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we use offbalance sheet arrangements eg operating leases where the sound business principles warrant their use we periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business these are described further in “ obligations and commitments ” below 

 

in september 2008 we formed a potato processing venture lamb weston bsw with ochoa ag unlimited foods inc we provide all sales and marketing services to the venture we have determined that lamb weston bsw is a variable interest entity and that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity accordingly we consolidate the financial statements of lamb weston bsw we also consolidate the assets and liabilities of several entities from which we lease corporate aircraft each of these entities has been determined to be a variable interest entity and we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary of each of these entities 

 

due to the consolidation of the variable interest entities we reflected in our balance sheets in millions 

 

 

 

the liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating lamb weston bsw do not represent additional claims on our general assets the creditors of lamb weston bsw have claims only on the assets of the specific variable 

  interest entity to which they have advanced credit the assets recognized as a result of consolidating lamb weston bsw are the property of the venture and are not available to us for any other purpose 

 

obligations and commitments 

 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as “takeorpay” contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available of these items debt and capital lease obligations which totaled 36 billion as of may 30 2010 were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations which totaled approximately 692 million as of may 30 2010 were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

 

a summary of our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2010 was as follows including obligations of discontinued operations 

 

 

 

we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our longterm debt and capital lease obligations the weighted average interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 30 2010 was approximately 69 

 

we consolidate the assets and liabilities of certain entities that have been determined to be variable interest entities and for which we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary of these entities the amounts reflected in contractual obligations from longterm debt in the table above include 83 million of liabilities of these variable interest entities to the creditors of such entities the longterm debt recognized as a result of consolidating lamb weston bsw entity does not represent additional claims on our general assets the creditors of lamb weston bsw have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entity 

 

the purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect approximately 458 million of open purchase orders some of which are not legally binding these purchase orders will be settled in the ordinary course of business in less than one year 

 

as part of our ongoing operations we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event eg guarantee debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet a summary of our commitments including commitments associated with equity method investments as of the end of fiscal 2010 is as follows 

 

 

  in certain limited situations we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity we guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations resulting from the 2002 divestiture of our fresh beef and pork operations the remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed six years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was approximately 16 million as of may 30 2010 we have also guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork business with respect to a hog purchase contract the hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 12 million hogs annually through 2014 the contract stipulates minimum price commitments based in part on market prices and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs 

 

we are a party to various potato supply agreements under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements we have guaranteed repayment of shortterm bank loans of the potato suppliers under certain conditions at may 30 2010 the amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was approximately 29 million we have not established a liability for these guarantees as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote 

 

we are a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing company we have guaranteed repayment of a portion of a loan of this supplier under certain conditions at may 30 2010 the term of the loan is 14 years the amount of our guaranty was 25 million as of may 30 2010 in the event of default on this loan by the supplier we have the contractual right to purchase the loan from the lender thereby giving us the rights to underlying collateral we have not established a liability in connection with this guaranty as we believe the likelihood of financial exposure to us under this agreement is remote 

 

federal income tax credits were generated related to our sweet potato production facility currently under construction in delhi louisiana third parties invested in certain of these income tax credits we have guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income tax credits over their statutory lives a period of seven years in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or reduced the face value of the income tax credits was 21 million as of may 30 2010 we believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax credits is remote and therefore we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee 

 

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 30 2010 was 53 million 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management 

 

our audit committee has reviewed management’s development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

 

marketing costs —we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs which include advertising customer incentives and consumer incentives we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to customers management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

  during fiscal 2010 we entered into over 120000 individual marketing programs with customers and consumers resulting in costs in excess of 25 billion these costs are reflected as a reduction of net sales changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any of the individual customer marketing programs would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows 

 

advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled 409 million 381 million and 377 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup management’s estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above management’s estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately 71 million for environmental liabilities as of may 30 2010 the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy historically the underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary in fiscal 2010 based on changes in the regulatory environment applicable to a particular site we reduced the recognized environmental liability by approximately 15 million 

 

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers’ compensation in order to measure the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time we had recognized a pension liability of 

  470 million and 317 million a postretirement liability of 321 million and 281 million and a workers’ compensation liability of 73 million and 76 million as of the end of fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

we recognized pension expense from company plans of 47 million 38 million and 56 million in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively which reflected expected returns on plan assets of 161 million 159 million and 149 million respectively we contributed 123 million 112 million and 8 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 116 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2011 

 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate we select a discount rate each year as of our fiscal yearend measurement date for fiscal 2009 and thereafter for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans the hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moody’s aa available at the measurement date based on this information the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 69 for fiscal year 2010 66 for fiscal 2009 and 575 for fiscal 2008 we selected a discount rate of 58 for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2011 a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by 16 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by 17 million for the year a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately 83 million for fiscal 2011 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 89 million for fiscal 2011 for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected a discount rate of 58 and 69 for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plan’s investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 775 for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2010 pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 5 million we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2011 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 5 million 

 

when calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans we use a marketrelated value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses differences between actual return and expected return over five years the marketrelated value of assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2010 was 232 million higher than the actual fair value of plan assets 

 

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans we determine this assumption based on our longterm plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions based on this information we selected 425 for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 as the rate of compensation increase for determining our yearend pension obligation we selected 425 for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year we selected a rate of 425 for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2011 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would increasedecrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year 

 

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense of 9 million 15 million and 23 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we reflected liabilities of 

  321 million and 281 million in our balance sheets as of may 30 2010 and may 31 2009 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 36 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2011 

 

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 66 for fiscal year 2010 64 for fiscal 2009 and 55 for fiscal 2008 we have selected a discount rate of 54 for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2011 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 80 with the trend rate decreasing to 50 by 2016 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect 

 

 

 

we provide workers’ compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the discount rate used at may 30 2010 was 375 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers’ compensation expense 

 

impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets —we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular assets being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 

 

we utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends 

 

in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital as the calculated fair value of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge 

 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board issued guidance that requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a 

  variable interest entity this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity the provisions of this guidance are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal 2011 earlier application is prohibited we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance 

 

relatedparty transactions 

 

from time to time one of our business units has engaged an environmental and agricultural engineering services firm the firm is a subsidiary of an entity whose chief executive officer serves on our board of directors payments to this firm for environmental and agricultural engineering services and structures acquired totaled 03 million and 04 million in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2010 and 2009 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies these fluctuations impacted all reporting segments as well as our trading and merchandising activities which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our financial statements 

 

commodities —we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions in addition during our ownership of the trading and merchandising business divested during quarter one of fiscal 2009 we purchased and sold certain commodities such as wheat corn soybeans soybean meal soybean oil oats natural gas and crude oil presented in discontinued operations 

 

the following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes in practice as markets move we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate 

 

fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on our net derivative position by commodity at each quarterend during the fiscal year 

  the market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying commodity positions that are being hedged the values of commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative commodity instrument 

 

effect of 10 change in market prices 

 

 

 

interest rates —we may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we entered into interest rate swap contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior longterm debt the maximum potential loss from a hypothetical change of 1 in interest rates was approximately 24 million at the end of fiscal 2009 we did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding 

 

as of may 30 2010 and may 31 2009 the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at 41 billion and 37 billion respectively based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors as of may 30 2010 and may 31 2009 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 234 million and 196 million respectively while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 256 million and 307 million respectively 

 

foreign operations —in order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our processing operations this activity primarily relates to hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 

 

the following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis for our processing operations sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in exchange rates actual changes in exchange rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

 

fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates and was based on our net foreign currency position at each quarterend during the fiscal year 

 

the market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying foreign denominated transactions that are being hedged the currencies hedged have a high inverse correlation to exchange rate changes of the foreign currency derivative instrument

general 

 

the following comments pertain to both of our reporting segments 

 

conagra foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded private label and valueadded consumer products we use many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in our products generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate the higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption 

 

we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets our products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private label and customized products some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have we have major competitors in each of our reporting segments we compete primarily on the basis of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

we employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition we conduct research activities related to the development of new products research and development expense was 81 million 69 million and 68 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

 

we manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes from time to time are not significant 

 

our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related products are sold some of our products are sold under brands that have been licensed from others we also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole we have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

 

many of our facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality and safety of products sanitation safety and health matters and environmental control we believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position 

 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 16 15 and 16 of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively this reflects all consumer foods businesses including those which are classified as discontinued operations 

 

at may 31 2009 conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 25600 employees primarily in the united states approximately 53 of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements approximately 37 are parties to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire during fiscal 2010 we believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the following factors could affect our operating results and should be considered in evaluating us 

 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

 

the continued volatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

 

  

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

 

we use many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases 

 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

 

the food industry is highly competitive and increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

 

the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

 

many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue these consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for our products for their private label products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label competition our profitability could decline 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preference then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful 

 

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry our profitability could decrease 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry particularly in an environment of volatile input costs we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability 

 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering and other adulteration of food products we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death in addition we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage in the past we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competitive reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

 

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products and health and safety of our employees our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and injunctive relief civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity 

 

our information technology resources must provide efficient connections between our business functions or our results of operations will be negatively impacted 

 

each year we engage in billions of dollars of transactions with our customers and vendors because the amount of dollars involved is so significant our information technology resources must provide connections among our marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service and accounting functions if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches we are currently implementing new financial and operational information technology systems some systems were placed into production during fiscal 2008 and 

2009 additional changes and enhancements will be placed into production at various times in fiscal 2010 if future implementation problems are encountered our results of operations could be negatively impacted

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

in fiscal 1991 we acquired beatrice company “beatrice” as a result of the acquisition and the significant preacquisition contingencies of the beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries our consolidated postacquisition financial statements reflect liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies these include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by beatrice prior to its acquisition by the company the litigation includes several public nuisance and personal injury suits against a number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers including conagra grocery products and the company as alleged successors to w p fuller co a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by beatrice until 1967 although decisions favorable to us have been rendered in rhode island new jersey wisconsin and ohio we 

remain a defendant in active suits in illinois and california the illinois suit seeks classwide relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of lead in blood in california a number of cities and counties have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the alleged public nuisance 

 

the environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative proceedings involving beatrice’s status as a potentially responsible party at 35 superfund proposed superfund or stateequivalent sites these sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of beatrice that used or produced petroleum pesticides fertilizers dyes inks solvents pcbs acids lead sulfur tannery wastes andor other contaminants beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 33 of these sites reserves for these matters have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup the known volumetric contribution of beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites the reserves for beatrice environmental matters totaled 888 million as of may 31 2009 a majority of which relates to the superfund and stateequivalent sites referenced above expenditures for beatrice environmental matters are expected to continue for a period of up to 20 years 

 

we are a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of the operation of our business including lawsuits and claims related to the february 2007 recall of our peanut butter products and litigation we initiated against an insurance carrier to recover our settlement expenditures and defense costs we recognized a charge of 253 million during the second half of fiscal 2009 in connection with the disputed coverage with this insurance carrier 

 

an investigation by the division of enforcement of the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” of certain commodity futures transactions of a former company subsidiary has led to an investigation by the cftc of the company itself the investigation may result in litigation by the cftc against the company the former subsidiary was sold on june 23 2008 as part of the divestiture of our trading and merchandising operations the cftc’s division of enforcement has advised the company that it questions whether certain trading activities of the former subsidiary violated the commodity exchange act the “cea” and that the cftc has been evaluating whether we should be implicated in the matter based on the existence of the parentsubsidiary relationship between the two entities at the time of the trades based on information we have learned to date the company believes that both it and the former subsidiary have meritorious defenses we have submitted a statement to the division of enforcement contesting any purported liability we also believe the sale contract with the buyer of the business provides us indemnification rights accordingly we do not believe any decision by the cftc to pursue this matter will have a material adverse effect on the company if litigation ensues the company intends to defend itself vigorously 

 

after taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing matters management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 16 

  

we also made strategic investments in fiscal 2008 and 2009 in order to enhance our portfolio in fiscal 2009 we entered into a potato processing venture lamb weston bsw with an initial investment of 46 million we consolidate this venture in fiscal 2008 we acquired alexia foods lincoln snacks watts brothers and twin city foods for a total of approximately 255 million in cash plus assumed liabilities 

 

dispositions of businesses

capital allocation 

 

in fiscal 2009 we took advantage of a favorable interest rate environment and refinanced a portion of our debt specifically we issued 1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes 500 million maturing in 2014 and 500 million maturing in 2019 with an average blended interest rate of approximately 64 with the proceeds from this debt issuance we repaid approximately 900 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and in the process paid approximately 50 million 31 million aftertax of premiums and related transaction fees in addition we contributed 100 million to our companysponsored defined benefit pension plans

in addition during fiscal 2009 we executed the following 

 

  

opportunities and challenges 

 

we believe our operating initiatives will favorably impact future sales profits and returns on capital because of the scope of change underway there is risk that these broad change initiatives will not be successfully implemented input costs competitive pressures the ability to execute operational changes and implement pricing actions among other factors will affect the timing and impact of these initiatives 

 

we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate the higher input costs through pricing and productivity initiatives and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption we are also focusing on selling general and administrative cost initiatives as evidenced by the implementation of our restructuring plans as 

well as our zero overhead growth initiative if the benefits from pricing actions supply chain productivity improvements economic hedges and selling general and administrative cost reduction initiatives are insufficient to cover these expected higher input costs results of operations particularly consumer foods operating profit may continue to be negatively impacted 

 

changing consumer preferences may impact sales of certain of our products we offer a variety of food products that appeal to a range of consumer preferences and utilize innovation and marketing programs to develop products that fit with changing consumer trends as part of these programs we introduce new products and product extensions 

 

consolidation of many of our customers continues to result in increased buying power negotiating strength and complex service requirements for those customers this trend which is expected to continue may negatively impact gross margins particularly in the consumer foods segment in order to effectively respond to this customer consolidation we continually evaluate our consumer marketing sales and customer service strategies we are implementing trade promotion programs designed to improve return on investment and pursuing shelf placement and customer service improvement initiatives 

 

the continuing volatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways consumers may shift purchases to lowerpriced private label or other value offerings or may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns which may adversely affect our results of operations the financial stability of our customers and suppliers may be compromised which could result in additional bad debts for us or nonperformance by suppliers volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and required pension contributions decreased demand in the restaurant business particularly casual and fine dining may adversely affect our commercial foods operations 

 

other 

 

on june 9 2009 an accidental explosion occurred at our manufacturing facility in garner north carolina this facility was the primary production facility for our slim jim ® branded meat snacks the packaging area of the plant is expected to be out of service for the foreseeable future on june 13 2009 the us bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives announced its determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental natural gas release and not a deliberate act 

 

we maintain comprehensive property including business interruption workers’ compensation and general liability insurance policies with very significant loss limits that we believe will provide substantial and broad coverage for the currently foreseeable losses arising from this accident we anticipate that we will incur modest costs related to deductibles and copayment obligations under available insurance policies as well as other onetime costs that are not currently expected to be material 

 

segment review 

 

we report our operations in two reporting segments consumer foods and commercial foods 

 

in june 2009 subsequent to our fiscal 2009 year end we completed the divestiture of the fernando’s ® foodservice brand for proceeds of approximately 64 million we reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of the divested fernando’s ® business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented 

 

presentation of commodity and foreign currency derivative gains and losses in segment results 

 

prior to fiscal 2008 we designated certain commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges qualifying for hedge accounting treatment we discontinued designating derivatives as cash flow hedges during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2008 subsequent to the cessation of designating derivatives for hedge accounting 

treatment derivative gains and losses were recorded immediately in our segment results as a component of cost of goods sold regardless of when the item being hedged impacted earnings 

 

following the sale of our trading and merchandising operations and related organizational changes in fiscal 2009 we transferred the management of commodity hedging activities except for those related to our milling operations to a centralized procurement group beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we began to reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives except for those related to our milling operations used to hedge anticipated commodity consumption in earnings immediately within general corporate expenses the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating results in the period in which the underlying item being hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold we believe this change results in better segment management focus on key operational initiatives and improved transparency to derivative gains and losses 

 

in fiscal 2008 we began to centrally manage foreign currency risk for all of our reporting segments foreign currency derivatives used to manage foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment as such these derivatives are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings we believe that these derivatives provide economic hedges of the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions 

 

the following table presents the net derivative losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and foreign currency risk for fiscal 2009 under this new methodology in millions 

 

 

 

based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items we expect to reclassify losses of 78 million and gains of 25 million to segment operating results in fiscal 2010 and 2011 respectively 

 

in fiscal 2008 net derivative gains from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and currency risk of our foreign operations were 626 million in the consumer foods segment and 264 million in the commercial foods segment in fiscal 2007 net derivative gains from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and currency risk of our foreign operations were 140 million in the consumer foods segment and 76 million in the commercial foods segment

snacks and store brands net sales were 140 billion an increase of 1 compared to fiscal 2007 results reflected decreased sales of approximately 1 from lower volume and mix offset by improved net pricing of approximately 2 sales of the orville redenbacher’s ® brand increased offset by sales declines in act ii ®  pemmican ®  and slim jim ®  net sales from the lincoln snacks business acquired during fiscal 2008 resulted in a 30 million increase as compared to fiscal 2007 the peanut butter and pot pie recalls which included store brands negatively impacted this subsegment’s net sales by 23 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

 

enabler brands 

 

enabler brands net sales were 143 billion an increase of 10 compared to fiscal 2007 results reflect increases of approximately 7 due to net pricing and approximately 3 due to volume and mix sales of wesson ®  blue bonnet ®  libby’s ®  wolf ®  and the max ® brands increased these increases were offset by net sales declines in angela mia ® and parkay ®  a refrigerated pizza business sold during fiscal 2007 generated sales of 17 million in fiscal 2007 

 

domestic export 

 

domestic export net sales were 193 million an increase of 15 compared to fiscal 2007 these results reflected a 15 increase principally due to volume and mix the net pricing impact was flat 

 

commercial foods net sales were 413 billion in fiscal 2008 an increase of 706 million or 21 increased sales are reflective of higher sales prices in our milling operations due to higher grain prices and price and volume increases in our specialty potato and dehydrated vegetable operations the fiscal 2007 divestiture of an oat milling operation resulted in a reduction of sales of 27 million for fiscal 2008 partially offset by increased sales of 18 million from the acquisition of watts brothers in february 2008 

 

profit contribution margin pcm 

net sales less cost of goods sold and advertising and promotion expense 

 in millions 

 

 

 

consumer foods pcm for fiscal 2008 was 163 billion a decrease of 62 million or 4 from the prior year the decrease in pcm reflected significantly higher input costs partially offset by improved net pricing mix and volume the increased input costs were partially offset by productivity improvements and gains on derivatives held 

to economically hedge current and future input costs the factors impacting comparability of consumer foods net sales also impact the comparability of consumer foods pcm due to the peanut butter recall that was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the subsequent reintroduction of peter pan ® peanut butter products in august 2007 pcm in the consumer foods segment is not comparable across periods consumer foods pcm from all peanut butter products including both branded and private label in fiscal 2008 was 23 million lower than comparable amounts in fiscal 2007 consumer foods pcm on banquet ® and private label pot pies products were lower by approximately 22 million in fiscal 2008 relative to fiscal 2007 primarily due to product returns and lost sales newly acquired businesses contributed 13 million to pcm in fiscal 2008 costs of implementing our restructuring plans reduced consumer foods pcm for fiscal 2008 and 2007 by 4 million and 45 million respectively highlights by subsegment are as follows 

 

grocery foods north america 

 

grocery foods north america pcm was 685 million a decrease of 11 increased sales were offset by higher input costs across the portfolio of brands that decreased pcm by approximately 19 advertising and promotion costs were in line with prior year levels the change in pcm includes a benefit of approximately 11 million due to favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes peter pan ® pcm was lower by 21 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the peanut butter recall that was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 peter pan ® peanut butter products were reintroduced in august 2007 affecting the yearoveryear results of the operations 

 

frozen foods 

 

frozen foods pcm was 326 million a decrease of 1 the impact of increased sales and lower advertising and promotion expense was more than offset by higher input costs across the portfolio of brands banquet ® pcm was lower by 17 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the pot pie recall 

 

snacks and store brands 

 

snacks and store brands pcm was 294 million a decrease of 14 increases due to the impact of higher sales and lower advertising and promotion expense were more than offset by higher input costs across the portfolio of brands the peanut butter and pot pie recalls which included store brands negatively impacted this subsegment’s pcm by 7 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

 

enabler brands 

 

enabler brands pcm was 228 million a decrease of 19 increases in net sales were more than offset by the impact of higher input costs across the portfolio of brands primarily due to the increase in cost of edible oils advertising and promotion expense was in line with prior year levels 

 

domestic export 

 

domestic export pcm was 35 million an increase of 30 the impact of increased sales was offset by the impact of input costs fiscal 2008 pcm was also favorably impacted by a decrease in advertising and promotion expense 

 

other consumer foods pcm for fiscal 2008 principally includes net gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs partially offset by restructuring and other expenses not allocated directly to subsegments for fiscal 2007 other consumer foods pcm principally includes restructuring costs and other expenses not allocated directly to subsegments partially offset by net gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs these amounts are not reflected in subsequent pcm results 

 

commercial foods pcm was 709 million for fiscal 2008 an increase of 131 million or 23 over the prior year improved results reflected increased pcm of 68 million in our milling operations due to a favorable wheat commodity environment and improved flour conversion margins we also achieved an increase in pcm of 61 million in our specialty potato business as benefits from pricing volume growth and product mix management exceeded the impact of higher input costs results also reflected gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs as well as profits from wheat derivatives trading 

selling general and administrative expenses includes general corporate expense “sga” 

 

sga expenses totaled 176 billion for fiscal 2008 virtually unchanged from the prior fiscal year 

 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008 reflected the following 

 

  

included in sga expenses for fiscal 2007 were the following items 

 

  

operating profit 

earnings before general corporate expense interest expense net income taxes and equity method investment earnings 

 in millions 

 

 

 

consumer foods operating profit decreased 81 million in fiscal 2008 versus the prior fiscal year to 830 million the decrease for the fiscal year was reflective of the decreased pcm discussed above and was influenced by a number of factors including 

 

 28 

 

commercial foods operating profit increased 77 million to 512 million in fiscal 2008 operating profit improvement was principally driven by the improved pcm as discussed above other factors affecting the increased operating profit included higher selling expense and compensation costs in fiscal 2008 and gains recorded in fiscal 2007 of 18 million related to our sale of an oat milling business and 8 million resulting from a legal settlement related to a fire 

 

interest expense net 

 

in fiscal 2008 net interest expense was 253 million an increase of 34 million or 15 over the prior fiscal year increased interest expense reflected our use of commercial paper to finance higher working capital balances in all segments particularly in the trading and merchandising business which is now presented within discontinued operations we also earned less interest income due to lower balances of cash on hand in fiscal 2008 

 

equity method investment earnings 

 

we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers our share of earnings from our equity method investments was 50 million 1 million in the consumer foods segment and 49 million in the commercial foods segment and 28 million 2 million in the consumer foods segment and 26 million in the commercial foods segment in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in equity method investment earnings in commercial foods was driven by improved performance of a foreign potato venture 

 

results of discontinued operations 

 

income from discontinued operations was 412 million net of tax in fiscal 2008 included in these amounts are 

 

  

income from discontinued operations was 283 million net of tax in fiscal 2007 included in these amounts are 

 

  

income taxes and net income 

 

the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings was 30 for fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2008 we adjusted our estimates of income taxes payable due to increased benefits from a domestic manufacturing deduction and lower foreign income taxes resulting in a lower than normal effective tax rate these impacts and tax benefits related to a change in the legal structure of our subsidiaries are the primary contributors to the decrease in the yeartodate effective tax rate from fiscal 2007 

the effective tax rate was 34 in fiscal 2007 in 2007 state income taxes included approximately 24 million of benefits related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in estimates principally related to state tax jurisdictions these benefits were offset by the tax impact of an internal revenue service audit settlement 

 

net income was 931 million or 190 per diluted share in fiscal 2008 compared to 765 million or 151 per diluted share in fiscal 2007 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

sources of liquidity and capital 

 

our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives we currently use shortterm debt principally to finance ongoing operations including our seasonal requirements for working capital accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories less accounts payable accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets 

 

commercial paper borrowings usually less than 30 days maturity are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets within notes payable at may 31 2009 we had a 15 billion multiyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions which matures in december 2011 the multiyear facility has historically been used solely as a backup facility for our commercial paper program as of may 31 2009 there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility borrowings under the multiyear facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty the multiyear facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65 of our consolidated capital base and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 175 to 10 as of the end of fiscal 2009 the company was in compliance with these financial covenants 

 

as of the end of fiscal 2009 our senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we issued 1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes 500 million maturing in 2014 and 500 million maturing in 2019 with an average blended interest rate of approximately 64 we subsequently repaid approximately 900 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with maturities of 2010 2011 and 2027 we incurred charges of 50 million for the premium paid and transaction costs associated with the debt retirement we also contributed 100 million to our pension plans in order to improve the funded status of the plans 

 

we have repurchased our shares of common stock from time to time based on repurchase limits authorized by our board of directors and market conditions during fiscal 2008 we repurchased 188 million of our shares during fiscal 2009 we executed an accelerated share repurchase buying back approximately 44 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 900 million at may 31 2009 our current share repurchase authorization was essentially exhausted 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we sold our trading and merchandising operations for proceeds of 1 approximately 22 billion in cash net of transaction costs 2 550 million face value of paymentinkind debt securities issued by the purchaser the “notes” which was recorded at an initial estimated fair value of 479 million 3 a shortterm receivable of 37 million due from the purchaser which was subsequently collected and 4 a fouryear warrant to acquire approximately 5 of the issued common equity of the parent company of the divested operations which has been recorded at an estimated fair value of 18 million the notes which are classified as other assets had a carrying value of 522 million at may 31 2009 

cash flows 

 

in fiscal 2009 we generated 72 million of cash which was the net result of 124 million generated from operating activities 179 billion generated from investing activities and 183 billion used in financing activities 

 

cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled 978 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to 371 million generated in fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2008 cash flows from income of continuing operations were largely absorbed by increased working capital requirements particularly due to increased quantities and unit costs of inventory in fiscal 2009 improved income from continuing operations and working capital management efforts resulted in significantly improved cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations specifically we improved the speed of our collection of accounts receivable and converted derivative positions used in our economic hedging activities to cash which more than offset the increase in cropbased inventory balances in our commercial foods businesses the increased inventory balances in our commercial foods businesses are largely due to the purchase of strong potato and garlic crops coupled with lower demand in the foodservice channel we also contributed 112 million to our companysponsored pension plans in fiscal 2009 cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was 854 million in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the increase in commodity inventory balances and derivative assets in the trading and merchandising business during the brief period we held that business prior to its divestiture in june 2008 cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was 278 million in fiscal 2008 

 

cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled 467 million in fiscal 2009 and 676 million in fiscal 2008 investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2009 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 442 million and acquisitions of businesses including lamb weston bsw and intangible assets totaling 84 million partially offset by sales of businesses including the pemmican ® business and fixed assets investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of expenditures of 255 million related to the acquisition of businesses see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and capital expenditures of 489 million which included approximately 39 million of expenditures related to the purchase of certain warehouse facilities from our lessors these warehouses were sold for proceeds of approximately 36 million to unrelated third parties immediately thereafter offset by 30 million of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment we generated 226 billion of cash from investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2009 from the disposition of the trading and merchandising business we generated 32 million from investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2008 primarily from the sale of the knott’s berry farm ® jams and jellies brand and operations 

 

cash used in financing activities totaled 183 billion in fiscal 2009 as compared to cash used in financing activities of 22 million in fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 900 million of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program we reduced our shortterm borrowings by 578 million and paid dividends of 348 million we refinanced certain of our longterm debt in fiscal 2009 issuing 1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes 500 million maturing in 2014 and 500 million maturing in 2019 we repaid 950 million aggregate principal amount of senior and subordinated notes throughout the year net losses of 49 million on the retirement of debt are also reflected as financing cash outflows during fiscal 2008 we repurchased 188 million of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program and paid dividends of 362 million as part of the watts brothers acquisition we repaid 64 million of assumed longterm debt subsequent to the acquisition in addition to these early retirements of debt we made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2008 reducing longterm debt by 21 million also during fiscal 2008 we increased our shortterm borrowings by 577 million primarily reflecting the financing of significantly increased working capital 

 

we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 will be approximately 475 million management believes that existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs planned capital expenditures and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we use offbalance sheet arrangements eg operating leases where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use we periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business these are described further in “obligations and commitments” below 

 

in september 2008 we formed a potato processing venture lamb weston bsw with ochoa ag unlimited foods inc we provide all sales and marketing services to the venture we have determined that lamb weston bsw is a variable interest entity and that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity accordingly we consolidate the financial statements of lamb weston bsw we also consolidate the assets and liabilities of several entities from which we lease corporate aircraft each of these entities has been determined to be a variable interest entity and we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary of each of these entities 

 

due to the consolidation of the variable interest entities we reflected in our balance sheets 

 

 

 

the liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these entities do not represent additional claims on the general assets of the company the creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities to which they have advanced credit 

 

obligations and commitments 

 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as “takeorpay” contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available of these items debt and capital lease obligations which totaled 36 billion as of may 31 2009 were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations which totaled approximately 10 billion as of may 31 2009 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

a summary of our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2009 was as follows including obligations of discontinued operations 

 

 

 

we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our longterm debt and capital lease obligations the weighted average interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 31 2009 was approximately 70 

 

we consolidate the assets and liabilities of certain entities that have been determined to be variable interest entities and for which we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary of these entities the amounts reflected in contractual obligations of longterm debt in the table above include 89 million of liabilities of these variable interest entities to the creditors of such entities the longterm debt recognized as a result of consolidating these entities does not represent additional claims on our general assets the creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities as of may 31 2009 we were obligated to make rental payments of 60 million to the variable interest entities of which 7 million is due in less than one year 23 million is due in one to three years and 30 million is due in three to five years such amounts are not reflected in the table above 

 

the purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect approximately 474 million of open purchase orders some of which are not legally binding these purchase orders will be settled in the ordinary course of business in less than one year 

 

as part of our ongoing operations we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event eg guarantee debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet a summary of our commitments including commitments associated with equity method investments as of the end of fiscal 2009 was as follows 

 

 

 

in certain limited situations we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity we have outstanding guarantees of certain railcar leases of the divested trading and merchandising business now operating as the gavilon group llc “gavilon” the railcar leases were in place prior to the divestiture and the parties are working with the lessors to secure our release the remaining terms of these lease agreements do not exceed two years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was 3 million as of may 31 2009 we have not established a liability for these guarantees which are included in the table above as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote 

 

we guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations resulting from our fresh beef and pork divestiture the remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed seven years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was approximately 18 million as of may 31 2009 we have also 

guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork business with respect to a hog purchase contract the hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 12 million hogs annually through 2014 the contract stipulates minimum price commitments based in part on market prices and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs 

 

we are a party to various potato supply agreements under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements we have guaranteed repayment of shortterm bank loans of the potato suppliers under certain conditions at may 31 2009 the amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was approximately 40 million included in the table above we have not established a liability for these guarantees as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote 

 

we are a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing company we have guaranteed repayment of a loan of this supplier under certain conditions at may 31 2009 the amount of this loan was 25 million included in the table above in the event of default on this loan by the supplier we have the contractual right to purchase the loan from the lender thereby giving us the rights to underlying collateral we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee as we believe the likelihood of financial exposure to us under this agreement is remote 

 

the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for income taxes under fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as amended as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 31 2009 was 75 million 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management 

 

our audit committee has reviewed management’s development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

 

marketing costs —we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs which include advertising retailer incentives and consumer incentives we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to retailers management must continually assess the likelihood of the retailer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

 

in fiscal 2009 we entered into approximately 120000 individual marketing programs with customers resulting in annual costs in excess of 25 billion which are reflected as a reduction of net sales changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any of the individual customer marketing programs would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows 

 

advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled 399 million 393 million and 451 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

income taxes —our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is 

required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under financial accounting standards board interpretation fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  management reviews our tax positions quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup our known volumetric contribution other potentially responsible parties and our experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup management’s estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above management’s estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

 

we have recognized a reserve of approximately 89 million for environmental liabilities as of may 31 2009 historically the underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy 

 

employmentrelated benefits —we incur certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers’ compensation in order to measure the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances we use thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 

 

we recognized pension expense from company plans of 38 million 56 million and 75 million in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively which reflected expected returns on plan assets of 159 million 149 million and 134 million respectively we contributed 112 million 8 million and 172 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 34 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2010 

 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate we select a discount rate each year as of our fiscal yearend measurement date for fiscal 2008 and thereafter for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans the hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moody’s aa available at the measurement date based on this information the discount rate 

selected by us for determination of pension expense was 66 for fiscal year 2009 and 575 for fiscal 2008 and 2007 we selected a discount rate of 69 for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2010 a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by 14 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by 15 million for the year a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately 16 million for fiscal 2010 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 17 million for fiscal 2010 for our yearend pension obligation determination we selected a discount rate of 69 and 66 for fiscal year 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense we consider longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plan’s investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information we selected 775 for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2009 pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 5 million we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2010 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 5 million 

 

when calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans we use a marketrelated value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses differences between actual return and expected return over five years the marketrelated value of assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2009 was 266 million lower than the actual fair value of plan assets 

 

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans we determine this assumption based on our longterm plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions based on this information we selected 425 for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 as the rate of compensation increase for determining our yearend pension obligation we selected 425 for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year we selected a rate of 425 for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2010 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would increasedecrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year 

 

we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits we recognized postretirement benefit expense of 15 million 23 million and 10 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we reflected liabilities of 281 million and 378 million in our balance sheets as of may 31 2009 and may 25 2008 respectively we anticipate contributing approximately 34 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2010 

 

the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 64 for fiscal year 2009 and 55 for fiscal 2008 and 2007 we have selected a discount rate of 66 for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2010 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 85 with the trend rate 

decreasing to 55 by 2013 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect 

 

 

 

we provide workers’ compensation benefits to our employees the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation the discount rate used at may 31 2009 was 42 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers’ compensation expense 

 

impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets —we reduce the carrying amounts of longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular assets being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 

 

we utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brandstrademarks the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand when determining the future cash flow estimates we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends 

 

in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital as the calculated fair value of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2009 and 2008 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies these fluctuations impacted raw material and energy costs of all reporting segments as well as our trading and merchandising activities which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our financial statements 

 

commodities —we purchase commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products sugar natural gas electricity and packaging materials to be used in our operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk we enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments we have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses we also monitor the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions in addition during our ownership of the trading and merchandising business divested during quarter one of fiscal 2009 we purchased and sold certain commodities such as wheat corn soybeans soybean meal soybean oil oats natural gas and crude oil presented in discontinued operations 

 

the following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes in practice as markets move we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate 

 

fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on our net derivative position by commodity at each quarterend during the fiscal year 

 

the market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying commodity positions that are being hedged the values of commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative commodity instrument 

 

effect of 10 change in market prices 

 

 

 

interest rates —we may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt at the end of fiscal 2009 and 2008 we did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding 

 

as of may 31 2009 and may 25 2008 the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at 37 billion based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors as of may 31 2009 and may 25 2008 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 196 million and 228 million respectively while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 307 million and 258 million respectively 

 

foreign operations —in order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our processing operations this activity primarily relates to hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 

the following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis for our processing operations sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in exchange rates actual changes in exchange rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

 

fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates and was based on our net foreign currency position at each quarterend during the fiscal year

general 

the following comments pertain to each of the company’s reporting segments 

conagra foods is a food company that operates principally in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded and valueadded consumer products conagra foods uses many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in the products of conagra foods generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors the company believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources the company has faced increased costs for many of its significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs the company seeks to mitigate the higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption the company expects to take further price increases during fiscal 2009 

  

the company experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets the company’s products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private label and customized products some of the company’s competitors are larger and have greater resources than the company the company has major competitors in each of its reporting segments the company competes primarily on the bases of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition the company conducts research activities related to the development of new products research and development expense was 69 million 68 million and 54 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

demand for certain of the company’s products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

the company manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes from time to time are not significant 

the company’s trademarks are of material importance to its business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related products are sold some of the company’s products are sold under brands that have been licensed from others the company also actively develops and maintains a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole the company has proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

many of conagra foods’ facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products sanitation safety and environmental control the company believes that it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or the competitive position of the company 

the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 15 15 and 13 of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively primarily in the consumer foods segment 

at may 25 2008 conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 25000 employees primarily in the united states approximately 52 of the company’s employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements of which approximately 34 are parties to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire during fiscal 2009

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following factors could affect the company’s operating results and should be considered in evaluating the company 

continuing increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

the company uses many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs the company may not be able to increase its product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability the company has experience in hedging against commodity price increases however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or margin for the company 

the food industry is highly competitive and increased competition can reduce sales for the company due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict the company’s ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases the company’s profit margins could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

the sophistication and buying power of the company’s customers could have a negative impact on profits 

many of the company’s customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue these consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for company products for their private label products the company is implementing initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label competition the company’s profitability could decline 

the company must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of the company’s food products depends on the company’s ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if the company’s products fail to meet consumer preference then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and the company’s strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful 

  

if the company does not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry its profitability could decrease 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and be efficient in the highly competitive food industry particularly in light of rising input costs the company is currently implementing profitenhancing initiatives that impact its supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on cost savings opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels if the company does not continue to manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies its competitiveness and its profitability could decrease 

the company may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact its profitability 

the company sells food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering and other adulteration of food products the company may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of its products causes injury illness or death in addition the company will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage in the past the company has issued recalls and has from time to time been and currently is involved in lawsuits relating to its food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact the company’s sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competitive reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that company products caused illness or injury could adversely affect the company’s reputation with existing and potential customers and its corporate and brand image 

if the company fails to comply with the many laws applicable to its business it may incur significant fines and penalties 

the company’s facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the company’s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties and injunctive relief civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of its products the company’s operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity 

the company’s information technology resources must provide efficient connections between its business functions or its results of operations will be negatively impacted 

each year the company engages in several billion dollars of transactions with its customers and vendors because the amount of dollars involved is so significant the company’s information technology resources must provide connections among its marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service and accounting functions if the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain the related computerized and manual control processes it could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches the company is currently implementing new financial and operational information technology systems some systems were placed into production during fiscal 2008 additional changes and enhancements will be placed into production at various times in fiscal 2009 and 2010 if future implementation problems are encountered the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted

operating initiatives 

conagra foods is implementing operational improvement initiatives that are intended to generate profitable sales growth improve profit margins and expand returns on capital over time 

recent developments in the company’s strategies and action plans include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 references to the company’s restructuring plans “the plans” refer to both the 20062008 restructuring plan and the 20082009 restructuring plan unless otherwise noted 

 

  

 discontinued operations  the results of operations for the trading and merchandising operations principally comprising the trading and merchandising reporting segment which were divested in june 2008 subsequent to the company’s fiscal 2008 year end the knott’s berry farm ® jelly and jam operations which were divested in may 2008 and the packaged meats and packaged cheese businesses which were divested in fiscal 2007 are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented 

capital allocation 

during fiscal 2008 the company funded the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the company has repurchased its shares from time to time based on market conditions the company began fiscal 2008 with an authorization to purchase up to 88 million of its common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions during fiscal 2008 the board of directors authorized management to 

  

repurchase up to an additional 500 million of the company’s common stock subsequent to fiscal 2008 the company’s authorization was increased an additional 500 million the company initiated an accelerated share repurchase program during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 under which it will exhaust its current share repurchase authorization through the expenditure of up to 900 million to repurchase its common stock 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 the board of directors increased the rate of regular quarterly dividends on the company’s common stock to 019 per common share 

on june 23 2008 the company completed the sale of its trading and merchandising operations principally comprising its trading and merchandising reporting segment proceeds were comprised of 1 approximately 22 billion of cash net of transaction costs including incentive compensation amounts due to conagra trade group employees 2 paidinkind debt securities issued by the purchaser with aggregate principal amount of 550 million to be recorded at fair market value of 483 million 3 a shortterm receivable of 37 million due from the purchaser and 4 a warrant to purchase approximately 5 of the equity of the purchaser to be recorded at estimated fair market value of 2 million the company expects to use the cash proceeds to complete the share repurchase discussed above and to significantly reduce its commercial paper balances 

opportunities and challenges 

the company believes that its operating initiatives will favorably impact future sales profits profit margins and returns on capital because of the scope of change underway there is risk that these broad change initiatives will not be successfully implemented input costs competitive pressures the ability to execute the operational changes and implement pricing actions among other factors will affect the timing and impact of these initiatives 

the company has faced increased costs for many of its significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs the company seeks to mitigate the higher input costs through pricing and productivity initiatives and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption the company expects to take further price increases during fiscal 2009 the company is also focusing on selling general and administrative cost initiatives as evidenced by the initiation of the company’s restructuring plans however the company expects higher input costs to continue into fiscal 2009 if the benefits from pricing actions supply chain productivity improvements economic hedges and selling general and administrative cost reduction initiatives are insufficient to cover these expected higher input costs results of operations particularly consumer foods operating profit may continue to be negatively impacted 

changing consumer preferences may impact sales of certain of the company’s products the company offers a variety of food products which appeal to a range of consumer preferences and utilizes innovation and marketing programs to develop products that fit with changing consumer trends as part of these programs the company introduces new products and product extensions 

consolidation of many of the company’s customers continues to result in increased buying power negotiating strength and complex service requirements for those customers this trend which is expected to continue may negatively impact gross margins particularly in the consumer foods segment in order to effectively respond to this customer consolidation the company is continually evaluating its consumer marketing sales and customer service strategies the company is implementing trade promotion programs designed to improve return on investment and pursuing shelf placement and customer service improvement initiatives 

other significant items of note—items impacting comparability 

the company faced two significant product recalls during fiscal 2007 and 2008 that impact comparability of results in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 the company initiated the recall of all varieties of peanut butter

 segment review 

the company reports its continuing operations in three reporting segments consumer foods food and ingredients and international foods 

  

consumer foods 

the consumer foods reporting segment includes branded private label and customized food products which are sold in various retail and foodservice channels the products include a variety of categories meals entrees condiments sides snacks and desserts across frozen refrigerated and shelfstable temperature classes 

food and ingredients 

the food and ingredients reporting segment includes commercially branded foods and ingredients which are sold principally to foodservice food manufacturing and industrial customers the segment’s primary products include specialty potato products milled grain ingredients dehydrated vegetables and seasonings blends and flavors 

international foods 

the international foods reporting segment includes branded food products which are sold in retail channels principally in north america europe and asia the products include a variety of categories meals entrees condiments sides snacks and desserts across frozen refrigerated and shelfstable temperature classes 

at the beginning of fiscal 2008 the company shifted management responsibility of its handheld product operations into the consumer foods segment from the food and ingredients segment and a portion of its international snack export business from the consumer foods segment to the international foods segment accordingly all prior periods have been recharacterized to reflect these changes 

in fiscal 2008 the company’s board of directors approved the 20082009 restructuring plan which was recommended by executive management to streamline the company’s international operations and to improve the efficiency of the company’s consumer foods and related functional organizations the plan includes the reorganization of the consumer foods operations integration of the international headquarters function into the company’s domestic consumer foods business exiting of a number of international markets and reducing administrative headcount together these actions are intended to reduce manufacturing and selling general and administrative costs and improve operating margins the company has also begun transitioning the direct management of the consumer foods reporting segment to the chief executive officer as a result of these plans which are expected to be fully implemented early in fiscal 2009 the company expects to change its reporting segments beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 

2008 vs 2007 

net sales 

 in millions 

 

 overall company net sales increased 11 billion to 116 billion in fiscal 2008 reflecting increased pricing in the milling and specialty potato operations of the food and ingredients segment and increased volume and pricing in the consumer foods segment 

  

consumer foods net sales increased 303 million or 5 for the year to 68 billion results reflect an increase of three percentage points from improved net pricing and product mix and two percentage points of improvement from higher volumes net pricing and volume improvements were achieved in many of the company’s priority investment and enabler brands the impact of product recalls partially offset these improvements the company implemented significant price increases for many consumer foods products during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 continued net sales improvements are expected into fiscal 2009 when the company expects to receive the benefit of these pricing actions for full fiscal periods sales of some of the company’s most significant brands including chef boyardee ®  david ®  egg beaters ®  healthy choice ®  hebrew national ®  hunt’s ®  marie callender’s ®  manwich ®  orville redenbacher’s ®  pam ®  rotel ®  rosarita ®  snack pack ®  swiss miss ®  wesson ®  and wolf ® grew in fiscal 2008 sales of act ii ®  andy capp ®  banquet ®  crunch ‘n munch ®  kid cuisine ®  parkay ®  pemmican ®  reddiwip ®  and slim jim ® declined in fiscal 2008 

net sales in the consumer foods segment are not comparable across periods due to a variety of factors the company initiated a peanut butter recall in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and reintroduced peter pan ® peanut butter products in august 2007 sales of all peanut butter products including both branded and private label in fiscal 2008 were 14 million lower than comparable amounts in fiscal 2007 consumer foods net sales were also adversely impacted by the recall of banquet ® and private label pot pies in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 net sales of pot pies were lower by approximately 22 million in fiscal 2008 relative to fiscal 2007 primarily due to product returns and lost sales of banquet ® and private label pot pies sales from alexia foods and lincoln snacks businesses acquired in fiscal 2008 totaled 66 million in fiscal 2008 the company divested a refrigerated pizza business during the first half of fiscal 2007 sales from this business were 17 million in fiscal 2007 

food and ingredients net sales were 41 billion in fiscal 2008 an increase of 706 million or 21 increased sales are reflective of higher sales prices in the company’s milling operations due to higher grain prices and price and volume increases in the company’s potato and dehydrated vegetable operations the fiscal 2007 divestiture of an oat milling operation resulted in a reduction of sales of 27 million for fiscal 2008 partially offset by increased sales of 18 million from the acquisition of watts brothers in february 2008 

international foods net sales increased 65 million to 678 million the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar accounted for approximately 36 million of this increase the segment achieved a 5 increase in sales volume in fiscal 2008 primarily reflecting increased unit sales in canada and mexico and modest increases in net pricing 

gross profit 

net sales less cost of goods sold 

 in millions 

 

 the company’s gross profit for fiscal 2008 was 27 billion an increase of 23 million or 1 over the prior year the increase in gross profit was largely driven by results in the food and ingredients segment reflecting higher margins in the company’s milling and specialty potato operations largely offset by reduced gross profits in the consumer foods segment costs of implementing the company’s restructuring plans reduced gross profit by 4 million and 46 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively 

  

consumer foods gross profit for fiscal 2008 was 18 billion a decrease of 121 million or 6 from the prior year the decrease in gross profit reflected significantly higher input costs partially offset by improved net pricing mix and volume the increased input costs were partially offset by productivity improvements and gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs the factors impacting comparability of consumer foods net sales also impact the comparability of consumer foods gross profit due to the peanut butter recall that was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the subsequent reintroduction of peter pan ® peanut butter products in august 2007 gross profits in the consumer foods segment are not comparable across periods consumer foods gross profit from all peanut butter products including both branded and private label in fiscal 2008 were 22 million lower than comparable amounts in fiscal 2007 consumer foods gross profit on banquet ® and private label pot pies products were lower by approximately 23 million in fiscal 2008 relative to fiscal 2007 primarily due to product returns and lost sales newly acquired businesses contributed 11 million to gross profit in fiscal 2008 costs of implementing the company’s restructuring plans reduced gross profit for fiscal 2008 and 2007 by 2 million and 45 million respectively 

food and ingredients gross profit was 724 million for fiscal 2008 an increase of 134 million or 23 over the prior year improved results reflect increased gross profit of 68 million in the company’s milling operations due to a favorable wheat commodity environment and improved flour conversion margins the company also achieved increased gross profit of 65 million in its specialty potato business as benefits from pricing volume growth and product mix management exceeded the impact of higher input costs results also reflected gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs as well as profits from wheat derivatives trading 

international foods gross profit was 190 million an increase of 10 million over the prior fiscal year fiscal 2008 performance reflected increased sales volume of 5 partially offset by higher input costs modest net pricing increases and a benefit of 11 million due to favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes gross profit for fiscal 2008 also reflects 2 million of charges related to the execution of the company’s restructuring plans 

gross margin 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales 

 

 the company’s gross margin for fiscal 2008 decreased three percentage points compared to fiscal 2007 primarily reflecting the impact of significantly increased input costs in the consumer foods segment which were not offset by net price increases and productivity improvements the company implemented price increases in march of fiscal 2008 the benefits of which are expected to be greater in future periods the gross margin in the consumer foods segment has also been negatively impacted in both fiscal 2008 and 2007 by the costs of product recalls and the costs of implementing the company’s restructuring plans gross margin in the food and ingredients segment improved due to the factors noted above under “gross profit” 

selling general and administrative expenses includes general corporate expense “sga” 

sga expenses totaled 18 billion for fiscal 2008 virtually unchanged from the prior fiscal year 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008 reflected the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 included in sga expenses for fiscal 2007 were the following items 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 operating profit 

earnings before general corporate expense interest expense net income taxes and equity method investment earnings 

 in millions 

 

 consumer foods operating profit decreased 67 million in fiscal 2008 versus the prior year to 781 million the decrease for the fiscal year was reflective of the decreased gross profit discussed above and was influenced by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

 food and ingredients operating profit increased 77 million to 512 million in fiscal 2008 operating profit improvement was principally driven by the improved gross profit as discussed above other factors affecting the increased operating profit included higher selling expense and compensation costs in fiscal 2008 and gains recorded in fiscal 2007 of 18 million related to the company’s sale of an oat milling business and 8 million resulting from a legal settlement related to a fire 

  

international foods operating profit decreased 15 million to 49 million in fiscal 2008 operating profit included the increase in gross profit offset by 16 million of costs associated with the implementation of the company’s restructuring plans fiscal 2007 operating profit included a gain of approximately 4 million related to the sale of certain international licensing rights for a small brand and 2 million of charges related to the peanut butter recall 

interest expense net 

in fiscal 2008 net interest expense was 253 million an increase of 34 million or 15 over the prior fiscal year increased interest expense reflects the company’s use of commercial paper to finance higher working capital balances in all segments particularly in the trading and merchandising business which is now presented within discontinued operations the company also earned less interest income due to lower balances of cash on hand in fiscal 2008 

equity method investment earnings 

the company includes its share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on its economic ownership interest in the affiliates significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers the company’s share of earnings from the company’s equity method investments were 50 million and 28 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase was driven by improved performance of a foreign potato venture 

results of discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations was 412 million net of tax in fiscal 2008 included in these amounts are 

 

  

 income from discontinued operations was 282 million net of tax in fiscal 2007 included in these amounts are 

 

  

  

  

 income taxes and net income 

the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings was 31 for fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2008 the company adjusted its estimates of income taxes payable due to increased benefits from a domestic manufacturing deduction and lower foreign income taxes resulting in a lower than normal effective tax rate these impacts and tax benefits related to a change in the legal structure of the company’s subsidiaries are the primary contributors to the decrease in the yeartodate effective tax rate from fiscal 2007

food and ingredients net sales increased 293 million to 34 billion primarily reflecting price and volume increases for potato and dehydrated vegetable operations as well as price increases in the wheat milling operations resulting from higher year over year grain prices 

international foods net sales increased 2 million to 613 million the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar accounted for a 6 million increase growth of the priority investment brands primarily in canada and mexico was offset by sales declines related to the discontinuance of a number of low margin products and the effect of the peanut butter recall

commercial paper borrowings usually less than 30 days maturity are reflected in the company’s consolidated balance sheets within notes payable at may 25 2008 the company had credit lines from banks that totaled approximately 23 billion these lines are comprised of a 15 billion multiyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions which matures in december 2011 uncommitted shortterm loan facilities approximating 364 million and uncommitted trade finance facilities approximating 424 million the multiyear facility is a backup facility for the company’s commercial paper program borrowings under the multiyear facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty these rates are approximately 10 to 15 percentage points higher than the interest rates for commercial paper the company has not drawn upon this multiyear facility as of may 25 2008 the company had shortterm notes payable of 578 million that were comprised primarily of commercial paper the multiyear facility requires the company to repay borrowings if the company’s consolidated funded debt exceeds 65 of the consolidated capital base as defined or if fixed charges coverage as defined is less than 175 to 10 as such terms are defined in applicable agreements as of the end of fiscal 2008 the company was in compliance with these financial covenants 

the uncommitted trade finance facilities noted above were maintained in order to finance certain working capital needs of the company’s trading and merchandising operations subsequent to the sale of these operations in june 2008 the company exited these facilities 

the company finances its shortterm liquidity needs with bank borrowings commercial paper borrowings and bankers’ acceptances the average consolidated shortterm borrowings outstanding under these facilities were 419 million and 4 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in commercial paper borrowings was primarily due to higher working capital needs during the year principally in the recently divested trading and merchandising operations 

the company’s overall level of interestbearing longterm debt inclusive of current maturities totaled 35 billion at the end of both fiscal 2008 and 2007 in december 2006 the company completed an exchange of approximately 200 million principal amount of its 975 subordinated notes due 2021 and 300 million principal amount of its 675 senior notes due 2011 for approximately 500 million principal amount of 582 senior notes due 2017 and cash of approximately 90 million in order to improve the company’s debt maturity profile the company is amortizing the 90 million cash payment the unamortized portion of which is reflected as a reduction of senior longterm debt in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at may 25 2008 over the life of the new notes within interest expense

as of the end of both fiscal 2008 and 2007 the company’s senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings would not affect the company’s ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facilities although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade to the company’s shortterm credit ratings would also affect the company’s ability to borrow under its commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations as well as potentially limiting access 

the company also has an effective shelf registration statement under which it could issue from time to time up to 4 billion in debt securities 

in march 2006 the company completed the divestitures of its cook’s ham and its seafood businesses for cash proceeds of approximately 442 million during fiscal 2007 the company sold its refrigerated meats business its cheese business its refrigerated pizza business an oat milling business and a dietary supplement business for proceeds of approximately 717 million

the asset and liability amounts in the table above reflect gross positions and are not reduced for offsetting positions with a counterparty when a legal right of offset exists the “prices actively quoted” category reflects only contracts for which the fair value is based entirely upon prices actively quoted on major exchanges in the united states the “prices provided by other external sources” category represents contracts which contain a pricing component other than prices actively quoted on a major exchange such as forward commodity positions at locations for which overthecounter broker quotes are available 

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on the company’s historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of the company’s accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management of the company 

the company’s audit committee has reviewed management’s development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

marketing costs —the company incurs certain costs to promote its products through marketing programs which include advertising retailer incentives and consumer incentives the company recognizes the cost of each of these types of marketing activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to retailers management must continually assess the likelihood of the retailer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on the company’s historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and the company could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

historically the company has entered into over 150000 individual marketing programs each year with customers resulting in annual costs in excess of 2 billion which are reflected as a reduction of net sales 

  

changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any of the individual customer marketing programs would not result in a material change in the company’s results of operations or cash flows 

advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled 393 million 452 million and 334 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

income taxes —the company’s income tax expense is based on the company’s income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s income tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under financial accounting standards board interpretation fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  management reviews the company’s tax positions quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment management uses historical experience and short and longrange business forecasts to develop such estimates further the company employs various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess the company’s environmental liabilities management estimates the company’s environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup the known volumetric contribution of the company and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup management’s estimate as to its potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims the company does not discount its environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above management’s estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

the company has recognized a reserve of approximately 95 million for environmental liabilities as of may 25 2008 historically the underlying assumptions utilized by the company in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy 

employmentrelated benefits —the company incurs certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers’ compensation in order to measure the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to the company the estimates used by 

  

management are based on the company’s historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances the company uses thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in the company recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 

the company recognized pension expense of 65 million 83 million and 96 million in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively which reflected expected returns on plan assets of 149 million 134 million and 130 million respectively the company contributed 8 million 172 million and 36 million to the company’s pension plans in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the company anticipates contributing approximately 7 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2009 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate the company selects a discount rate each year as of its fiscal yearend measurement date for fiscal 2008 and thereafter for its plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for the company’s pension plans the hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moody’s aa available at the measurement date based on this information the discount rate selected by the company for determination of pension expense for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 was 575 the company selected a discount rate of 66 for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2009 a 25 basis point increase in the company’s discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would decrease pension expense for the company’s pension plans by 37 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in the company’s discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would increase pension expense for the company’s pension plans by 96 million for the year a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately 15 million for fiscal 2009 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 14 million for fiscal 2009 for its yearend pension obligation determination the company selected a discount rate of 66 and 575 for fiscal year 2008 and 2007 respectively 

another significant assumption used to account for the company’s pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense the company considers longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plan’s investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information the company selected 775 for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining its fiscal 2008 pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for the company’s pension plans by approximately 5 million the company selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2009 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for the company’s pension plans by approximately 5 million 

when calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans the company uses a marketrelated value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses differences between actual return and expected return over five years the marketrelated value of assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2008 was 257 million lower than the actual fair value of plan assets 

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans the company determines this assumption based on its longterm plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions based on this information the company selected 425 for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 as the rate of compensation increase for determining its yearend pension obligation the company selected 425 for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 a 25 basis point increase in the company’s rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would increase pension expense for the company’s pension plans by approximately 2 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in the company’s rate of compensation increase assumption as of the 

  

beginning of fiscal 2008 would decrease pension expense for the company’s pension plans by approximately 2 million for the year the company selected a rate of 425 for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2009 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the company’s rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would increasedecrease pension expense for the company’s pension plans by approximately 1 million for the year 

the company also provides certain postretirement health care benefits the company recognized postretirement benefit expense of 23 million 10 million and 18 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the company reflects liabilities of 378 million and 392 million in its balance sheets as of may 25 2008 and may 27 2007 respectively the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on the company’s assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate selected by the company for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 was 55 the company has selected a discount rate of 64 for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2009 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the company’s discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decreaseincrease postretirement expense for the company’s plans by approximately 1 million the company has assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 95 with the trend rate decreasing to 55 by 2013 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect 

 

 the company provides workers’ compensation benefits to its employees the measurement of the liability for the company’s cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption made by the company is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of its obligation the discount rate used at may 25 2008 was 50 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers’ compensation expense 

impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets —the company reduces the carrying amounts of longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular assets being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 

the company utilizes a “relief from royalty” methodology in evaluating impairment of its brandstrademarks the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated “royalty rate” the company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand as the calculated fair value of the company’s goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the company’s goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge

general 

the following comments pertain to each of the company’s reporting segments 

conagra foods is a food company that operates principally in many sectors of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded and valueadded consumer products conagra foods uses many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in the products of conagra foods generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors the company believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources the company has faced increased costs for many of its significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs inflationary pressures negatively impacted fiscal 2006 results but had less of an impact in fiscal 2005 the company’s productivity and pricing initiatives in fiscal 2007 effectively mitigated the impact of inflation however the company expects inflation in fiscal 2008 to exceed recent levels when appropriate the company uses longterm purchase contracts futures and options to reduce the volatility of certain raw materials costs 

  

the company experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets the company’s products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private label and customized products some of the company’s competitors are larger and have greater resources than the company the company has major competitors in each of its reporting segments the company competes primarily on the bases of quality value customer service brand recognition and brand loyalty 

quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition the company conducts research activities related to the development of new products research and development expense was 68 million 54 million and 64 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

demand for certain of the company’s products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events 

the company manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes from time to time are not significant 

the company’s trademarks are of material importance to its business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other markets where the related products are sold some of the company’s products are sold under brands that have been licensed from others the company also actively develops and maintains a portfolio of patents although no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole the company has proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

many of conagra foods’ facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products sanitation safety and environmental control the company believes that it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or the competitive position of the company 

the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 13 12 and 11 of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively primarily in the consumer foods segment 

at may 27 2007 conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 24500 employees primarily in the united states approximately 13000 of the company’s employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements the collective bargaining agreements to which approximately 5000 of the company’s employees are parties are scheduled to expire during fiscal 2008

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following factors could affect the company’s operating results and should be considered in evaluating the company 

the company must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of the company’s food products depends on the company’s ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if the company’s products fail to meet consumer preference then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and the company’s strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in core product lines will be less successful 

if the company does not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry its profitability could decrease 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and be efficient in the highly competitive food industry the company is currently implementing profitenhancing initiatives that impact its supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on cost savings opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels if the company does not continue to manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies its competitiveness and its profitability could decrease 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or margin for the company 

the food industry is highly competitive and increased competition can reduce sales for the company due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures competitive pressures also may restrict the company’s ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other cost increases the company’s profit margins could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

the consolidation of the company’s customers has resulted in large sophisticated customers with increased buying power 

the company’s customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for company products for their private label products the company is implementing initiatives to counteract these pressures however if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength andor increased private label competition the company’s profitability could decline 

  

the company may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact its profitability 

the company sells food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering and other adulteration of food products the company may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of its products causes injury illness or death in addition the company will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage in the past the company has issued recalls and has from time to time been involved in lawsuits relating to its food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact the company’s sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competitive reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that company products caused illness or injury could adversely affect the company’s reputation with existing and potential customers and its corporate and brand image for example during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 the company initiated a voluntary recall of all varieties of peanut butter manufactured at its sylvester georgia plant the costs of the recall negatively impacted net sales gross margin and operating profit in the consumer foods and international foods segments in fiscal 2007 and the company expects ongoing impacts to its business into early fiscal 2008 a number of lawsuits and claims related to the recalled product have been filed against the company 

if the company fails to comply with the many laws applicable to its business it may incur significant fines and penalties 

the company’s facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the company’s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties and injunctive relief civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of its products the company’s operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity 

volatility in commodity prices may have a negative impact on profits 

the company uses and trades many different commodities such as wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs the company may not be able to increase its product prices to offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability in the company’s trading operations the company may not be able to successfully capitalize from the volatility the company has many years’ experience in hedging against commodity price increases and trading in commodities however these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases 

the company’s information technology resources must provide efficient connections between its business functions or its results of operations will be negatively impacted 

each year the company engages in several billion dollars of transactions with its customers and vendors because the amount of dollars involved is so significant the company’s information technology resources must provide connections among its marketing sales manufacturing logistics customer service and accounting functions if the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain the related computerized and manual control processes it could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches 

  

in 2005 in connection with its implementation of project nucleus  the company’s information technology linking initiative the company had shortterm operational challenges during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 the company is currently implementing new financial and operational information technology systems which will be placed into production at various times in fiscal 2008 and 2009 if future implementation problems are encountered the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted

 opportunities and challenges 

the company believes that its operating initiatives will favorably impact future sales profits profit margins and returns on capital because of the scope of change underway there is risk that these broad change initiatives will not be successfully implemented competitive pressures input costs and the ability to execute the operational changes among other factors will affect the timing and impact of these initiatives 

the company has faced increased costs for many of its significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs inflationary pressures negatively impacted fiscal 2006 results but had less of an impact in fiscal 2005 the company’s productivity and pricing initiatives in fiscal 2007 effectively mitigated the impact of inflation however the company expects inflation in fiscal 2008 to exceed recent levels when appropriate the company uses longterm purchase contracts futures and options to reduce the volatility of certain raw materials costs 

changing consumer preferences may impact sales of certain of the company’s products the company offers a variety of food products which appeal to a range of consumer preferences and utilizes innovation and marketing programs to develop products that fit with changing consumer trends as part of these programs the company introduces new products and product extensions 

consolidation of many of the company’s customers continues to result in increased buying power negotiating strength and complex service requirements for those customers this trend which is expected to continue may negatively impact gross margins particularly in the consumer foods segment in order to effectively respond to this customer consolidation the company is continually evaluating its gotomarket strategies and its customer service costs the company is implementing improved trade promotion programs to drive improved return on investment and is pursuing shelf placement and customer service improvement initiatives

trading and merchandising gross profit for fiscal 2006 was 278 million a decrease of 4 million over the prior year gross profit declined 22 million in the trading businesses driven almost entirely by a difficult fertilizer market gross profit for the agricultural businesses increased 18 million driven by stronger trading gains in livestock and stronger margins in merchandising grain and animal byproducts

commercial paper borrowings usually less than 30 days maturity are reflected in the company’s consolidated balance sheets within notes payable 

at may 27 2007 the company had credit lines from banks that totaled approximately 22 billion these lines are comprised of a 15 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions and shortterm facilities approximating 693 million the fiveyear facility contains provisions substantially identical to those in the 105 billion facility it replaced the terms of the fiveyear facility provide that the company may request that the commitments available under the facility be extended for additional oneyear periods on an annual basis following such a request during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 the commitments under this facility were extended to december 2011 borrowings under the fiveyear facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty these rates are approximately 30 to 35 percentage points higher than the interest rates for commercial paper the company has not drawn upon the fiveyear facility as of may 27 2007 the company had 02 million drawn under the shortterm loan facilities the long and shortterm facilities require the company to repay borrowings if the company’s consolidated funded debt exceeds 65 of the consolidated capital base as defined or if fixed charges coverage as defined is less than 175 to 10 as such terms are defined in applicable agreements as of the end of fiscal 2007 the company was in compliance with these financial covenants 

the company finances its shortterm liquidity needs with bank borrowings commercial paper borrowings and bankers’ acceptances the average consolidated shortterm borrowings outstanding under these facilities were 4 million and 14 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively 

the companys overall level of interestbearing debt totaled 35 billion at the end of fiscal 2007 compared to 36 billion as of the end of fiscal 2006 in december 2006 the company completed an exchange of approximately 200 million principal amount of its 975 subordinated notes due 2021 and 300 million 

  

principal amount of its 675 senior notes due 2011 for approximately 500 million principal amount of 582 senior notes due 2017 and cash of approximately 90 million in order to improve the company’s debt maturity profile the company is amortizing the 90 million cash payment the unamortized portion of which is reflected as a reduction of senior longterm debt in the company’s consolidated balance sheet at may 27 2007 over the life of the new notes within interest expense 

during fiscal 2007 the company redeemed 12 million of 88 unsecured debt due in may 2017 this early retirement of debt which resulted in a pretax loss of 04 million recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 is included in selling general and administrative expenses

included in current installments of longterm debt as of may 28 2006 was 400 million of 7125 senior debt due october 2026 due to the existence of a put option that was exercisable by the holders of the debt from august 1 2006 to september 1 2006 the holders did not exercise the put option and therefore the company reclassified the 400 million balance to senior longterm debt in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 when the put option expired

as of the end of both fiscal 2007 and 2006 the company’s senior longterm debt ratings were all investment grade ratings a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings would not affect the company’s ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facilities although borrowing costs would increase a downgrade to the company’s shortterm credit ratings would also impact the company’s ability to borrow under its commercial paper program by causing increased borrowing costs and shorter durations and could result in possible access limitations

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company uses offbalance sheet arrangements eg operating leases where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use the company periodically enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business these are described further in “obligations and commitments” below 

  

the company consolidates the assets and liabilities of several entities from which it leases office buildings and corporate aircraft these entities have been determined to be variable interest entities and the company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of these entities due to the consolidation of these entities the company reflects in its balance sheet property plant and equipment of 156 million and 183 million other assets of 14 million and 12 million longterm debt of 150 million including current maturities of 6 million and 192 million including current maturities of 8 million minority interest liabilities of 22 million and 6 million and other accrued liabilities of 1 million and 0 as of may 27 2007 and may 28 2006 respectively the liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these entities do not represent additional claims on the general assets of the company the creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities 

obligations and commitments 

as part of its ongoing operations the company enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as “takeorpay” contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into by the company in its normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available to the company capital lease and debt obligations which totaled 36 billion at may 27 2007 are currently recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations which totaled 645 million at may 27 2007 are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

a summary of the company’s contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2007 is as follows including obligations of discontinued operations 

 

 the company’s total obligations of approximately 42 billion reflect a decrease of approximately 237 million from the company’s 2006 fiscal yearend the decrease was due primarily to a reduction of lease obligations in connection with the sale of the packaged meats operations 

the company is also contractually obligated to pay interest on its longterm debt obligations the weighted average interest rate of the longterm debt obligations outstanding as of may 27 2007 was approximately 72 

  

as part of its ongoing operations the company also enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event eg guarantee debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet the company’s commitments including commitments associated with equity method investments as of the end of fiscal 2007 are as follows including commitments of discontinued operations 

 

 the company’s total commitments of approximately 35 million include approximately 28 million in guarantees and other commitments the company has made on behalf of the company’s divested fresh beef and pork business 

as part of the fresh beef and pork divestiture the company guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork business with respect to a hog purchase contract the hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 12 million hogs annually through 2014 the contract stipulates minimum price commitments based in part on market prices and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs 

trading activities 

the company accounts for certain contracts eg “physical” commodity purchasesale contracts and derivative contracts at fair value the company considers a portion of these contracts to be its “trading” activities specifically those contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related amendment sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities collectively “sfas no 133” the following table represents the fair value and scheduled maturity dates of trading contracts outstanding as of may 27 2007 

 

 in order to minimize the risk of loss associated with nonexchangetraded transactions with counterparties the company utilizes established credit limits and performs ongoing counterparty credit evaluations 

the above table excludes commoditybased contracts entered into in the normal course of business including “physical” contracts to buy or sell commodities at agreedupon fixed prices as well as derivative contracts eg futures and options used primarily to hedge an existing asset or liability eg inventory or an 

  

anticipated transaction eg purchase of inventory the use of such contracts is not considered by the company to be “trading” activities as these contracts are considered either normal purchase and sale contracts or hedging contracts the asset and liability amounts in this table reflect gross positions and are not reduced for offsetting positions with a counterparty when a legal right of offset exists the “prices actively quoted” category reflects only contracts for which the fair value is based entirely upon prices actively quoted on major exchanges in the united states the “prices provided by other external sources” category represents contracts which contain a pricing component other than prices actively quoted on a major exchange such as forward commodity positions at locations for which overthecounter broker quotes are available 

critical accounting estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on the company’s historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of the company’s accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management of the company 

the company’s audit committee has reviewed management’s development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

marketing costs —the company incurs certain costs to promote its products through marketing programs which include advertising retailer incentives and consumer incentives the company recognizes the cost of each of these types of marketing activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to retailers management must continually assess the likelihood of the retailer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on the company’s historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and the company could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time 

advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled 452 million 335 million and 318 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

historically the company has entered into over 150000 individual marketing programs each year resulting in annual costs in excess of 2 billion which are reflected as a reduction of net sales changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any of the individual marketing programs would not result in a material change in the company’s results of operations or cash flows 

income taxes —the company recognizes current tax liabilities and assets based on an estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current year for each of the jurisdictions in which the company transacts business as part of the determination of its current tax liability management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating positions taken by the company in its tax returns the company has established reserves for probable tax exposures these reserves included in current tax liabilities represent the company’s estimate of amounts expected to be paid which the company adjusts over time as more information becomes available 

the company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences eg the difference in book basis versus tax basis of fixed assets resulting from differing depreciation methods if appropriate the company recognizes valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized based on the company’s assessment of estimated future taxable income including the consideration of available tax planning strategies 

  

the calculation of current and deferred tax assets including valuation allowances and liabilities requires management to apply significant judgment related to the application of complex tax laws changes in tax laws or related interpretations uncertainties related to the outcomes of tax audits and changes in the company’s operations or other facts and circumstances further management must continually monitor changes in these factors changes in such factors may result in changes to management estimates and could require the company to adjust its tax assets and liabilities and record additional income tax expense or benefits 

environmental liabilities —environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess the company’s environmental liabilities management estimates the company’s environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup the known volumetric contribution of the company and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup management’s estimate as to its potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims the company does not discount its environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above management’s estimate of environmental liabilities may also change 

the company has recognized a reserve of approximately 100 million for environmental liabilities as of may 27 2007 historically the underlying assumptions utilized by the company in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy 

employmentrelated benefits —the company incurs certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers’ compensation in order to measure the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to the company the estimates used by management are based on the company’s historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances the company uses thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in the company recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 

the company recognized pension expense of 83 million 96 million and 71 million in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively which reflected expected returns on plan assets of 134 million 130 million and 131 million respectively the company contributed 172 million 36 million and 9 million to the company’s pension plans in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the company anticipates contributing approximately 13 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2008 

one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate the company selects a discount rate each year as of its february 28 measurement date for its plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the yearbyyear projected benefit cash flows for the company’s pension plans the hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of highquality fixed income debt instruments usually moody’s aa available at the measurement date based on this information the discount rates selected by the company for determination of pension expense for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 

  

2005 were 575 575 and 60 respectively the company selected a discount rate of 575 for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2008 a 25 basis point increase in the company’s discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 would decrease pension expense for the company’s pension plans by 92 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in the company’s discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 would increase pension expense for the company’s pension plans by 97 million for the year a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately 37 million for fiscal 2008 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 96 million for fiscal 2008 for its yearend pension obligation determination the company selected a discount rate of 575 for fiscal year 2007 and 2006 

another significant assumption used to account for the company’s pension plans is the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense the company considers longterm historical returns arithmetic average of the plan’s investments the asset allocation among types of investments estimated longterm returns by investment type from external sources and the current economic environment based on this information the company selected 775 for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for determining its fiscal 2007 pension expense a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 would decreaseincrease annual pension expense for the company’s pension plans by approximately 44 million the company selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 775 to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2008 

when calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans the company uses a marketrelated value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses differences between actual return and expected return over five years the marketrelated value of assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2007 was 189 million lower than the actual fair value of plan assets 

the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans the company determines this assumption based on its longterm plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions based on this information the company selected 425 for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 as the rate of compensation increase for determining its yearend pension obligation the company selected 425 425 and 45 for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively a 25 basis point increase in the company’s rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 would increase pension expense for the company’s pension plans by approximately 2 million for the year a 25 basis point decrease in the company’s rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 would decrease pension expense for the company’s pension plans by approximately 2 million for the year the company selected a rate of 425 for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2008 

the company also provides certain postretirement health care benefits the company recognized postretirement benefit expense of 10 million 18 million and 27 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the company reflects liabilities of 392 million and 340 million in its balance sheets as of may 27 2007 and may 28 2006 respectively the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on the company’s assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts these assumptions include discount rates discussed above health care cost trend rates inflation rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the discount rate selected by the company for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 was 55 55 and 60 respectively the company has selected a discount rate of 55 for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2008 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the company’s discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would decreaseincrease postretirement 

  

expense for the company’s plans by 12 million the company has assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 95 with the trend rate decreasing to 50 by 2013 a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect 

 

 the company provides workers’ compensation benefits to its employees the measurement of the liability for the company’s cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs one significant assumption made by the company is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of its obligation the discount rate used at may 27 2007 was 50 a 25 basis point increasedecrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers’ compensation expense 

impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets —the company reduces the carrying amounts of longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular assets being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 

the company utilizes a “relief from royalty” methodology in evaluating impairment of its brandstrademarks the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated “royalty rate” the company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand as the calculated fair value of the company’s goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the company’s goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value this provides entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without being required to apply complex hedge accounting provisions the provisions of sfas no 159 are effective as of the beginning of the company’s fiscal 2009 management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 159 on the company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations

general 

  

the following comments pertain to each of the company’s reporting segments 

  

conagra foods is a food company that operates in many different areas of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded and valueadded consumer products conagra foods uses many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in the products of conagra foods generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental 

  

  

agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors the company believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources the company uses hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials however it does not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not fully protect the company or its subsidiaries from increases in specific raw material costs 

  

the company experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets the company’s products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private label and customized products the company has major competitors in each of its reporting segments 

  

quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition the company conducts research activities related to the development of new products 

  

many of conagra foods’ facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products sanitation safety and environmental control the company believes that it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or the competitive position of the company 

  

at may 30 2004 conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 39000 employees primarily in the united states 

  

d foreign operations 

  

foreign operations information is set forth in note 19 “business segments and related information” to the consolidated financial statements 

  

e available information   the company makes available free of charge through its internet website at httpwwwconagrafoodscom its annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission 

  

risk factors 

  

the following factors could affect the company’s operating results and should be considered in evaluating the company 

  

the company must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

  

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of the company’s food products depends on the company’s ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences the company introduces new products and improved products in all of its business segments from time to time and incurs significant development and marketing costs if the company’s products fail to meet consumer preference then the company’s strategy to grow sales and profits with new products will be less successful 

  

if the company does not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry its profitability could decrease 

  

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and be efficient 

  

  

in the highly competitive food industry the company is currently implementing profitenhancing initiatives that impact its marketing sales operations and information systems functions these initiatives include elimination of duplicative costs and overhead consolidation of selected plants and support functions efforts to streamline and improve the company’s ability to do business with its customers distributors and brokers and realignment of business organizations if the company does not continue to manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies its competitiveness and its profitability could decrease 

  

increased competition may result in reduced sales for the company 

  

the food industry is highly competitive and increased competition can reduce sales for the company 

  

the consolidation of the company’s retail customers has resulted in large sophisticated customers with increased buying power 

  

the company’s retail customers such as supermarkets and warehouse clubs have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for company products for their private label products if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength or less shelf space for company products the company’s profitability could decline 

  

the company may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact its profitability 

  

the company sells food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering and other adulteration of food products the company may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of its products causes injury illness or death in addition the company will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage in the past the company has issued recalls and has from time to time been involved in lawsuits relating to its food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact the company’s profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competitive reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that company products caused illness or injury could adversely affect the company’s reputation with existing and potential customers and its corporate and brand image 

  

commodity price increases will increase operating costs and may reduce profits 

  

the company uses many different commodities including wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs the company may not be able to increase its product prices to offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability the company has many years’ experience in hedging against commodity price increases however hedging practices reduce but do not eliminate the risk of increased operating costs from commodity price increases for example higher commodity prices in fiscal 2004 which were not fully offset by higher selling prices negatively affected the company’s operating profit 

  

if the company fails to comply with the many laws applicable to its business it may incur significant fines and penalties 

  

the company’s facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the company’s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties and injunctive relief civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of its products the company’s operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and 

  

  

disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity

consolidation of many of the company’s customers continues to result in increased buying power negotiating strength and complex service requirements for those customers this trend which is expected to continue may negatively impact gross margins particularly in the retail products segment in order to effectively respond to this customer consolidation during fiscal 2004 the company consolidated its sales force to more efficiently service its customers and to appropriately leverage the company’s scale in fiscal 2003 the company’s retail customer service centers were consolidated into one specialized facility to service all retail channel customers the company continues to streamline its distribution network in order to reduce costs and increase its responsiveness to customer needs

2004 vs 2003 

  

net sales 

  

   

overall company net sales declined 24 billion to 145 billion primarily reflecting the impact of the fresh beef and pork divestiture in fiscal 2003 and the sale of the canned seafood and processed cheeserelated operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 prior year sales included approximately 31 billion from the divested businesses while current year sales included none these decreases were partially offset by the 289 million estimated impact on net sales of one additional week included in the results of operations for fiscal 2004 the company believes that its sales and marketing initiatives discussed in the “executive overview” have begun to favorably influence brand performance 

  

retail products net sales declined 234 million for the year to 84 billion included in results for fiscal 2003 were net sales of 493 million from the canned seafood business which was divested in fiscal 2003 this decrease was partially offset by the estimated impact of one additional week included in the results of operations for fiscal 2004 an increase to net sales of approximately 165 million sales of the company’s key branded products showed mixed results as sales of some of the company’s most significant brands including banquet chef boyardee wesson slim jim pam egg beaters and reddiwip grew on a comparable fiftytwo week basis major brands 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

posting sales declines for the year included healthy choice butterball armour act ii and orville redenbacher’s in addition to the sales and marketing initiatives previously discussed new products and product extensions in the frozen meals and entrees category such as banquet crockpot classics and life choice positively impacted the retail products segment net sales for the year weak sales volume in popcorn products driven by intense competition in the category and consumer trends negatively impacted the segment’s performance 

  

net sales in the foodservice products segment were 37 billion an increase of 116 million included in results for fiscal 2003 were net sales of 93 million from divested businesses the estimated impact of the inclusion of one additional week of net sales in fiscal 2004 was an increase of approximately 70 million sales of specialty potato products and shelfstable and specialty meats within the culinary product line achieved increased sales volumes during fiscal 2004 improved unit pricing within the specialty potato and specialty meats products also contributed to increased net sales 

  

food ingredients net sales increased 170 million to 24 billion the increase in sales was primarily driven by the passthrough of increases in commodity raw material costs favorable results from commodity including energy merchandising and approximately 55 million related to the additional week in fiscal 2004 

  

due to the fresh beef and pork divestiture the meat processing segment includes no sales for fiscal 2004 net sales in fiscal 2003 were 25 billion 

  

gross profit 

net sales less cost of goods sold 

  

   

the company’s gross profit for fiscal 2004 was 32 billion a decrease of 162 million or 5 from the prior year the decrease reflects 168 million of gross profit in fiscal 2003 related to businesses the company no longer owns 34 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2004 to implement the company’s operational efficiency initiatives and higher input costs which were not fully offset by higher selling prices offset by an estimated 60 million of gross profit related to the additional week in fiscal 2004 

  

retail products gross profit for fiscal 2004 was 23 billion a decrease of 166 million from fiscal 2003 included in the prior year gross profit was 75 million from the divested canned seafood operations costs of implementing the company’s operational efficiency initiatives reduced gross profit by 20 million the estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in the current fiscal year was an increase in gross profit of approximately 42 million additionally the segment’s gross profit decreased due to a less favorable product mix increased input costs which were not fully offset by increased selling prices primarily in refrigerated meat products and an extremely competitive environment for popcorn products 

  

foodservice products gross profit for fiscal 2004 was 570 million an increase of 30 million over the prior fiscal year included in the prior year gross profit was 10 million from businesses divested in that year and a charge of approximately 24 million resulting from the reduction of the values of certain refrigerated foodservice meat inventory costs of implementing the company’s operational efficiency initiatives reduced gross profit by 13 million the estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in the current fiscal year was an increase of approximately 11 million 

  

the food ingredients segment generated gross profit of 348 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 57 million over the prior fiscal year the estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in the current fiscal year was an increase of approximately 7 million also favorably impacting fiscal 2004 gross profit was improved performance from certain valueadded food ingredient businesses which included a 22 million lowerofcost or market adjustment to inventory in fiscal 2003 and better results for commodity merchandising operations due to market volatility 

  

gross profit in the meat processing segment was 83 million in fiscal 2003 

  

   

the company’s gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2004 increased two percentage points as compared to fiscal 2003 which reflects the company’s divestitures of low margin operations and improvement in valueadded food ingredient products offset by the impact of higher input costs which were not fully offset by selling price increases principally in the retail products segment 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

selling general and administrative expenses includes general corporate expense “sga” 

  

sga expenses decreased 86 million or 4 to 18 billion for fiscal 2004 prior year sga expenses included approximately 10 million from divested businesses and 38 million of transaction costs related to the fresh beef and pork divestiture costs of implementing the company’s operational efficiency initiatives increased sga expenses by 27 million in fiscal 2004 the estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of approximately 34 million the results for fiscal 2004 include 25 million of litigation expense related to a former choline chloride joint venture with ei du pont nemours and co that was sold in 1997 in addition in fiscal 2004 the company established a 25 million reserve in connection with matters related to an sec investigation see “other” discussion within mda these items were partially offset by a gain of 21 million recognized upon the sale of the company’s costmethod investment in a venture lower selling costs marketingrelated costs and various other legal and insurance costs resulted in a favorable comparison with fiscal 2003 

  

operating profit 

earnings before general corporate expense interest expense income taxes and equity method investment earnings 

  

   

retail products operating profit decreased 80 million for the fiscal year to 12 billion included in prior year operating profit was 43 million from the divested canned seafood operations costs of implementing the company’s operational efficiency initiatives decreased operating profit by 25 million the estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of 28 million the remaining decline in operating profit is reflective of reduced gross profit due to increased input costs which were not fully offset by increased selling prices primarily in refrigerated meat products an extremely competitive environment in popcorn products and a less favorable mix of products 

  

foodservice products operating profit declined 24 million to 321 million included in fiscal 2003 operating profit was 6 million from businesses divested in that year costs of implementing the company’s operational efficiency initiatives decreased operating profit by 29 million the estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of 7 million increased gross profits were largely offset by significantly higher sga expenses related to information systems implementation costs 

  

food ingredients operating profit increased 72 million to 197 million primarily reflecting improved gross profits as discussed above costs of implementing the company’s operational efficiency initiatives decreased operating profit by 8 million the estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of 7 million 

  

the meat processing segment generated operating profit of 99 million in fiscal 2003 

  

interest expense net 

  

in fiscal 2004 net interest expense was 275 million unchanged from the prior fiscal year during fiscal 2004 the company closed out all 25 billion of its interest rate swap agreements of the 25 billion interest rate swaps closed out in fiscal 2004 20 billion of the interest rate swaps had been used to effectively convert certain of the company’s fixed rate debt into floating rate debt the remaining 500 million portion of the company’s interest rate swaps was used to hedge certain of the company’s forecasted interest payments on floating rate debt for the period from 2005 through 2011 for financial statement and tax purposes the proceeds received upon termination of the interest rate swap agreements will be recognized over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged the company’s net interest expense will continue to be favorably impacted by the interest rate swap agreements in fiscal 2005 but to a lesser extent than in fiscal 2004 due to the decreased effect of the interest rate swaps and lower interest income the company expects net interest expense to increase by approximately 40 million in fiscal 2005 

  

equity method investment earnings 

  

equity method investment earnings decreased to 44 million in fiscal 2004 from 46 million in fiscal 2003 this reflects decreased earnings from an investment in a south american joint venture offset by higher profits due to a full year of results of the company’s minority ownership in the fresh beef and pork joint venture established following the company’s fresh beef and pork divestiture in september 2002 income from the company’s other equity method investments which includes barley malting potato processing and grain merchandising did not substantially change from their fiscal 2003 amounts 

  

income loss from discontinued operations 

  

income from discontinued operations was 99 million net of tax in fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2003 the company recognized a netoftax loss from discontinued operations of 36 million the yearoveryear change primarily resulted from 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

•   a fiscal 2003 pretax charge of approximately 112 million related to lowering asset values in connection with the then pending chicken business sale

•   net pretax income of 51 million recognized on the sales of the chicken business uap north america and the spanish feed business in fiscal 2004

•   fiscal 2004 pretax impairment charges of 27 million recognized to writedown the longlived assets of the uap international and portuguese poultry operations to net realizable value and

•   significantly improved gross margins at the chicken business and uap north america during the sixmonth period of fiscal 2004 prior to the divestitures relative to those generated in fiscal 2003 due to industrywide improvements in the markets for their products

  

the company’s uap north america operations had a fiscal year end of february while the company’s consolidated year end is may historically the results of uap north america have been reflected in the company’s consolidated results on a threemonth “lag” eg uap north america’s results for june through august are included in the company’s consolidated results for the period september through november due to the disposition of uap north america on november 23 2003 uap north america’s results for the three months ending november 23 2003 a netoftax loss of approximately 238 million was recorded directly to retained earnings if this business had not been divested this netoftax loss would have been recognized in the company’s fiscal 2004 consolidated statement of earnings the comparable amount recorded in income loss from discontinued operations for the threemonth period ended november 24 2002 was a loss of 196 million 

  

income taxes and net income 

  

the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings was 37 for fiscal 2004 and 35 in fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2004 the company reached an agreement with the internal revenue service “irs” with respect to the irs’s examination of the company’s tax returns for fiscal years 1996 through 1999 as a result of the favorable resolution of these matters the company reduced income tax expense by 27 million this was partially offset by the net tax impact related to the divestiture of certain foreign entities which increased income tax expense by approximately 21 million during fiscal 2004 during fiscal 2003 the company divested its fresh beef and pork operations as a result the company generated foreign tax credits in excess of the taxable gain generated from the transaction this resulted in a decrease of approximately 4 in the company’s effective tax rate below the statutory tax rate in fiscal 2003 

  

  net income was 811 million or 153 per diluted share in fiscal 2004 compared to 764 million or 144 per diluted share in fiscal 2003

2003 vs 2002 

  

net sales 

  

   

overall company sales declined 54 billion or 24 to 169 billion primarily reflecting the impact of the fiscal 2003 fresh beef and pork divestiture fiscal 2002 sales included approximately 77 billion from the divested fresh beef and pork operations while fiscal 2003 sales included approximately 25 billion 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

retail products sales were 87 billion in fiscal 2003 a decline of 51 million or less than 1 for the year reflecting lower sales of branded processed meat products due to lower selling prices and the divestiture of the canned seafood operations these combined factors more than offset sales growth for several key retail brands 

  

net sales for the company’s retail consumer branded business showed a variety of results as sales of some of the company’s most significant brands including banquet healthy choice act ii orville redenbacher’s marie callender’s hebrew national pam and reddiwip grew major brands posting sales declines for the year included hunt’s armour chef boyardee and butterball new products and product extensions in the popcorn frozen meals and entrees whipped toppings shelfstable meals meat snacks and egg alternative categories positively impacted the retail products segment sales for the year as did themeoriented selling programs which focused on holiday summer grilling and sporting events the company continued to increase its investment in advertising and promotion to fuel profitable future sales growth the company believes the brand sales increases cited above reflected a number of factors including new product success product quality improvements and increased marketing spending in fiscal 2003 and previous periods while the brand sales declines cited above reflected a number of factors including an extremely competitive environment 

  

foodservice products net sales declined 181 million or 5 for fiscal 2003 to 36 million reflecting weaker results for french fries frozen seafood specialty meats and mexican foods this partly reflected soft conditions in the overall economy the company believes that soft economic conditions negatively impacted business travel as well as consumer spending at many types of restaurants in addition the foodservice products results also reflected competitive challenges facing some of the company’s major traditional quickservice restaurant customers which appeared to be losing customers to casual restaurants and other venues 

  

food ingredients net sales increased 99 million or 5 to 22 billion in fiscal 2003 sales within the segment are largely determined by input costs which can fluctuate significantly sales for basic ingredients which reflect gross profit for commodity merchandising increased reflecting improved margins for certain commodities such as grain as well as favorable results associated with the segment’s energy merchandising sales of milled ingredients—flour corn and oats increased overall reflecting higher selling prices resulting from higher input costs sales for the other specialty ingredients operations flavorings and seasonings were flat compared to fiscal 2002 

  

for fiscal 2003 net sales in the meat processing segment declined 68 to 25 billion as cited above the fresh beef and pork divestiture occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 accordingly in fiscal 2003 the segment results include only 115 days of activity as compared to a full fiscal year in the prior year net sales in fiscal 2003 for the fresh beef and pork business were below those of the prior year comparable period due to fluctuating market prices and difficult market conditions 

  

gross profit 

  

   

the company’s gross profit was 34 billion for fiscal 2003 compared to 36 billion in fiscal 2002 the decline is primarily reflective of the fresh beef and pork divestiture in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 

  

   

gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales improved to 20 from 16 in fiscal 2002 largely due to the fresh beef and pork divestiture as that business had comparatively low margins to a lesser degree the company’s manufacturing efficiency initiatives and improvement in product mix also boosted gross margins the retail products segment experienced increased sales of highmargin items such as snacks and frozen dinners and decreased sales for comparatively lowmargin items such as canned seafood and cheese also lower input costs for processed meats favorably impacted cost of goods sold and therefore gross margin 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

selling general and administrative expenses includes general corporate expense 

  

sga expenses decreased 63 million or 3 to 19 billion for fiscal 2003 fiscal 2002 sga expenses included approximately 100 million from the divested fresh beef and pork operations while fiscal 2003 sga expenses included approximately 33 million sga expenses were favorably impacted by 136 million due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets as the company was no longer required to amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 while 2003 sga expenses were reduced by the adoption of sfas no 142 and the fresh beef and pork divestiture these were partially offset by several sga expenses which increased in fiscal 2003 specifically during fiscal 2003 the company incurred incremental advertising and promotion approximately 56 million fresh beef and pork divestiture closing costs approximately 40 million and increased employmentrelated costs approximately 65 million the increased employmentrelated costs primarily relate to increased pension and postretirement costs resulting from the company reducing the discount rate used to measure the present value of its obligations as well as reducing the assumed rate of return on plan assets sga expenses were 11 of sales during fiscal 2003 as compared to 9 of sales during fiscal 2002 this 2 increase was primarily a result of the fresh beef and pork divestiture reducing net sales without a proportionate reduction in sga expenses as sga expenses in the fresh beef and pork businesses were historically a low percentage of net sales 

  

operating profit 

earnings before general corporate expense goodwill amortization interest expense income taxes and equity method investment earnings 

  

   

retail products operating profit grew 72 million or 6 for fiscal 2003 to reach 13 billion reflecting successful cost management initiatives and improved product mix cost management initiatives include project nucleus as well as supply chain procurement manufacturing shipping and warehousing and selling and administrative expenses included in the supply chain initiative the retail products segment is an sku stock keeping unit reduction program designed to discontinue the manufacture of certain unprofitable or marginally profitable items in order to boost overall efficiency and margins profit growth efforts included overall brandbuilding programs to better connect with consumers and improve consumer appreciation of the company’s products profit improvement initiatives also included focusing on the company’s highermargin items as part of a plan to improve product mix 

  

while margins for many major retailoriented products grew including shelfstable grocery and refrigerated prepared foods the most significant segment profit improvement occurred in the company’s frozen foods business in that business the company believes that improved product quality and effective expense control contributed significantly to the profit improvement 

  

overall operating profit for the foodservice products segment declined 19 million to 345 million for fiscal 2003 reflecting a continuing difficult environment believed by the company to be the result of a weak economy and factors negatively affecting certain major quickservice restaurant customers in addition the company reduced the values of certain refrigerated foodservice meat inventory items during the year which resulted in a pretax charge of approximately 24 million 

  

food ingredients operating profit declined 64 million or 34 to 125 million while profits for the basic ingredients businesses grew due primarily to more favorable results in the company’s energy merchandising operations profits for milled ingredients declined due to increased input costs and profits for specialty ingredients declined due in part to increased competition in the garlic market during fiscal 2003 the company also reduced the value of certain garlic inventory by 22 million as lowercost chinese garlic created competitive pressure 

  

meat processing operating profit decreased 47 to 99 million due to the fresh beef and pork divestiture during the year which removed those operating profits from the segment’s earnings base in addition the company settled an insurance claim relating to a beef plant fire that occurred in 2001 and realized approximately 50 million of segment operating profit the insurance proceeds represented a recovery for the loss of facilities inventory and related items 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

interest expense net 

  

for fiscal 2003 net interest expense was 275 million 30 below fiscal 2002 amounts primarily due to lower interest rates increased interest income and reduced outstanding debt amounts through the use of interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixedrate debt to floatingrate debt the company benefited from lower interest rates as compared to fiscal 2002 the increased interest income resulted from the company holding debt securities issued by the fresh beef and pork joint venture in which the company holds a minority interest also contributing to the reduced fiscal 2003 interest expense was the company’s reduction of 222 million of debt with cash proceeds generated by divestitures completed during the year 

  

equity method investment earnings 

  

equity method investment earnings increased to 46 million in fiscal 2003 from 34 million in fiscal 2002 the increase was primarily due to the company’s minority ownership in the fresh beef and pork joint venture established following the company’s fresh beef and pork divestiture during fiscal 2003 income from the company’s other equity method investments which include barley malting potato production and grain merchandising did not substantially change from fiscal 2002 amounts 

  

income loss from discontinued operations 

  

in fiscal 2003 the company recognized a net of tax loss from discontinued operations of 36 million versus income from discontinued operations of 23 million in fiscal 2002 the yearoveryear decline reflects a fiscal 2003 pretax charge of approximately 112 million 69 million aftertax related to lowering asset values in connection with the pending chicken business sale fiscal 2003 was also negatively impacted by a weaker performance from the chicken business for most of fiscal 2003 the chicken markets were very difficult and fresh chicken prices remained low the company believes those prices were partly due to large supplies of chicken and other proteins a situation made worse by weak exports of chicken to russia due to that country’s policy changes regarding imports this weakness in the chicken business was partially offset by significantly improved results at uap north america due to better customer and product mix lower bad debt expense and reduced administrative and other operating costs as a result of cost management initiatives 

  

income taxes and net income 

  

the effective tax rate calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pretax income from continuing operations inclusive of equity method investment earnings of 35 for fiscal 2003 was below the 39 effective rate in fiscal 2002 due in part to the cessation of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of the adoption of sfas no 142 also during fiscal 2003 the company divested its fresh beef and pork operations as a result the company generated foreign tax credits in excess of the taxable gain generated from the transaction this resulted in a decrease of approximately 4 in the company’s effective tax rate below the statutory tax rate in fiscal 2003 net income was 764 million or 144 per diluted share compared to 772 million or 145 per diluted share in fiscal 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sources of liquidity and capital 

  

the company’s primary financing objective is to maintain a conservative balance sheet that provides the flexibility to pursue its growth objectives the company has historically used shortterm debt and its accounts receivable securitization program to finance increases in its trade working capital accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable accrued expenses and advances on sales needs and a combination of equity and longterm debt to finance both its base trade working capital needs and its noncurrent assets 

  

commercial paper borrowings usually less than 30 days maturity are reflected in the company’s consolidated balance sheets within notes payable the company maintains backup bank lines of credit at least equal to outstanding commercial paper borrowings the company has never used these backup lines of credit the company is in compliance with the credit agreements’ financial covenants management believes the company will maintain its current debt credit rating for the foreseeable future thus allowing the company’s continued issuance of commercial paper if the company were unable to access the shortterm commercial paper market the company would use its bank revolving credit facility to provide liquidity 

  

the company has in place a 105 billion revolving credit facility expiring in may 2007 with major domestic and international banks the interest rates for the revolving credit facilities are generally 30 to 35 percentage points higher than the interest rates for commercial paper the company had availability of 400 million under its accounts receivable securitization program at fiscal year end 2004 under this program accounts receivable are sold without recourse at a discount and this cost is included in selling general and administrative expenses because these accounts receivable are sold without recourse to unrelated third parties accounts receivable balances sold are excluded from the company’s consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2004 the company had no outstanding accounts receivable sold while accounts receivable sold totaled 556 million including amounts from discontinued operations as of the end of fiscal 2003 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

the company’s overall level of interestbearing debt totaled 57 billion at the end of fiscal 2004 compared to 59 billion as of the end of fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2004 the company repaid 515 million of debt this was largely offset by the increase in longterm debt resulting from the company’s adoption of fasb interpretation “fin” no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities which required the consolidation of certain variable interest entities from which the company leases buildings and transportation equipment this also required the deconsolidation of conagra capital lc an indirectly controlled subsidiary of the company which had previously issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and entered into loan agreements with the company having similar terms as the preferred securities the adoption of fin no 46r resulted in the addition of 419 million of longterm debt and 25 million of minority interest and the reduction of 175 million of preferred securities of subsidiary company to the company’s balance sheet as of the end of both fiscal 2004 and 2003 the company’s senior debt ratings were bbb fitch baa1 moody’s and bbb standard  poor’s all investment grade ratings 

  

the company also has a shelf registration under which it could issue from time to time up to 4 billion in debt securities 

  

over the last two fiscal years the company has divested its major commodity operations such as fresh beef and pork cheese processing canned seafood chicken processing and agricultural chemical distribution the company received debt and equity interests as part of the proceeds for certain of those businesses the company expects to sell or otherwise monetize those items in the future subject to contractual conditions as of fiscal year end 2004 the company has the following investments and other interests related to these transactions 

  

•   approximately 315 million of net assets of the cattle feeding venture

  

•   approximately 150 million of subordinated notes receivable plus accrued interest from the fresh beef and pork venture

  

•   approximately 197 million of equity interest in the fresh beef and pork venture

  

•   approximately 34 million of uap preferred securities and

  

•   approximately 254 million shares of pilgrim’s pride corporation valued at 246 million at the time of the transaction with a total carrying value of 392 million at the end of fiscal 2004

  

the pilgrim’s pride corporation shares are contractually restricted such that the company cannot sell any portion of the shares for one year from the date of the chicken business divestiture and can sell no more than 847 million shares in any twelvemonth period unless such restrictions are waived by pilgrim’s pride as of fiscal year end 2004 847 million shares are classified as “available for sale” as these shares may be sold by the company within twelve months the availableforsale shares are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices with unrealized gains of 146 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the remaining 1693 million shares are accounted for at cost 

  

cash flows 

  

in fiscal 2004 the company used 79 million of cash which was the net impact of 581 million generated from operating activities 684 million generated from investing activities and 13 billion used in financing activities 

  

cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled 708 million for fiscal 2004 as compared to 966 million generated in fiscal 2003 the decreased cash flow was primarily due to a decrease of 470 million in amounts sold under the accounts receivable securitization program partially offset by the fiscal 2003 contributions to the company’s pension plans of 233 million cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was approximately 127 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to 291 million in fiscal 2003 cash flow from operating activities is one of the company’s primary sources of liquidity 

  

cash generated from investing activities totaled 684 million for fiscal 2004 versus cash generated from investing activities of 558 million in fiscal 2003 investing activities for fiscal 2004 consisted primarily of proceeds of approximately 935 million from the divestitures of the chicken business uap north america and the spanish feed business partially offset by capital expenditures of 352 million 

  

cash used in financing activities totaled 13 billion in fiscal 2004 as compared to cash used of 703 million in fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2004 the company repaid debt of 515 million paid dividends of 537 million and repurchased 153 million shares of its outstanding common stock for 419 million during fiscal 2003 the company repaid debt of 222 million and paid dividends of 509 million 

  

the company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal 2005 will be approximately 475 million reflecting increased investment in information systems and the logistics network management believes that existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital needs planned capital expenditures additional share repurchases and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

the company uses offbalance sheet arrangements eg operating leases where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use the company periodically enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business these are described further in “obligations and commitments” below 

  

the company has used offbalance sheet arrangements in connection with the securitization and sale of trade receivables generated in the ordinary course of business as of may 30 2004 the company had agreements to sell interests in pools of receivables in an amount not to exceed 400 million at any one time as of the end of fiscal 2004 the company had no outstanding accounts receivable sold whereas accounts receivable sold totaled 556 million as of the end of fiscal 2003 

  

as a result of adopting fin no 46r the company has consolidated the assets and liabilities of several entities from which it leases property plant and equipment the company has also deconsolidated conagra capital lc an indirectly controlled subsidiary of the company due to the adoption of fin no 46r the company recorded an increase to property plant and equipment of 221 million an increase to longterm debt of 419 million an increase to other assets of 46 million an increase to other noncurrent liabilities of 25 million and a decrease in preferred securities of subsidiary company of 175 million the company has no other material obligations arising out of variable interests with unconsolidated entities 

  

obligations and commitments 

  

as part of its ongoing operations the company enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements debt agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices such as “takeorpay” contracts the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into by the company in its normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available to the company of these items capital lease and debt obligations which total 57 billion are currently recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations which total 884 million are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles payments in excess of debt service requirements to be made to variable interest entities which have been consolidated under the requirements of fin no 46r are included in operating lease obligations 

  

a summary of the company’s contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2004 is as follows including obligations of discontinued operations 

  

  

   

the company’s total obligations of approximately 66 billion reflect a decrease of approximately 439 million from the company’s 2003 fiscal year end the decrease was primarily a result of the repayment of certain longterm debt during fiscal 2004 partially offset by the addition of 419 million of debt associated with the adoption of fin no 46r 

  

as part of its ongoing operations the company also enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event eg guarantee debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet a summary of the company’s commitments including commitments associated with equity method investments as of the end of fiscal 2004 is as follows including obligations of discontinued operations

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

the contract stipulates minimum price commitments based in part on market prices and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs 

  

trading activities 

  

the company accounts for certain contracts eg “physical” commodity purchasesale contracts and derivative contracts at fair value the company considers a portion of these contracts to be its “trading” activities specifically those contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and its related amendment sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities collectively “sfas no 133” the table below summarizes the changes in trading assets and liabilities for fiscal 2004 

  

   

1   includes contracts outstanding at may 25 2003 and contracts entered into and settled during fiscal 2004

2   includes option premiums paid and received

  

the following table represents the fair value and scheduled maturity dates of contracts outstanding as of may 30 2004 

  

   

in order to minimize the risk of loss associated with nonexchangetraded transactions with counterparties the company utilizes established credit limits and performs ongoing counterparty credit evaluations 

  

the above tables exclude commoditybased contracts entered into in the normal course of business including “physical” contracts to buy or sell commodities at agreedupon fixed prices as well as derivative contracts eg futures and options used primarily to hedge an existing asset or liability eg inventory or an anticipated transaction eg purchase of inventory the use of such contracts is not considered by the company to be “trading” activities as these contracts are considered either normal purchase and sale contracts or hedging contracts 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management the estimates used by management are based on the company’s historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances certain of the company’s accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management of the company 

  

the company’s audit committee has reviewed the development selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates 

  

marketing costs— the company incurs certain costs to promote its products through marketing programs which include advertising retailer incentives and consumer incentives the company expenses each of these types of marketing costs in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting literature the judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant for volumebased incentives provided to retailers management must continually assess the likelihood of the retailer achieving the specified targets similarly for consumer coupons management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on the company’s historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends as these factors change management’s estimates could change and the company could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

income taxes— the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes the company recognizes current tax liabilities and assets based on an estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current year for each of the jurisdictions in which the company transacts business as part of the determination of its current tax liability management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating positions taken by the company in its tax returns the company has established reserves for probable tax exposures these reserves included in current tax liabilities represent the company’s estimate of amounts expected to be paid which the company adjusts over time as more information regarding tax audits becomes available

  

the company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences eg book depreciation versus tax depreciation if appropriate the company recognizes valuation allowances to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized based on the company’s assessment of future taxable income including the consideration of available tax planning strategies 

  

the calculation of current and deferred tax assets including valuation allowances and liabilities requires management to apply significant judgment related to the application of complex tax laws changes in tax laws or related interpretations uncertainties related to the outcomes of tax audits and changes in the company’s operations or other facts and circumstances further management must continually monitor changes in these factors changes in such factors may result in changes to management estimates and could require the company to adjust its tax assets and liabilities and record additional income tax expense or benefits 

  

environmental liabilities— environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated management works with independent thirdparty specialists in order to effectively assess the company’s environmental liabilities management estimates the company’s environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies extent of required cleanup the known volumetric contribution of the company and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup management’s estimate as to its potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims the company does not discount its environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above management’s estimate of environmental liabilities may also change

  

employmentrelated benefits— the company incurs certain employmentrelated expenses associated with pensions postretirement health care benefits and workers’ compensation in order to measure the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to the company the estimates used by management are based on the company’s historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances the company uses thirdparty specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employmentrelated benefits different estimates used by management could result in the company recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time

  

impairment of longlived assets including property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets— in accordance with applicable accounting literature the company reduces the carrying amounts of longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts ie assets are deemed to be impaired fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular assets being tested for impairment as well as select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows when determining future cash flow estimates the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company in such areas as future economic conditions industryspecific conditions product pricing and necessary capital expenditures the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for longlived assets goodwill and identifiable intangible assets

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

related party transactions 

  

conagra foods enters into many lease agreements for land buildings and equipment at competitive market rates and some of the lease arrangements are with opus corporation or its affiliates a director of conagra foods is a beneficial owner officer and director of opus corporation the agreements relate to the leasing of land and buildings for conagra foods conagra foods occupies the buildings pursuant to longterm leases with opus corporation and its affiliates some of which contain various termination rights and purchase options leases effective in fiscal 2004 required annual lease payments by conagra foods of 21 million as a result of adopting fin no 46r the company has consolidated certain of the opus affiliates from which it leases property plant and equipment these leases were previously accounted for as operating leases opus corporation or its affiliates were paid 41 million for construction work during fiscal 2004 on properties leased by conagra foods from third parties opus corporation had revenues in excess of 1 billion in 2003

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

market risk 

  

the principal market risks affecting the company are exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs interest rates and foreign currencies these fluctuations impact raw material costs of all reporting segments as well as the company’s trading activities 

  

commodities— the company purchases commodity inputs such as wheat corn oats soybean meal soybean oil meat dairy products sugar energy and packaging materials to be used in its operations these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create gross margin risk the company enters into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments conagra foods has policies governing the hedging instrument its businesses may use these policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of its businesses the company also monitors the amount of associated counterparty credit risk for all nonexchangetraded transactions in addition the company purchases and sells certain commodities such as wheat corn soybeans soybean meal soybean oil oats and energy in its trading operations the company’s trading activities are limited in terms of maximum dollar exposure as measured by a dollaratrisk methodology and monitored to ensure compliance

  

the following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes in practice as markets move the company actively manages its risk and adjusts hedging strategies as appropriate fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on the company’s net derivative position by commodity at each quarterend during the fiscal year the market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying commodity positions that are being hedged the commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative commodity instrument 

  

effect of 10 change in market prices 

  

   

  interest rates— the company primarily uses interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on a portion of its existing debt and forecasted debt balances the company enters into such interest rate swaps to take advantage of historically low shortterm rates while continuing to maintain longterm financing as of may 25 2003 the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements recognized in prepaid 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis continued 

  

expenses and other current assets was approximately 220 million while the fair value of interest rate swap agreements recognized in other accrued liabilities was approximately 52 million all of the company’s interest rate swaps were liquidated in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

as of may 30 2004 and may 25 2003 the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt was estimated at 62 billion and 63 billion respectively based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors as of may 30 2004 and may 25 2003 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 336 million and 428 million respectively while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt by approximately 387 million and 490 million respectively with respect to floating rate debt a one percentage point change in interest rates would have impacted net interest expense by approximately 1 million and 11 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

foreign operations— in order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of its processing and trading operations this activity primarily relates to hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory capital equipment sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities

  

the following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis for the company’s processing and trading operations sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in exchange rates actual changes in exchange rates may differ from hypothetical changes fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates and was based on the company’s net foreign currency position at each quarterend during the fiscal year the market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying foreign denominated transactions that are being hedged the currencies hedged have a high inverse correlation to exchange rate changes of the foreign currency derivative instrument

general 

  

the following comments pertain to each of the company’s reporting segments 

  

conagra foods is a food company that operates in many different areas of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded and valueadded consumer products conagra foods uses many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities the prices paid for raw materials used in the products of conagra foods generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental 

  

  

agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors the company believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources the company uses hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials however it does not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not fully protect the company or its subsidiaries from increases in specific raw material costs

  

the company experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets the company’s products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private label and customized products the company has major competitors in each of its reporting segments 

  

quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition the company conducts research activities related to the development of new products 

  

many of conagra foods’ facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products sanitation safety and environmental control the company believes that it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or the competitive position of the company 

  

at may 30 2004 conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 39000 employees primarily in the united states 

  

d foreign operations 

  

foreign operations information is set forth in note 19 “business segments and related information” on pages 88 through 90 of the company’s 2004 annual report to stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference

  

e available information   the company makes available free of charge through its internet website at httpwwwconagrafoodscom its annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission 

  

risk factors 

  

the following factors could affect the company’s operating results and should be considered in evaluating the company 

  

the company must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

  

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of the company’s food products depends on the company’s ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences the company introduces new products and improved products in all of its business segments from time to time and incurs significant development and marketing costs if the company’s products fail to meet consumer preference then the company’s strategy to grow sales and profits with new products will be less successful 

  

if the company does not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry its profitability could decrease 

  

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and be efficient 

  

  

in the highly competitive food industry the company is currently implementing profitenhancing initiatives that impact its marketing sales operations and information systems functions these initiatives include elimination of duplicative costs and overhead consolidation of selected plants and support functions efforts to streamline and improve the company’s ability to do business with its customers distributors and brokers and realignment of business organizations if the company does not continue to manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies its competitiveness and its profitability could decrease

  

increased competition may result in reduced sales for the company 

  

the food industry is highly competitive and increased competition can reduce sales for the company 

  

the consolidation of the company’s retail customers has resulted in large sophisticated customers with increased buying power 

  

the company’s retail customers such as supermarkets and warehouse clubs have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for company products for their private label products if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength or less shelf space for company products the company’s profitability could decline 

  

the company may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact its profitability 

  

the company sells food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering and other adulteration of food products the company may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of its products causes injury illness or death in addition the company will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage in the past the company has issued recalls and has from time to time been involved in lawsuits relating to its food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact the company’s profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competitive reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that company products caused illness or injury could adversely affect the company’s reputation with existing and potential customers and its corporate and brand image 

  

commodity price increases will increase operating costs and may reduce profits 

  

the company uses many different commodities including wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs the company may not be able to increase its product prices to offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability the company has many years’ experience in hedging against commodity price increases however hedging practices reduce but do not eliminate the risk of increased operating costs from commodity price increases for example higher commodity prices in fiscal 2004 which were not fully offset by higher selling prices negatively affected the company’s operating profit 

  

if the company fails to comply with the many laws applicable to its business it may incur significant fines and penalties 

  

the company’s facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the company’s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties and injunctive relief civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of its products the company’s operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and 

  

  

disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity

general 

  

the following comments pertain to each of the company’s reporting segments 

  

conagra foods is a food company that operates in many different areas of the food industry with a significant focus on the sale of branded and valueadded consumer products conagra foods uses many different raw materials the bulk of which are commodities raw materials are generally available from several different sources and conagra foods presently believes that it can obtain these as needed 

  

the company experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets the company’s products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private label and customized products the company has major competitors in all of its reporting segments 

  

quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control in addition the company conducts research activities related to the development of new products 

  

many of conagra foods’ facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products sanitation safety and environmental control the company believes that it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or the competitive position of the company 

  

at may 25 2003 conagra foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 63000 employees primarily in the united states 

  

d foreign operations 

  

foreign operations information is set forth in note 21 “business segments and related information” on pages 68 through 70 of the company’s 2003 annual report to stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference 

  

risk factors 

  

the following factors could affect the company’s operating results and should be considered in evaluating the company 

  

the company must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences 

  

consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of the company’s food products depends on the company’s ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences the company introduces new products and improved products in all of its business segments from time to time and incurs significant development and marketing cost for example the company believes weaker sales results for the company’s foodservice products in fiscal 2003 reflected changing consumer preferences resulting from business travel and consumer spending at certain types of restaurants being negatively impacted by softer economic conditions if the company’s products fail to meet consumer preference then the company’s strategy to grow sales and profits with 

 

new products will be less successful 

  

if the company does not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry its profitability could decrease 

  

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and be efficient in the highly competitive food industry the company has in recent years eliminated excess costs and achieved additional efficiencies by aligning sales marketing and manufacturing functions if the company does not continue to manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies its competitiveness and its profitability could decrease 

  

increased competition may result in reduced sales for the company 

  

the food industry is highly competitive and increased competition reduces sales for the company for example sales of seasonings blends and flavorings declined in fiscal 2003 as a result of poor performance for the company’s garlic operations due to lost volume related to increased competition from chinese garlic producers 

  

the consolidation of the company’s retail customers has resulted in large sophisticated customers with increased buying power 

  

the company’s retail customers such as supermarkets and warehouse clubs have consolidated in recent years these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating with reduced inventories these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space currently used for company products for their private label products if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength or less shelf space for company products the company’s profitability will decline 

  

the company may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact its profitability 

  

the company sells food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering and other adulteration of food products the company may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of its products causes injury illness or death in addition the company will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage in the past the company has issued recalls and has from time to time been involved in lawsuits relating to its food products a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact the company’s profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competitive reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that company products caused illness or injury could adversely affect the company’s reputation with existing and potential customers and its corporate and brand image 

  

for the agricultural products segment downturns in the agricultural industry reduce product demand create a difficult product pricing environment and make credit collection more difficult 

  

the agricultural industry is cyclical and subject to a variety of economic governmental and weather related conditions weather patterns livestock and crop diseases uncertainty over farm policy and other farming related factors have caused downturns in the agricultural industry in recent years factors that negatively affect the agricultural industry reduce farm income which results in less demand for agricultural products and a less favorable product pricing environment and negatively affects the ability of customers to pay for products purchased on credit these factors negatively affected the fiscal 2002 operating results for the company when the agricultural products segment represented approximately 13 of the company’s total sales but less than 1 of the company’s total operating profit 

  

commodity price increases will increase operating costs and may reduce profits 

  

the company uses many different commodities including wheat corn oats soybeans beef pork poultry and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price increases will result in 

  

 

increases in raw material costs and operating costs the company may not be able to increase its product prices to offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability the company has many years’ experience in hedging against commodity price increases however hedging practices reduce but do not eliminate the risk of increased operating costs from commodity price increases for example higher commodity prices in fiscal 2002 and significant energy price increases such as were experienced in fiscal 2001 have impacted the company’s results 

  

if the company fails to comply with the many laws applicable to its business it may incur significant fines and penalties 

  

the company’s facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the company’s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties and injunctive relief civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of its products the company’s operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity 

  

the company incurs significant costs in complying with laws and regulations 

  

the company incurs significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with laws and regulations for example the company’s financial statement footnote on “contingencies” describes continuing costs for compliance with environmental laws future material changes in these laws and regulations could increase the company’s operating costs various governments throughout the world are considering regulatory proposals relating to genetically modified organisms or ingredients food safety and market regulation which if adopted will increase the company’s operating costs if any of these or other proposals are enacted the company may not be able to pass on these cost increases to customers without experiencing volume and profit losses
