 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion stores—ross dress for less ® “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  

ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1628 locations in 40 states the district of columbia and guam as of january 29 2022 ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices every day ross’ target customers are primarily from middle income households 

we also operate 295 dd’s discounts stores in 21 states as of january 29 2022 dd’s discounts features more moderatelypriced firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood and its target customers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than ross customers 

the merchant store field and distribution operations for ross and dd’s discounts are separate the two chains share certain corporate and support services 

both our ross and dd’s discounts brands target valueconscious customers the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are based on these customer profiles we believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

• maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store 

• meet customer needs on a local basis 

• deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer 

• manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 29 2022 january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 as fiscal 2021 fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively each of which were 52week years 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brand name and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices every day at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is on trend and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising which emphasizes a strong value message our stores offer a treasurehunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item our merchandise offerings include but are not limited to apparel including footwear and accessories small furniture home accents bed and bath beauty toys luggage gourmet food cookware jewelry and watches 

purchasing we have a large network of merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers despite the ongoing supply chain congestion we have been able to suf ficiently source merchandise inventory 

we believe our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders delivery is made to one of our distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on purchases 

the merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer and brand overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season “closeout” purchases and production direct from brands and factories “upfront” purchases we also source merchandise under inhouse brands or vendor brands merchandise can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at great values or can be stored as packaway merchandise 

packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months 

in fiscal 2021 we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 40 and 38 of total inventories as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 respectively we believe the strong discounts we offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

our primary buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nation’s two largest apparel markets we also operate a smaller buying office located in boston these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market frequently sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers thes e locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

at the end of fiscal 2021 we had over 900 merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct and each includes merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have on average seven years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in our merchant organization to further develop our relationships with our manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing we sell brand name merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brand name merchandise that is priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing is reflected on most of our price tags which display our selling price as well as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

as of january 29 2022 we operated a total of 1923 stores comprised of 1628 ross stores and 295 dd’s discounts stores our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit we cluster ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management we do the same for dd’s discounts stores 

we believe a key element of our success at both ross and dd’s discounts is our organized attractive and easytoshop instore environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasurehunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers our stores have shopping carts andor baskets available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing in response to the health pandemic from the novel coronavirus covid19 we have implemented enhanced safety protocols for our customers and associates 

we accept a variety of payment methods we provide refunds or store credit on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to do this are labor costs that are generally lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

in response to covid19 we implemented additional processes and procedures to facilitate social distancing to enhance cleaning and sanitation activities and to provide personal protective equipment to our associates which has increased our operating costs we have incurred and expect to continue to incur elevated operating costs during the covid19 pandemic 

information systems 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years current initiatives include continued enhancements to our stores distribution merchandising merchandise planning and cybersecurity systems these initiatives support future growth the execution and achievement of our plans ongoing stability and compliance 

distribution 

we operate distribution processing facilities where we receive and ship all of our merchandise to our stores these distribution centers are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model we also operate warehouse facilities for packaway storage 

we utilize a combination of our own and thirdparty cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our distribution centers and warehouses with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing and storage capacity to support our current store growth information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

advertising 

advertising for ross dress for less relies on a mix of television and digital channels to communicate the ross value proposition—savings off the same brands carried at leading department or specialty stores every day this strategy reflects our belief that a mix of channels is necessary to reach our customer within digital channels we continue to grow social digital video and audio to communicate our brand position advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on radio both broadcast and digital social media and new store grand openings 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross ®  ross dress for less ®  and dd’s discounts ® have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

human capital 

as of january 29 2022 we had approximately 100000 total associates which includes both full and parttime associates additionally we hire temporary associates especially during peak seasons we have no associates that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement management considers the relationship between the company and our associates to be good 

our associates play essential roles in delivering great value to our customers throughout our organization we recognize and appreciate the importance of attracting retaining and developing our associates and we have a number of key programs to do so 

talent development the professional growth of our associates is important to our success as a business we identify and enumerate key competencies we believe are critical to our ability to execute our business model and deliver the values our customers expect we utilize these competencies in the hiring development evaluation and future planning of our teams we provide training opportunities to help associates grow and build their careers our associates managers and executives may participate in technical and leadership development activities we support associates interested in leadership roles by offering opportunities to gain experience and build the skills necessary to advance within the company we are proud that many store leaders started their careers with us as retail associates 

diversity equality and inclusion we care about our associates and the communities we serve we are committed to building diverse teams and an inclusive culture that respects values and celebrates the diversity of backgrounds identities and ideas of those who work and shop with us we are focused on executing strategies to support our commitment to diversity equality and inclusion 

community and social impact we provide our associates the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social impact through various programs such as our matching gift program volunteer time off for eligible associates and a scholarship program for our associates and their dependents 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customers and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization we also continue to make improvements to our merchandising systems to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product to our stores we operate in an attractive sector of retail that we anticipate will be facing reduced brick and mortar competition given the significant number of recent retail closures and bankruptcies we believe that we remain wellpositioned within the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry to compete based on these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from online retailers department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2021 and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain forwardlooking statements with respect to anticipated future events including the rapidly developing challenges and our plans and responses from the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions our future financial performance operations competitive position and our projected growth that are all subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and from our prior expectations and projections refer to management’s discussion and analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of “forwardlooking statements” 

our financial condition results of operations cash flows and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors risks and uncertainties that apply to both ross and dd’s discounts include without limitation the following 

the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our sales and our operations and we expect it to continue to have adverse effects on our business and our financial performance 

the united states and other countries continue to experience a prolonged major global covid19 pandemic including additional outbreaks driven by new virus variants with related significant disruptions and impacts to retail operations and supply chains and to general economic activities the situation continues to be unprecedented and rapidly changing and has unknown duration and severity 

as the covid19 pandemic continues our customers and associates may be affected by future recommendations andor mandates from federal state and local authorities to stay home to avoid nonessential social contact and gatherings of people and to selfquarantine while a significant and increasing portion of the population is vaccinated or may have acquired some level of immunity after recovering from illness it will take more time for those factors to reach levels that permit a return to prepandemic levels of social activity additional outbreaks and spreading of the disease have been occurring across the united states and levels of spread have gone up and down in different regions government authorities in affected regions have in the past taken actions sometimes 

drastic and including mandatory capacity restrictions reduced operating hours and closure of retail operations in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease we may still face required store closures and distribution center closures nationally regionally or in specific locations 

we have a concentration of store locations in the states of california texas and florida together those states include almost fifty percent of our stores more than half of our distribution centers and warehouses are located in california a severe outbreak or a required closure affecting these facilities would be very disruptive to our ability to supply merchandise to our stores the covid19 pandemic may potentially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff our distribution centers our stores and our merchant and other support operations further the covid19 pandemic has impacted multiple countries leading to supply related disruptions including port of exitentry congestion shipping delays and ocean freight cost increases which may also adversely affect our ability to access and ship products from affected regions 

the prolonged widespread pandemic has adversely impacted global economies which has resulted in an economic downturn an economic rebound is resulting in rising inflation that may reduce consumer demand for our products and also increase our costs the extent and duration of the impact from the covid19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments including the duration and spread of outbreaks within the us regional surges in infection vaccination rates potential acquired immunity the effectiveness of vaccines in controlling current and future variants of the virus the response by all levels of government in their efforts to contain the outbreak and to mitigate the resulting economic disruptions and the related impact on consumer confidence shopping behavior and spending all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted such impacts have and are expected to adversely affect our profitability cash flows financial results and our capital resources 

we are subject to impacts from the macroeconomic environment financial and credit markets and geopolitical conditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income the covid19 pandemic and accompanying economic impacts including supply chain disruptions and inflation and the developing russiaukraine conflict and accompanying economic impacts may have prolonged and significant negative effects on consumer confidence shopping behavior and spending which may adversely affect our sales and gross margins 

consumer spending habits for the merchandise we sell are affected by many factors currently the repercussions from the ongoing covid19 pandemic present significant risks and uncertainty there is significant uncertainty over potential changes in consumer behavior and shopping patterns as the pandemic continues and as different regions experience surges 

currently there is also a rapidly developing russiaukraine conflict which has already escalated into a significant military confrontation and is resulting in major potentially prolonged economic sanctions and other responses from the united states and other countries which present significant risks and uncertainties these events may cause various adverse macroeconomic effects including increases in fuel and energy prices and depressed financial markets 

other factors include levels of unemployment the size and timing of federal stimulus programs salaries and wage rates prevailing economic conditions increasing inflation rising interest rates recession and fears of recession housing costs energy and fuel costs income tax rates and the timing of tax refunds consumer perceptions of personal wellbeing and security availability of consumer credit consumer debt levels and the resulting effects on consumers’ disposable income and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 

the covid19 pandemic the russiaukraine conflict and other potential adverse developments in any of these areas could reduce demand for our merchandise increase our cost of goods freight cost and payroll costs decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins all of our stores are located in the united states and its territories so we are especially susceptible to changes in the us economy   

we need to successfully operate under the health and safety measures implemented in our stores and distribution centers and across all our operations to comply with regulatory requirements and with the goal of keeping our customers and associates safe from the spread of the covid19 virus without disruptions to our operations 

we have implemented a variety of measures in our store locations distribution centers and other facilities with the goal of keeping our associates customers and the communities we serve safe from spreading the covid19 virus these measures include additional cleaning and sanitation of stores and workspaces providing associates with personal protective equipment based on cdc or other federal state or local health guidelines and implementing physical distancing practices in our stores distribution centers and in our other operations this is very challenging to do and there is significant risk incremental costs and uncertainty regarding changing requirements not only are these measures evolving but they often require change to established habits and patterns of behavior by large groups of people who may not fully understand or agree with the requested changes whatever measures we adopt there will also be challenges in effecting consistent compliance by our customers and our associates we are adapting and changing these measures as we learn from experience and despite our efforts and best intentions incidents of infection will occur at our stores distribution centers andor in our other facilities potentially resulting in serious illness for those affected including our associates this may result in required temporary closure of specific stores distribution centers or other facilities and in temporary or longer term loss of key personnel during illness and potential supply chain disruptions we may also face claims with or without merit that our retail stores or our other facilities and workplaces are operating in an unsafe manner or are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations any such incidents may adversely affect our operating results increase our costs and damage our reputation and competitive position 

competitive pressures in the apparel and homerelated merchandise retailing industry are high 

the retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store and online formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector we compete for customers associates store locations and merchandise with many other local regional and national retailers traditional department stores upscale mass merchandisers other offprice retailers specialty stores internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing business strategies and promotional activity particularly during holiday periods in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition the substantial sales growth in ecommerce within the last decade has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors new business models and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online shopping alternatives intense pressures from our competitors our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape or a failure to effectively execute our offprice model could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause us to take greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins 

unexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and homerelated merchandise could adversely affect us 

our success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand we work on an ongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer needs it is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the multiple markets in which we operate throughout the united states and its territories although our offprice business model provides us certain advantages and may allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers have in adjusting our merchandise mix to everchanging consumer tastes our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer trends and preferences particularly in our newer geographic markets failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends preferences and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

adverse andor unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and other merchandise and may result in temporary store closures and disruptions in deliveries of merchandise to our stores 

unseasonable weather and prolonged extreme temperatures as well as events such as storms affect consumers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop and may adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise among other things weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or require us to close certain stores temporarily thereby reducing store traffic even if stores are not closed many customers may be unable to go or may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather as a result adverse or unseasonable weather in any of our markets could lead to disappointing sales and cause us to increase our markdowns which may negatively affect our sales and margins 

in order to achieve our planned gross margins we must effectively manage our inventories markdowns and inventory shortage as a result of changes in shopping behaviors due to the covid19 pandemic disruptions to supply chains and store operations and inflation we are at risk for inventory imbalances and the potential for higher than normal levels of markdowns to sell through our inventory increased cost of goods and for lost sales due to insufficient inventory to meet customer demand any of which would negatively affect our gross margins and our operating results 

we purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans if our actual demand is lower than our sales plans we may experience excess inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory resulting in decreased profit margins inflation may cause our costs to purchase inventory to be higher than we planned and we may not be able to sell the inventory to our customers at correspondingly increased prices resulting in decreased profit margins we also may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales opportunities the covid19 pandemic and accompanying economic impacts may change shopping behavior so that our predictions and sales plans become less accurate and that may lead us to have higher than usual levels of slowmoving or nonsalable inventory at our prior planned price levels we would then need to aggressively and progressively reduce our selling prices in order to clear out that inventory which would result in decreased profit margins or losses on sales of that inventory and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

as a regular part of our business we purchase “packaway” inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans but it typically remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory if we make packaway purchases that do not align with consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores we could have significant inventory markdowns changes in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow although we have various systems to help protect against loss or theft of our inventory both when in storage and once distributed to our stores we may have damaged lost or stolen inventory called “shortage” in higher amounts than we forecast which would result in writeoffs lost sales and reduced margins 

we depend on the market availability quantity and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices 

opportunistic buying lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our offprice business strategy maintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is also key to our ability to attract customers and sustain our sales and gross margins our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with our merchants who are in the marketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season our ability to meet or exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that we can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers to the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced to the extent that certain of our vendors decide not to sell to us or go out of business the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could also be materially reduced because a significant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries constraints on the availability of shipping capacity changes in transportation costs or in us tariffs trade relationships or tax policies and natural disasters or public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics that reduce the supply or increase the 

relative cost of imported goods could also result in disruptions to our existing supply relationships shortages delays or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality valuepriced merchandise would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and margins 

information or data security breaches including cyberattacks on our transaction processing and computer information systems could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of customer credit card employee or other private and valuable information that we handle in the ordinary course of our business disrupt our operations damage our reputation and increase our costs 

like other large retailers we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process transmit and store payment card and other personal and confidential information and to provide information or data security for those transactions some of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check approvals and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards are controlled by the banking and payment card industry not by us cybercriminals may attempt to penetrate our point of sale and other information systems to misappropriate customer or business information including but not limited to creditdebit card personnel or trade information cybercriminals including statesponsored actors may attempt to penetrate our information systems to deprive us from access to necessary business information and to disrupt our operations as part of socalled “ransomware” extortion activity or otherwise despite security measures we have in place and our efforts to prevent monitor and mitigate attacks and errors our facilities and systems or those of thirdparty service providers we utilize or connect to may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors phishing ransomware attacks and similar fraudulent attacks or other similar events it is also possible that an associate within our company or a third party we do business with may purposefully or inadvertently cause a security breach involving such information the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals the increased potential for cyberattacks and the advances in computer capabilities and remote access increases these risks a breach of our information or data security a system shut down or other response we may take or our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a loss of personal or business information could result in damage to our reputation loss of customer confidence violation or alleged violation of applicable laws including laws relating to consumer data protection and privacy and required notifications of data security breaches and expose us to civil claims litigation and regulatory action and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations 

disruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver product to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner 

various information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business we depend on the integrity continuous availability and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores track inventory flow manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics generate performance and financial reports and support merchandising decisions 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace information processes and systems that are key to managing our business we must monitor and choose sound investments and implement them at the right pace the risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken an excessive rate of technological change could detract from the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from new technology poorly targeting opportunities failing to make good investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could damage our competitive position and adversely impact our business and results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system changes could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide us with the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

our information systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures cyberattacks computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as severe storms fires earthquakes floods acts of terrorism and design or usage errors by our employees or by third parties if our information systems or our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport merchandise to our stores or our distribution centers which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or increased supply chain costs such disruptions may result from 

public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics cyberattacks damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters trade restrictions tariffs thirdparty strikes or ineffective cross dock operations work stoppages or slowdowns shipping capacity constraints supply or shipping interruptions or other factors beyond our control any such disruptions could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

we need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth 

successful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas we compete with other retailers and businesses for acceptable store locations for the purpose of identifying locations we rely in part on consumer demographics while we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations we recognize that this information cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy time frames for negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected cancellations we may not be able to open new stores or if opened operate those new stores profitably construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results additionally we may not be able to renegotiate our current lease terms which could negatively impact our operating results new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability of other existing stores if we cannot acquire sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the economics of our new stores in various markets 

to achieve growth we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets 

our growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our offprice model in current markets and in new geographic regions there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets stores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction occupancy advertising or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets thereby affecting our overall profitability new markets may have competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may require us to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and retain qualified associates 

consumer problems or legal issues involving the quality safety or authenticity of products we sell could harm our reputation result in lost sales andor increase our costs 

various governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell these regulations and related laws frequently change and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated because of our opportunistic buying strategy we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors that we have not dealt with before although our vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally rely on our vendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable product safety and other laws vendor noncompliance with consumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls make certain products unsalable or require us to incur significant compliance costs 

regardless of fault any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we offer particularly products such as food and children’s items issues with the authenticity of merchandise or our inability or that of our vendor to comply on a timely basis with laws and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our reputation result in lost sales inventory writeoffs uninsured product liability or other legal claims penalties or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs 

an adverse outcome in various legal regulatory or tax matters could damage our reputation or brand and increase our costs 

as an ordinary part of our business we are involved in various legal proceedings regulatory reviews tax audits andor other legal matters these may include lawsuits inquiries demands or other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and private plaintiffs including those relating to employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination harassment wage and hour and retaliation securities real estate tort commercial consumer protection privacy product compliance and safety advertising environmental comparative pricing product labeling intellectual property tax escheat and whistleblower claims we continue to be involved in a number of employmentrelated lawsuits including classrepresentative actions which are primarily in california 

we are subject to federal state and local rules and regulations in the united states and to various international laws which change from time to time these legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business including the cost of health care workforce management and employee benefits minimum wages advertising comparative pricing importexport sourcing and manufacturing data protection including customer and associate data privacy choice and notification rights intellectual property and others if we fail to comply or are alleged not to comply with any of these requirements we may be subject to fines settlements penalties or other costs in addition an adverse outcome or the adverse publicity from the claims in any of these matters may damage our reputation or brand we are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state and local tax authorities and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take 

significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax provisions and reserves for legal claims actual results may differ and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes in addition applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and those changes could have material effects on our reported operating results and financial condition 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

our reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry such an incident could also include alleged acts or omissions by or situations involving our suppliers or their contractors or subcontractors the landlord for our stores or our associates outside of work and may pertain to social or political issues or protests largely unrelated to our business the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons continues to increase the availability of information whether correct or erroneous on social media platforms is virtually immediate as is its impact many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content the opportunity for dissemination of information including inaccurate information is seemingly limitless and readily available information concerning our company may be posted on such platforms at any time information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate which could negatively affect our sales diminish customer trust reduce employee morale and productivity and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified associates the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction   

our inability to continually attract train and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our offprice retail strategies along with labor shortages increased turnover or increased labor costs could adversely affect our operating results 

like other retailers we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization management stores distribution centers and other key areas many of our retail store associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or healthcare benefits 

any increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or if we fail to pay such higher wages may result in increased turnover excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding hiring and training new associates if we cannot hire enough qualified associates or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from thirdparty providers especially during our peak seasons our operations could be negatively impacted 

because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must also attract train and retain our key associates across the company especially within our buying organization the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our growth operations or financial position 

we must effectively advertise and market our business 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of our stores although we use marketing and advertising programs to attract customers to our stores particularly through television and digital channels our competitors may spend more or use different approaches which could provide them with a competitive advantage 

our advertising and other promotional programs may not be effective or may be perceived negatively or could require increased expenditures any of which could adversely affect sales or increase costs 

we are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries 

risks in importing and selling such merchandise include import duties and quotas compliance with antidumping regulations economic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions including shipping capacity limitations cost increases inflation recession and exchange rate fluctuations foreign government regulations employment and labor matters concerns relating to human rights working conditions and other issues in factories or countries where merchandise is produced transparency of sourcing and supply chains exposure on product warranty and intellectual property issues consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise wars and fears of war political unrest natural disasters regulations to address climate change and trade restrictions 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell even when we purchase it domestically often as excess inventory sold to us by a domestic vendor is originally manufactured in other countries in addition we directly source a portion of the products sold in our stores from foreign vendors predominantly in asia including china we also buy products that originate from foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors and manufacturers’ representatives although our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors when we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer 

to the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products any event causing a disruption delay or increase in the cost of imports including the imposition of import or other restrictions such as product detention war acts of terrorism natural disasters or public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics could adversely affect our business the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by global shipping capacity limitations or by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas or both applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us we cannot predict whether any of the countries from which our products are sourced or in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments or the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions 

we require our vendors for both import and domestic purchasing to contractually confirm that they adhere to various conduct compliance and other requirements including those relating to environmental employment and labor including wages and working conditions health safety and antibribery standards from time to time our vendors their contractors or their subcontractors may be alleged to not be in compliance with these standards or with applicable local laws although we have implemented policies and procedures to promote compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise and to monitor the compliance of our suppliers this does not guarantee that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate or not allegedly violate such laws and regulations or our policies significant or continuing noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation could subject us to claims and liability and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in us tax or trade policy regarding apparel and homerelated merchandise produced in other countries could adversely affect our business 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries the us government has at times indicated a willingness to significantly change existing trade policies including those with china this exposes us to risks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise and creates increased uncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins changes in us tariffs quotas trade relationships or tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost of goods andor increase our effective tax rate although such changes would have implications across the entire industry we may fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes in addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in us laws and policies as we make business decisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes miss out on business opportunities or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are 

necessary in response to those changes these risks could adversely affect our revenues and expenses increase our effective tax rates and reduce our profitability 

we may experience volatility in revenues and earnings 

our business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and backtoschool seasons weather and other factors although our offprice business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers we may still experience unexpected decreases in sales from time to time which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins significant operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not adjust proportionately with our sales if sales in a certain period are lower than our plans we may not be able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently which could adversely affect our operating results 

a pandemic natural or manmade disaster in california or in another region where we have a concentration of stores offices or a distribution center could harm our business 

our corporate headquarters los angeles buying office 10 distribution centerswarehouses and approximately 23 of our stores are located in california natural or other disasters such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics wildfires earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes floods or other extreme weather and climate conditions or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism or public health issues in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain or could shut down damage or destroy our stores or distribution facilities 

to support our continuing operations our new store and distribution center growth plans our quarterly dividends and our stock repurchase program we must maintain sufficient liquidity the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions are adding significant uncertainty and challenges 

we depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities and to finance our operations make capital expenditures and acquisitions manage our debt levels and return value to our stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases while the pandemic continues disruptions to our operations may occur nationally regionally or in specific locations the situation is unprecedented and rapidly changing and has unknown duration and severity if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support our activities our growth plans and our financial performance would be adversely affected 

if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition if we do not properly allocate our capital resources to maximize returns our operations cash flows and returns to stockholders could be adversely affected 

we are subject to impacts from instances of damage to our stores and losses of merchandise accompanying protests or demonstrations which may result in temporary store closures 

there have been recent demonstrations and protests in cities throughout the united states while they have generally been peaceful in some locations they have been accompanied by violence damage to retail stores and the loss of merchandise while generally subject to coverage by insurance the repair of damage to our stores and replacement of lost merchandise may also increase our costs and temporarily disrupt store operations and we may incur increased operating costs for additional security governmental authorities in affected cities and regions may take actions in an effort to protect people and property while permitting lawful and nonviolent protests including curfews and restrictions on business operations which may be disruptive to our operations these activities governmental responses and resulting media coverage may also harm consumer confidence and perceptions of personal wellbeing and security which may negatively affect shopping behavior and our sales

our real estate strategy in 2022 is to primarily open stores in states where we currently operate with the objective to increase our market penetration and leverage our overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market we also expect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in 2022 important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the local trade area in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

the following table summarizes the locations of our stores by stateterritory as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021

we are also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business actions filed against us may include commercial product and product safety consumer intellectual property environmental and labor and employmentrelated claims including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that we violated federal state andor local laws actions against us are in various procedural stages many of these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties 

like many retailers and other businesses we have filed a lawsuit as plaintiff against the insurance companies with respect to our claims for insurance coverage for business interruption property damage and other losses that we have experienced as a result of the covid19 pandemic our suit was filed in alameda county california in december 2020 the proceedings remain in early stages and are subject to significant uncertainties

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

ross stores inc operates two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion stores—ross dress for less ® “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1628 locations in 40 states the district of columbia and guam as of january 29 2022 ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices every day we also operate 295 dd’s discounts stores in 21 states as of january 29 2022 that feature a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business and considering the pace and magnitude of the economic recovery as the covid19 pandemic subsides we are closely monitoring market share trends for the offprice industry we believe our share gains will continue to be driven mainly by continued focus on bringing value and convenience to our consumers our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the trends toward expanding market share of the offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 29 2022 january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 as fiscal 2021 fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively 

results of operations 

while the united states and other countries continued to experience the ongoing global covid19 coronavirus pandemic throughout fiscal 2021 the effects on our operations were less disruptive than in fiscal 2020 all of our store locations and distribution centers remained open and operating throughout fiscal 2021 in contrast to 2020 when our results reflected the significant revenue decline and other impacts from our chainwide store closures for approximately half of the first quarter and 25 percent of the second quarter as well as mandated occupancy restrictions and reduced operating hours that occurred throughout that year for fiscal 2021 we c ompare our results of operations to fiscal 2020 and also to fiscal 2019 we believe the extended closure of our operations in the spring of 2020 and the significant disruptions caused by covid19 throughout fiscal 2020 make fiscal 2019 a more useful and relevant basis for comparison to our fiscal 2021 performance in assessing our ongoing results of operations 

we achieved strong sales results in fiscal 2021 which benefited from a combination of government stimulus increasing vaccination rates diminishing covid19 restrictions pentup consumer demand and strong execution of our merchandising strategies we achieved these results despite the negative impacts from covid19 and related variants during fiscal 2021 especially the surge in omicron cases which depressed inperson shopping behavior during the peak holiday selling period and from continued supply chain congestion throughout the year we continued to experience expense pressures from higher domestic freight costs of approximately 95 basis points primarily due to the ongoing and worsening industrywide supply chain congestion compared to fiscal 2019 we also incurred ongoing covidrelated increased operating costs of approximately 35 basis points the vast majority of which impacted our selling general and administrative expenses we expect higher freight costs higher distribution expenses higher wages and ongoing covidrelated operating costs to continue during fiscal 2022 

there remains significant uncertainty related to the ongoing industrywide supply chain congestion we also face external risks from the effects of inflation both on consumer demand and on costs in our business in addition there continues to be significant uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic including its unknown duration the potential for further new virus variants and future resurgences as well as possible operational restrictions the ongoing effect of the pandemic on consumer behavior and shopping patterns and the potential adverse impact on our business 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 



stores total stores open at the end of fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 were 1923 1859 and 1805 respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 increased by 3 3 and 5 from the respective prior years in response to the impacts and uncertainties from the covid19 pandemic we reduced our pace of new store openings for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 looking forward to 2022 we expect to return to our historical annual opening program of approximately 100 new stores beyond fiscal 2022 we are planning for our pace of new store openings to be greater than our historical annual opening program of approximately 100 stores based on trends we perceive toward consumers’ increased focus on value and convenience favorable store performance in both our new and infill markets and the market share opportunities resulting from the significant number of brickandmortar retail closures and bankruptcies over the last several years our longer term strategy is to open additional stor es based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2021 increased 64 billion or 509 compared to the prior year this was primarily due to all store locations remaining open throughout fiscal 2021 compared to the negative impact from the covid19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the march 2020 to june 2020 period sales for fiscal 2021 also benefited from a combination of government stimulus payments increasing vaccination rates diminishing covid19 restrictions on operations pentup consumer demand and strong execution of our 

merchandising strategies sales also increased due to the opening of 64 net new stores between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 

sales for fiscal 2020 decreased 35 billion or 219 compared to fiscal 2019 this was primarily due to the negative impact from the covid19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the march 2020 to june 2020 period the negative impacts on customer demand from the covid19 pandemic mandated occupancy restrictions and reduced store operating hours during the remainder of fiscal 2020 we opened 54 net new stores during 2020 the sales from these new stores partially offset the overall sales decline 

sales for fiscal 2021 increased 29 billion or 179 compared to fiscal 2019 due to a 13 increase in sales from comparable stores and the opening of 118 net new stores between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2021 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 



we intend to address the competitive retail climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our merchant organization diversify our merchandise mix and more fully develop our systems to improve our merchandise offerings 

it is difficult to predict any future impact from some of the factors that benefited our sales results for fiscal 2021 in particular the benefit from the government stimulus payments and pentup consumer demand there remains significant uncertainty related to ongoing industrywide supply chain congestion we also face external risks from the effects of inflation both on consumer demand and on costs in our business in addition there continues to be significant uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic including its unknown duration the potential for new virus variants and future resurgences as well as possible operational restrictions the ongoing effect of the pandemic on consumer behavior and shopping patterns and the potential adverse impact on our business we cannot be sure that our strategies and our store expansion program will result in a continuation of our historical sales growth or an increase in net earnings 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2021 increased 39 billion compared to the prior year mainly due to higher sales given that all our stores were open throughout fiscal 2021 compared to the negative impact from the covid19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the march 2020 to june 2020 period cost of goods also increased due to the opening of 64 net new stores between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2020 decreased 17 billion compared to fiscal 2019 mainly due to the lower sales from the temporary covid19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the march 2020 to june 2020 period  and ensuing negative impacts on shopping behavior and customer demand due to the covid19 pandemic after our store reopenings as well as lower costs from the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our distribution centers and some associates in our buying offices these decreases were partially offset by higher markdowns used to clear aged and seasonal inventory higher distribution costs primarily due to increased wages and higher freight costs due to industrywide supply chain congestion added expenditures for covid19 related measures and higher occupancy costs from the opening of 54 net new stores during 2020 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2021 increased 22 billion co mpared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a 13 increase in comparable store sales higher freight and distribution costs primarily due to industrywide supply chain congestion and higher wages and higher sales due to the opening of 118 net new stores between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2021 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2021 increased approximately 55 b asis points from fiscal 2019 primarily due to a 95 basis point increase in domestic freight costs mainly driven by worsening industrywide supply chain congestion a 30 basis point increase in distribution expenses mainly driven by higher wages and a 10 basis point increase in buying costs these increases were partially offset by leverage of 60 basis points in occupancy costs and a 20 basis point improvement in merchandise gross margin 

we expect higher supply chain costs from the industrywide congestion and higher wages to continue throughout fiscal 2022 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 3712 million co mpared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to all our stores remaining open throughout fiscal 2021 compared to the impact from the covid19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the march 2020 to june 2020 period and to the opening of 64 net new stores between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021  partially offset by approximately 240 million in longterm debt refinancing costs incurred in fiscal 2020  

for fiscal 2020 sga increased 1466 million compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to approximately 240 million in longterm debt refinancing costs covidrelated expenses primarily for supplies cleaning and payroll related to additional safety protocols and payments to associates while our stores were closed net of employee retention credits under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” partially offset by payrollrelated cost reduction measures in response to the covid19 pandemic including the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our stores during closure periods and some associates in our corporate offices reductions in nonbusiness critical operating expenses and lower store operating expenses on lower sales 

for fiscal 2021 sga increased 5178 million co mpared to fiscal 2019 mainly due to a 13 increase in comparable store sales the opening of 118 net new stores between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2021  higher incentive compensation costs due to betterthanexpected results net covidrelated operating expenses primarily for supplies cleaning and payroll related to additional safety protocols higher wages and holiday related pay incentives 

sga as a perce ntage of sales for fiscal 2021 increased by approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs due to betterthanexpected results net covidrelated operating expenses for supplies cleaning and payroll related to additional safety protocols higher wages and holiday related pay incentives 

we expect our operating costs in fiscal 2022 to continue to reflect ongoing covidrelated expenses and also higher wages 

interest expense income net in fiscal 2021 net interest expense decreased by 91 million compared to 2020 primarily due to the elimination of interest expense on shortterm debt due to the repayment of our 800 million revolving credit facility in october 2020 and higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our brookshire texas distribution center partially offset by lower interest income due to lower interest rates 

in fiscal 2020 net interest expense increased by 1015 million compared to 2019 primarily due to higher interest expense on longterm debt due to the issuance of senior notes in april 2020 and october 2020 net of repurchase of senior notes lower interest income due to lower interest rates and higher interest expense on shortterm debt due to the draw down on our 800 million revolving credit facility in march 2020 which was subsequently repaid in october 2020 partially offset by higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our brookshire texas distribution center 

in fiscal 2021 net interest expense increased by 924 million compared to 2019 primarily due to higher interest expense on longterm debt due to the issuance of senior notes in april 2020 and october 2020 net of repurchase of senior notes and lower interest income due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our brookshire texas distribution center 

the table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 



taxes on earnings our effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 were approximately 24  20 and 23 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate of 4 for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and the decrease of 3 for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the impact of hiring tax credits on lower pretax earnings in fiscal 2020  the increase in effective tax rate of 1 for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to resolution of uncertain tax positions with a state tax authority during fiscal 2019 

our effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns our effective rate is impacted by changes in tax law and accounting guida nce location of new stores level of earnings tax effects associated with sharebased compensation and the resolution of tax positions with various tax authorities 

in fiscal 2020 the cares act was signed into law the cares act made several significant changes to business tax provisions including modifications for net operating losses employee retention credits and deferral of employer payroll tax payments the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 “caa” was signed into law during fiscal 2020 the caa made several changes to business tax provisions including extending certain employmentrelated tax credits through december 31 2025 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2021 were higher than in fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold lower sga expenses and lower interest expense partially offset by higher taxes on earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2020 were lower compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher cost of goods sold higher sga expenses and higher interest expense net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2021 were lower than in fiscal 2019 primarily due t o higher cost of goods sold higher sga expenses and higher interest expense partially offset by lower taxes on earnings 

earnings per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 was 487 compared to 024 in the prior year the higher diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 were primarily attributable to all our store locations remaining open throughout fiscal 2021 compared to the negative impact from the covid19 related closures of all of our stores during a significant portion of the march 2020 to june 2020 period 

diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was 024 compared to 460 in fiscal 2019 the lower diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to lower sales due to the closing of all our store locations during a significant portion of the march 2020 to june 2020 period and the negative impacts on shopping behavior and customer demand due to the covid19 pandemic higher markdowns to clear aged and seasonal inventory longterm debt refinancing costs payments to associates while our stores were closed net of employee retention credits under the cares act and higher expenditures for covid19 related measures 

diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 was 487  compared to 460 in fiscal 2019  the 6 increase in diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2019 was attributable to a 4 increase in net earnings and to the reduction in weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding of 2 for fiscal 2021 largely due to stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary sources of funds for our business activities have been cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll operating and variable lease costs taxes and for capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores and investments in distribution centers information systems and buying and corporate offices we also use cash to pay dividends to repay debt as it becomes due and to repurchase stock under active stock repurchase programs 



in this report we compare our cash flows from operating activities to both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 we believe fiscal 2019 is a more useful and relevant basis of comparison given that our stores were open for full 52week periods in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019 our cash flows from investing and financing activities are compared to fiscal 2020 given the construction of our brookshire texas distribution center during fiscal 2020 and 2021 and the significant financing actions we took in fiscal 2020 to preserve our financial liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility in response to the covid19 pandemic 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 17 billion in fiscal 2021 this was primarily driven by net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation partially offset by higher merchandise inventory receipts net of accounts payable net cash provided by operating activities was 22 billion in fiscal 2020 this was primarily driven by higher accounts payable due to longer payme nt terms lower merchandise receipts as we closely managed inventory levels and used packaway inventory to replenish our stores and net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation net cash provided by operating activities was 22 billion in fiscal 2019 and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation and for deferred taxes 

the de crease in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by lower accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory partially offset by higher net earnings in the current year accounts payable leverage was 105 and 150 as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 respectively the decrease in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by higher merchandise receipts to support higher sales and to replenish our packaway inventory  

the increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by higher accounts payable leverage accounts payable leverage was 150 and 71 as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 respectively the increase in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by lower packaway and instore inventory and longer payment terms 

the decrease in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by higher merchandise receipts to support higher sales and to replenish packaway inventory partially offset by higher incentive bonus accruals and higher net earnings 

as a regular part of our business packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise purchase opportunities in the marketplace and our decisions on the timing for release of that inventory packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies 

by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers 

changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow at the end of fiscal 2021 packaway inventory was 40 of total inventory compared to 38 and 46 at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 5578 million  4054 million and 5550 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively and was related to capital expenditures our capital expenditures include costs to build expand and improve distribution centers primarily related to the construction of our brookshire texas distribution center open new stores and improve existing stores and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems buying and corporate offices 

the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures related to the resumption of capital projects deferred during fiscal 2020  the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to our actions to preserve our financial liquidity in response to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions we opened 65 66 and 98 new stores in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 



capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are projected to be approximately 800 million  our planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to be used for investments in our supply chain to support longterm growth including construction of our next distribution center costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open planned new ross and dd’s discounts stores investments in certain information technology systems and for various other needed expenditures related to our stores distribution centers buying and corporate offices we expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash the increase i n our planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 is primarily driven by the upgrade or remodeling of existing stores costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open planned new ross and dd’s discounts stores construction of our next distribution center investments in information technology systems and for various other needed expenditures related to our stores distribution centers buying and corporate offices 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 12 billion in fiscal 2021 net cash provided by financing activities was 17 billion in fiscal 2020 net cash used in financing activities was 17 billion in fiscal 2019 the decrease in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the completion of our public debt offerings net of refinancing costs in fiscal 2020 the resumption of our share repurchases in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 the resumption of cash dividend payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and the repayment of our series b unsecured senior notes  the increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the completion of our public debt offerings net of repurchase and refinancing costs in fiscal 2020 and the suspension of our share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of 2020 

revolving credit facilities in february 2022 the “effective date” we entered into a new 13 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement the “2022 credit facility” which replaced our previous 800 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “prior credit facility” the 2022 credit facility expires in february 2027 and may be extended at our option for up to two additional one year periods subject to customary conditions the new facility contains a 300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit it also contains an option allowing us to increase the size of our credit facility by up to an additional 700 million with the agreement of the committing lenders the interest rate on borrowings under the 2022 credit facility is a term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate “term sofr” or an alternate benchmark rate if term sofr is no longer available plus an applicable margin and is payable quarterly and upon maturity the 2022 credit facility is subject to a quarterly consolidated adjusted debt to consolidated ebitdar financial leverage ratio covenant effective the first quarter of fiscal 2022 

on the effective date of the 2022 credit facility the prior credit facility was terminated and was replaced by the new 2022 credit facility as of january 29 2022  we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the prior credit facility the 800 million credit facility remained in place and available and we were in compliance with the financial covenant

shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for our merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit bank credit facility and other credit sources to meet our capital and liquidity requirements including lease and interest payment obligations 

during fiscal 2021 and 2019 our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations during fiscal 2020 our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations and our longterm debt financing 

we ended fiscal 2021 with 49 billion of unrestricted cash balances and as of the effective date we have 13 billion available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility we estimate that existing cash and cash equivalent balances cash flows from operations bank credit facility and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital investments common stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next 12 months 

contractual obligations 

the table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of january 29 2022 



supply chain finance program we facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program the “program” to provide certain suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to a participating financial institution at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institution a third party administers the program our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution we do not enter into agreements with the participating financial institution in connection with the program the range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program 

all outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets the amounts owed to a participating financial institution under the program and included in accounts payable were 2727 million and 156 million at january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 respectively we account for all payments made under the program as a reduction to operating cash flows in accounts payable within the consolidated statements of cash flows the amounts settled through the program and paid to the participating financial institution were 4301 million and 26 million during fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively

other 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting estimates describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates 

merchandise inventory our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weightedaverage basis or net realizable value merchandise inventory includes acquisition transportation pr ocessing and storage costs related to packaway inventory included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as determined through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our provision for shortage to be reliable if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required beyond our normal markdowns taken to clear seasonal and aged inventory as a measure of sensitivity a five percent change in shortage rates as of january 29 2022 would not have materially impacted our cost of goods sold in fiscal 2021 

lease accounting in determining the present value of lease payments for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets we use the estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date since our leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate this rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the riskadjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and assumptions including credit rating credit spread and adjustments for the impact of collateral changes in these inputs can increase or decrease the recorded operating lease assets and related lease liabilities for new leases and for remeasurements or modifications of existing leases we believe that this 

approximates the rate we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term 

insurance obligations we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation general liability and employeerelated health care benefits our selfinsurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required a five percent increase or decrease in our insurance reserves would not have materially impacted our net earnings in fiscal 2021

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of january 29 2022 

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 29 2022 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

as of january 29 2022 we have outstanding seven series of unsecured senior notes interest that is payable on all series of our senior notes is based on fixed interest rates and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates 

we receive interest on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended january 29 2022 we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible nearterm changes in interest rates to be material

we believe our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders delivery is made to one of our distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on purchases 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as “closeout” purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at great values or can be stored as packaway merchandise 

packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2020 we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 38 and 46 of total inventories as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 respectively we believe the strong discounts we offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

our primary buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nation’s two largest apparel markets we also operate a smaller buying office located in boston these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market frequently sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers thes e locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

at the end of fiscal 2020 we had over 900 merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct and each includes merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have on average eight years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in our merchant organization to further develop our relationships with our manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing we sell brand name merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brand name merchandise that is priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing is reflected on most of our price tags which display our selling price as well as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

as of january 30 2021 we operated a total of 1859 stores comprised of 1585 ross stores and 274 dd’s discounts stores our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit we cluster ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management we do the same for dd’s discounts stores 

we believe a key element of our success at both ross and dd’s discounts is our organized attractive and easytoshop instore environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasurehunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers our stores have shopping carts andor baskets available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing in response to the health pandemic from the novel coronavirus covid19 we implemented enhanced safety protocols for our customers and associates including social distancing measures and capacity restrictions 

we accept a variety of payment methods we provide refunds or store credit on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to do this are labor costs that are generally lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

in response to covid19 we implemented additional processes and procedures to facilitate social distancing to enhance cleaning and sanitation activities and to provide personal protective equipment to our associates which has increased our operating costs we expect to incur higher operating costs during the covid19 pandemic 

information systems 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include continued enhancements to our collaboration cybersecurity merchandise planning distribution store and human resource systems these initiatives support future growth the execution and achievement of our plans ongoing stability and compliance as well as our ability to work remotely during the covid19 pandemic 

distribution 

we operate distribution processing facilities where we receive and ship all of our merchandise to our stores these distribution centers are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model an additional distribution center in brookshire texas is currently under construction and expected to open in 2022 we also operate warehouse facilities for packaway storage 

we utilize a combination of our own and thirdparty cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our distribution centers and warehouses with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing and storage capacity to support our current store growth information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

advertising 

advertising for ross dress for less relies primarily on television to communicate the ross value proposition—savings off the same brands carried at leading department or specialty stores every day this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position while television is our primary advertising medium we continue to grow additional channels including social and digital media to communicate our brand position advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on radio both broadcast and digital social media and new store grand openings 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross ®  ross dress for less ®  and dd’s discounts ® have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

human capital 

as of january 30 2021 we had approximately 93700 total associates which includes both full and parttime associates additionally we hire temporary associates especially during the peak seasons our associates are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our associates to be good 

our associates play essential roles in delivering great value to our customers throughout our organization we recognize and appreciate the importance of attracting retaining and developing our associates and we have a number of key programs to do so 

talent development the professional growth of our associates is important to our success as a business we identify and enumerate key competencies we believe are critical to our ability to execute our business model and deliver the values our customers expect we utilize these competencies in the hiring development evaluation and future planning of our teams we provide training opportunities to help associates grow and build their careers our associates managers and executives may participate in technical and leadership development activities we support associates interested in leadership roles by offering opportunities to gain experience and build the skills necessary to advance within the company we are proud that many store leaders started their careers with us as retail associates 

diversity equality and inclusion we care about our associates and the communities we serve we are committed to building diverse teams and an inclusive culture that respects values and celebrates the diversity of 

backgrounds identities and ideas of those who work and shop with us we are focused on executing strategies to support our commitment to diversity equality and inclusion 

community and social impact we provide our associates the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social impact through various programs such as our matching gift program volunteer time off for eligible associates and a scholarship program for our associates and their dependents 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customers and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization we also continue to make improvements to our merchandising systems to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we operate in an attractive sector of retail that will be facing much less brick and mortar competition given the significant number of retail closures and bankruptcies we believe that we remain wellpositioned within the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry to compete based on these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from online retailers department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2020 and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain forwardlooking statements with respect to anticipated future events including the rapidly developing challenges with and our plans and responses to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions our future financial performance operations competitive position and our projected growth that are all subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and from our prior expectations and projections refer to management’s discussion and analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of “forwardlooking statements” 

our financial condition results of operations cash flows and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors risks and uncertainties that apply to both ross and dd’s discounts include without limitation the following 

the covid19 pandemic continues to severely and adversely affect our sales and our operations and we expect it to continue to have serious adverse effects on our business and our financial performance 

the united states and other countries are experiencing a major prolonged global covid19 pandemic with related significant disruptions and restrictions to retail operations and supply chains and to general economic activities as the affected regions have taken dramatic actions sometimes including mandatory capacity restrictions reduced operating hours and closure of retail operations in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease 

as the covid19 pandemic continues many of our customers and associates are being impacted by recommendations andor mandates from federal state and local authorities to stay home “shelter in place” or “safer at home” to avoid nonessential social contact and gatherings of people and to selfquarantine following a chainwide closure from late march 2020 to midmay 2020 all of our distribution centers and substantially all of our 

store locations have been operating since the end of june 2020 while vaccines have become available and a steadily increasing portion of the population is being vaccinated it will take time for those efforts to reach levels that permit a relaxation in the social restrictions additional outbreaks and spreading of the disease have been occurring in many places across the united states and while levels of spread have gone up and down in different regions health officials continue to warn of further potential disruptions and quarantine responses state and local “work from home” recommendations and mandates have been in effect for many of our corporate offices and may continue for some time store closures and distribution center closures may be required again nationally regionally or in specific locations 

the situation continues to be unprecedented and rapidly changing and has unknown duration and severity we have a concentration of store locations in the states of california texas and florida together those states include almost fifty percent of our stores and they have each reported regional “hot spots” and increasing numbers of cases in recent months which have already resulted in strict customer capacity limits limits to our hours of operations and curfews and in mandatory store closures in certain areas “stay at home” measures continue to discourage inperson shopping and to reduce traffic in our stores more than half of our distribution centers and warehouses are located in california a required closure of these facilities would be very disruptive to our ability to supply merchandise to our stores the temporary closure of our stores and distribution centers early in 2020 resulted in a significant loss of sales and profits and had material adverse effects on our financial condition in addition the covid19 pandemic may potentially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff our distribution centers our stores and our merchant and other support operations further the covid19 pandemic has severely impacted multiple countries which may also adversely affect our ability to access and ship products from the affected regions 

the prolonged widespread pandemic has adversely impacted global economies which has resulted in an economic downturn that may reduce consumer demand for our products the extent and duration of the impact from the covid19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the us regional surges in infection the effectiveness of vaccines in controlling the virus or current or future variants of the virus the response by all levels of government in their efforts to contain the outbreak and to mitigate the economic disruptions and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted such impacts have and are expected to adversely affect our profitability cash flows financial results and our capital resources 

we are subject to impacts from the macroeconomic environment financial and credit markets and geopolitical conditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income the covid19 pandemic may have prolonged and significant negative effects on consumer confidence shopping behavior and spending which may adversely affect our sales and gross margins 

consumer spending habits for the merchandise we sell are affected by many factors currently the repercussions from the covid19 pandemic are unknown and present significant risks and uncertainty there is significant uncertainty over potential changes in consumer behavior and shopping patterns as the pandemic continues and as different regions experience surges other factors include levels of unemployment the size and timing of federal stimulus programs salaries and wage rates prevailing economic conditions recession and fears of recession housing costs energy and fuel costs income tax rates and the timing of tax refunds inflation consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer perceptions of personal wellbeing and security availability of consumer credit consumer debt levels and consumers’ disposable income the covid19 pandemic and other potential adverse developments in any of these areas could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins all of our stores are located in the united states and its territories so we are especially susceptible to changes in the us economy   

we need to successfully operate under the health and safety measures implemented in our stores and distribution centers and across all our operations to comply with regulatory requirements and with the goal of keeping our customers and associates safe from the spread of the covid19 virus without disruptions to our operations 

we have implemented a variety of measures in our stores locations distribution centers and other facilities with the goal of keeping our associates customers and the communities we serve safe from spreading the covid19 virus these measures include additional cleaning and sanitation of stores and workspaces return merchandise quarantining providing associates with personal protective equipment based on cdc or other federal state or local health guidelines and implementing physical distancing practices in our stores distribution centers and in our other operations this is very challenging to do and there is significant risk incremental costs and uncertainty regarding requirements and their implementation not only are these measures new and evolving but they often require change to established habits and patterns of behavior by large groups of people who may not fully 

understand or agree with the requested changes whatever measures we adopt there will also be challenges in effecting consistent compliance by our customers and our associates we will need to adapt and change these measures over time and as we learn from experience and despite our efforts and best intentions incidents of infection will occur at our stores distribution centers andor in our other facilities potentially resulting in serious illness for those affected including our associates this may result in required temporary closure of specific stores distribution centers or other facilities and in temporary or longer term loss of key personnel during illness and potential supply chain disruptions we may also face claims with or without merit that our retail stores or our other facilities and workplaces are operating in an unsafe manner or are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations any such incidents may adversely affect our operating results increase our costs and damage our reputation and competitive position 

competitive pressures in the apparel and homerelated merchandise retailing industry are high 

the retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store and online formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector we compete for customers associates store locations and merchandise with many other local regional and national retailers traditional department stores upscale mass merchandisers other offprice retailers specialty stores internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing business strategies and promotional activity particularly during holiday periods in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition the substantial sales growth in ecommerce within the last decade has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors new business models and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online shopping alternatives intense pressures from our competitors our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape or a failure to effectively execute our offprice model could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause us to take greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins 

unexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and homerelated merchandise could adversely affect us 

our success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand we work on an ongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer needs it is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the multiple markets in which we operate throughout the united states and its territories although our offprice business model provides us certain advantages and may allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers have in adjusting our merchandise mix to everchanging consumer tastes our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer trends and preferences particularly in our newer geographic markets failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends preferences and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

adverse andor unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and other merchandise and may result in temporary store closures and disruptions in deliveries of merchandise to our stores 

unseasonable weather and prolonged extreme temperatures as well as events such as storms affect consumers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop and may adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise among other things weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or require us to close certain stores temporarily thereby reducing store traffic even if stores are not closed many customers may be unable to go or may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather as a result adverse or unseasonable weather in any of our markets could lead to disappointing sales and cause us to increase our markdowns which may negatively affect our sales and margins 

in order to achieve our planned gross margins we must effectively manage our inventories markdowns and inventory shortage as a result of potential changes in shopping behaviors due to the covid19 pandemic and potential disruptions to supply chains and store operations we are at risk for inventory imbalances and the potential for higher than normal levels of markdowns to sell through our inventory which would negatively affect our gross margins and our operating results 

we purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans if our actual demand is lower than our sales plans we may experience excess inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory resulting in decreased profit margins we also may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales opportunities the covid19 pandemic may cause changes in shopping behavior and restrictions on our operations so that our predictions and sales plans are less accurate and that may lead us to 

have higher than usual levels of slowmoving or nonsalable inventory at our prior planned price levels we would need to aggressively and progressively reduce our selling prices in order to clear out that inventory which would result in decreased profit margins or losses on sales of that inventory and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

as a regular part of our business we purchase “packaway” inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores varies by merchandise category and by season but it typically remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory if we make packaway purchases that do not align with consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores we could have significant inventory markdowns changes in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow although we have various systems to help protect against loss or theft of our inventory both when in storage and once distributed to our stores we may have damaged lost or stolen inventory called “shortage” in higher amounts than we forecast which would result in writeoffs lost sales and reduced margins 

we depend on the market availability quantity and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices 

opportunistic buying lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our offprice business strategy maintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is also key to our ability to attract customers and sustain our sales and gross margins our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with our merchants who are in the marketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season our ability to meet or exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that we can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers to the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced to the extent that certain of our vendors decide not to sell to us or go out of business the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could also be materially reduced because a significant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries constraints on the availability of shipping capacity changes in transportation costs or in us tariffs trade relationships or tax policies and natural disasters or public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of imported goods could also result in disruptions to our existing supply relationships shortages delays or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality valuepriced merchandise would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and margins 

information or data security breaches including cyberattacks on our transaction processing and computer information systems could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of customer credit card employee or other private and valuable information that we handle in the ordinary course of our business disrupt our operations damage our reputation and increase our costs 

like other large retailers we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process transmit and store payment card and other personal and confidential information and to provide information or data security for those transactions some of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check approvals and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards are controlled by the banking and payment card industry not by us cybercriminals may attempt to penetrate our point of sale and other information systems to misappropriate customer or business information including but not limited to creditdebit card personnel or trade information despite security measures we have in place and our efforts to prevent monitor and mitigate attacks and errors our facilities and systems or those of thirdparty service providers we utilize or connect to may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors phishing and similar fraudulent attacks or other similar events it is also possible that an associate within our company or a third party we do business with may purposefully or inadvertently cause a security breach involving such information the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals and advances in computer capabilities and remote access increases these risks a breach of our information or data security a system shut down or other response we may take or our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a loss of personal or business information could result in damage to our reputation loss of customer confidence violation or alleged violation of applicable laws including laws relating to consumer data protection and privacy and required notifications of data security breaches and expose us to civil claims litigation and regulatory action and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations 

disruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver product to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner 

various information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business we depend on the integrity continuous availability and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores track inventory flow manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics generate performance and financial reports and support merchandising decisions 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace information processes and systems that are key to managing our business we must monitor and choose sound investments and implement them at the right pace the risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken an excessive rate of technological change could detract from the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from new technology poorly targeting opportunities failing to make good investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could damage our competitive position and adversely impact our business and results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system changes could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide us with the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

our information systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as severe storms fires earthquakes floods acts of terrorism and design or usage errors by our employees or by third parties if our information systems or our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport merchandise to our stores or our distribution centers which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or increased supply chain costs such disruptions may result from public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters trade restrictions tariffs thirdparty strikes or ineffective cross dock operations work stoppages or slowdowns shipping capacity constraints supply or shipping interruptions or other factors beyond our control any such disruptions could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

we need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth 

successful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas we compete with other retailers and businesses for acceptable store locations for the purpose of identifying locations we rely in part on consumer demographics while we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations we recognize that this information cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy time frames for negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected cancellations we may not be able to open new stores or if opened operate those new stores profitably construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results additionally we may not be able to renegotiate our current lease terms which could negatively impact our operating results new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability of other existing stores if we cannot acquire sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the economics of our new stores in various markets 

to achieve growth we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets 

our growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our offprice model in current markets and in new geographic regions there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets stores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction occupancy advertising or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets thereby affecting our overall profitability new markets may have competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may require us to build 

brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and retain qualified associates 

consumer problems or legal issues involving the quality safety or authenticity of products we sell could harm our reputation result in lost sales andor increase our costs 

various governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell these regulations and related laws frequently change and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated because of our opportunistic buying strategy we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors that we have not dealt with before although our vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally rely on our vendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable product safety and other laws vendor noncompliance with consumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls make certain products unsalable or require us to incur significant compliance costs 

regardless of fault any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we offer particularly products such as food and children’s items issues with the authenticity of merchandise or our inability or that of our vendors to comply on a timely basis with laws and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our reputation result in lost sales inventory writeoffs uninsured product liability or other legal claims penalties or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs 

an adverse outcome in various legal regulatory or tax matters could damage our reputation or brand and increase our costs 

as an ordinary part of our business we are involved in various legal proceedings regulatory reviews tax audits andor other legal matters these may include lawsuits inquiries demands or other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and private plaintiffs including those relating to employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination harassment wage and hour and retaliation securities real estate tort commercial consumer protection privacy product compliance and safety advertising comparative pricing product labeling intellectual property tax escheat and whistleblower claims we continue to be involved in a number of employmentrelated lawsuits including classrepresentative actions which are primarily in california 

we are subject to federal state and local rules and regulations in the united states and to various international laws which change from time to time these legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business including the cost of health care workforce management and employee benefits minimum wages advertising comparative pricing importexport sourcing and manufacturing data protection including customer and associate data privacy choice and notification rights intellectual property and others if we fail to comply or are alleged not to comply with any of these requirements we may be subject to fines settlements penalties or other costs in addition an adverse outcome or the adverse publicity from the claims in any of these matters may damage our reputation or brand we are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state and local tax authorities and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take 

significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax provisions and reserves for legal claims actual results may differ and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes in addition applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and those changes could have material effects on our reported operating results and financial condition 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

our reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry such an incident could also include alleged acts or omissions by or situations involving our suppliers or their contractors or subcontractors the landlord for our stores or our associates outside of work and may pertain to social or political issues or protests largely unrelated to our business the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons continues to increase the availability of information whether correct or erroneous on social media platforms is virtually immediate as is its impact many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content the opportunity for dissemination of information including inaccurate information is seemingly limitless and readily available information concerning our company may be posted on such platforms at any time information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate which could negatively affect our sales 

diminish customer trust reduce employee morale and productivity and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified associates the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction   

our inability to continually attract train and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our offprice retail strategies along with labor shortages increased turnover or increased labor costs could adversely affect our operating results 

like other retailers we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization management stores distribution centers and other key areas many of our retail store associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or healthcare benefits 

any increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or if we fail to pay such higher wages may result in increased turnover excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding hiring and training new associates if we cannot hire enough qualified associates or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from thirdparty providers especially during our peak seasons our operations could be negatively impacted 

because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must also attract train and retain our key associates across the company especially within our buying organization the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our growth operations or financial position 

we must effectively advertise and market our business 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of our stores although we use marketing and advertising programs to attract customers to our stores particularly through television and social media our competitors may spend more or use different approaches which could provide them with a competitive advantage our advertising and other promotional programs may not be effective or may be perceived negatively or could require increased expenditures any of which could adversely affect sales or increase costs 

we are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries 

risks in importing and selling such merchandise include import duties and quotas compliance with antidumping regulations economic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions including inflation recession and exchange rate fluctuations foreign government regulations employment and labor matters concerns relating to human rights working conditions and other issues in factories or countries where merchandise is produced transparency of sourcing and supply chains exposure on product warranty and intellectual property issues consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise wars and fears of war political unrest natural disasters regulations to address climate change and trade restrictions 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell even when we purchase it domestically often as excess inventory sold to us by a domestic vendor is originally manufactured in other countries in addition we directly source a portion of the products sold in our stores from foreign vendors predominantly in asia including china we also buy products that originate from foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors and manufacturers’ representatives although our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors when we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer 

to the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products any event causing a disruption delay or increase in the cost of imports including the imposition of import or other restrictions war acts of terrorism natural disasters or public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics could adversely affect our business the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by global shipping capacity limitations or by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas or both applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us we cannot predict whether any of the countries from which our products are sourced or in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the 

future will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments or the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions 

we require our vendors for both import and domestic purchasing to contractually confirm that they adhere to various conduct compliance and other requirements including those relating to environmental employment and labor including wages and working conditions health safety and antibribery standards from time to time our vendors their contractors or their subcontractors may be alleged to not be in compliance with these standards or with applicable local laws although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise and to monitor the compliance of our suppliers this does not guarantee that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation could subject us to claims and liability and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in us tax or trade policy regarding apparel and homerelated merchandise produced in other countries could adversely affect our business 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries the us government has at times indicated a willingness to significantly change existing trade policies including those with china this exposes us to risks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise and creates increased uncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins changes in us tariffs quotas trade relationships or tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost of goods andor increase our effective tax rate although such changes would have implications across the entire industry we may fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes in addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in us laws and policies as we make business decisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes miss out on business opportunities or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes these risks could adversely affect our revenues and expenses increase our effective tax rates and reduce our profitability 

we may experience volatility in revenues and earnings 

our business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and backtoschool seasons weather and other factors although our offprice business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers we may still experience unexpected decreases in sales from time to time which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins significant operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not adjust proportionately with our sales if sales in a certain period are lower than our plans we may not be able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently which could adversely affect our operating results 

a pandemic natural or manmade disaster in california or in another region where we have a concentration of stores offices or a distribution center could harm our business 

our corporate headquarters los angeles buying office nine distribution centerswarehouses and approximately 23 of our stores are located in california natural or other disasters such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics wildfires earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes floods or other extreme weather and climate conditions or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism or public health issues in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain or could shut down damage or destroy our stores or distribution facilities 

to support our continuing operations our new store and distribution center growth plans our quarterly dividends and any resumption of our stock repurchase program we must maintain sufficient liquidity the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruption are adding significant uncertainty and challenges 

we depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities and to supply capital to finance our operations make capital expenditures and acquisitions manage our debt levels and return value to our stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases the covid19 pandemic resulted in a prolonged period during the first half of 2020 in which we temporarily closed all store locations and distribution centers although our store and distribution center operations have remained substantially open since june of 2020 there have been ongoing regional restrictions on store operating capacity ongoing adversity in general economic conditions and adverse impact on consumer confidence and shopping behavior while the pandemic continues further closures or disruptions to our operations may be required nationally regionally or in specific 

locations the situation is unprecedented and rapidly changing and has unknown duration and severity if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support our activities our growth plans and our financial performance would be adversely affected 

we have borrowed on occasion to finance some of our activities in march 2020 we borrowed 800 million from our revolving credit facility subsequently repaid in the third quarter of 2020 in april 2020 we completed a 20 billion senior notes offering subsequently we refinanced 775 million in aggregate principal amount of those senior notes with the issuance of 10 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes these actions were taken to add to our cash balances in order to provide enhanced financial flexibility due to uncertain market conditions arising from the impact of the covid19 pandemic if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns our operations cash flows and returns to stockholders could be adversely affected 

we are subject to impacts from instances of damage to our stores and losses of merchandise accompanying protests or demonstrations which may result in temporary store closures 

there have been recent demonstrations and protests in cities throughout the united states while they have generally been peaceful in some locations they have been accompanied by violence damage to retail stores and the loss of merchandise while generally subject to coverage by insurance the repair of damage to our stores and replacement of lost merchandise may also increase our costs and temporarily disrupt store operations and we may incur increased operating costs for additional security governmental authorities in affected cities and regions may take actions in an effort to protect people and property while permitting lawful and nonviolent protests including curfews and restrictions on business operations which may be disruptive to our operations these activities governmental responses and resulting media coverage may also harm consumer confidence and perceptions of personal wellbeing and security which may negatively affect shopping behavior and our sales

at january 30 2021 we operated a total of 1859 stores of which 1585 were ross stores in 40 states the district of columbia and guam and 274 were dd’s discounts stores in 21 states all stores are leased with the exception of two locations which we own 

during fiscal 2020 we opened 50 new ross stores and closed 11 existing stores the average approximate ross store size is 28000 square feet 

during fiscal 2020 we opened 16 new dd’s discounts stores including reopening one store previously temporarily closed due to a weather event and closed one existing store the average approximate dd’s discounts store size is 23000 square feet 

during fiscal 2020 no one store accounted for more than 1 of our sales 

we carry fire flood wind and earthquake insurance to help mitigate the risk of financial loss that may result from such events 

our real estate strategy in 2021 is to primarily open stores in states where we currently operate to increase our market penetration and leverage overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market we also expect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in 2021 important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the local trade area in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

the following table summarizes the locations of our stores by stateterritory as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 



where possible we obtain sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations allowing us to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time at reasonable costs in a given market at january 30 2021 the majority of our stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years with three to four renewal options of five years each the average unexpired original lease term of our leased stores is approximately six years or approximately 20 years if renewal options are included see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we have been named in classrepresentative action lawsuits primarily in california alleging violation of wage and hour laws and consumer protection laws classrepresentative action litigation remains pending as of january 30 2021 

we are also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business actions filed against us may include commercial product and product safety consumer intellectual property environmental and labor and employmentrelated claims including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that we violated federal state andor local laws actions against us are in various procedural stages many of these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties 

like many retailers and other businesses we have filed a lawsuit as plaintiff against the insurance companies with respect to our claims for insurance coverage for business interruption property damage and other losses that we have experienced as a result of the covid19 pandemic our suit was filed in alameda county california in december 2020 the proceedings remain at an early procedural stage and are subject to significant uncertainties 

we believe that the resolution of our pending classrepresentative action litigation and other currently pending legal and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

ross stores inc operates two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion stores—ross dress for less ® “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1585 locations in 40 states the district of columbia and guam as of january 30 2021 ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices every day we also operate 274 dd’s discounts stores in 21 states as of january 30 2021 that feature a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business and considering the pace and magnitude of the economic recovery post the covid19 pandemic we are closely monitoring market share trends for the offprice industry and believe our share gains will continue to be driven mainly by continued focus on value and convenience by consumers our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 30 2021 february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 as fiscal 2020 fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 respectively 

effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

the united states and other countries are experiencing an ongoing major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 that started at the beginning of 2020 governmental authorities in affected regions have taken and continue to take dramatic actions in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease like other retailers across the country we temporarily closed all our store locations our distribution centers and our buying and corporate offices for a significant part of our first and second fiscal quarters we also instituted “work from home” measures for many of our associates our closures took effect march 20 2020 

all our distribution centers were reopened by the end of may 2020 the vast majority of our store locations were open and operating by the end of june 2020 and remained open throughout the remainder of fiscal 2020 while open many of our stores were operating on shorter hours and under mandated occupancy restrictions for periods of time as compared to the prior year 

the covid19 pandemic and the related economic disruption had a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows for fiscal 2020 the consolidated results presented in this report reflect the significant revenue decline and other impacts from our temporary store closures for approximately half of the first quarter and 25 percent of the second quarter mandated occupancy restrictions and reduced operating hours our core business results improved during the second half of fiscal 2020 however upsurges of covid19 in the fourth quarter especially in california our largest state resulted in reduced customer traffic and slowed the pace of recovery while vaccines have become available and a steadily increasing portion of the us population is being vaccinated it will take time for those efforts to reach levels that permit a relaxation of the social distancing restrictions we expect the material adverse effects from the pandemic to continue through fiscal 2021 and potentially beyond 

the temporary closure of all our stores during much of the first two fiscal quarters significantly impacted our ability to sell the seasonal inventory then on hand in a timely manner as we reopened our stores and resumed operations in the middle of the second quarter a significant portion of the merchandise in our stores was aged and out of season we took deep markdowns to sell through this inventory during the initial reopenings sales were ahead of our conservative plans as we benefited from pentup consumer demand and aggressive markdowns in the weeks after reopening sales trends were negatively affected by depleted store inventory levels while we were ramping up our buying and distribution capabilities during the third quarter sales improved substantially compared to the second quarter this was driven by several factors including an improvement in our merchandise assortm ents a 

later backtoschool season stronger performance in our larger markets and our return to more normal store hours our fourth quarter sales remained suppressed due to the negative impact from the upsurge in the virus that resulted in reduced customer traffic and more stringent occupancy and store operating hours restrictions 

the ongoing effect of the covid19 pandemic on consumer behavior and spending patterns remains highly uncertain despite the initial surge in customer demand as our stores first reopened we expect customer demand to be generally suppressed for an extended period of time in addition there have been recent resurgences in the spread of covid19 and new virus variants throughout the united states which may also recur in the future in one or more regions and which have and could require our stores and distribution centers to temporarily close again nationally regionally or in specific locations these closures would negatively impact our future revenue and operations 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we incurred various costs to reopen our stores and distribution centers and we incurred additional operating costs for processes and procedures to facilitate social distancing to enhance cleaning and sanitation activities and to provide personal protective equipment to our associates these actions combined with various other actions taken to reduce costs resulted in approximately 130 million of additional net costs in fiscal 2020  we expect our operating costs to remain elevated related to our continuing response to the covid19 pandemic 

to preserve our financial liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility we borrowed 800 million from our revolving credit facility in march 2020 completed a 20 billion senior notes offering in april 2020 and entered into a new 500 million 364day senior revolving credit facility in may 2020 in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we refinanced 775 million in aggregate principal amount of higher interest senior notes with the issuance of 10 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes this action resulted in a refinancing charge of approximately 240 million in the third quarter but will significantly reduce our annual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt in addition to refinancing the senior notes we took several other actions during the third quarter to reduce our ongoing debt costs including repayment of the 800 million revolving credit facility and termination of the undrawn 500 million 364day senior revolving credit facility 

we suspended our stock repurchase program in march 2020 and temporarily suspended quarterly dividends in may 2020 and we took measures to reduce our expenses inventory receipts and capital expenditures beginning april 5 2020 we implemented temporary furloughs for a large portion of our hourly store and distribution center and other associates in our buying and corporate offices who could not work productively while our stores and distribution centers were closed employee health benefits for eligible associates continued during the temporary furlough at no cost to the impacted associates we also reduced payroll expenses through temporary salary reductions for senior executives and other personnel which remained in effect until may 24 2020 when more than half of our stores had reopened in conjunction with these payroll expense reduction measures effective april 1 2020 the nonemployee members of our board of directors suspended the cash elements of their director compensation which remained in effect until august 2020 

in may 2020 in connection with the phased reopening of our store and distribution center locations we began recalling many of our furloughed associates as they were able to resume productive work as of our third quarter the majority of these associates had returned to work 

also in may 2020 we suspended rent payments associated with the leases for our temporarily closed stores during fiscal 2020 we negotiated rent deferrals andor rent abatements for a significant number of our stores the repayment of the deferrals will be at later dates primarily in fiscal 2021 we have recorded accruals for rent payment deferrals and have recorded rent abatements as a reduction of variable lease costs 

given the unprecedented impact the covid19 pandemic has had on our business and the continued uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic including its unknown duration and future severity the potential for resurgences and new virus variants and the unknown overall impact on consumer demand and store productivity we expect that impacts from the covid19 pandemic and the related cost increases and economic disruption may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows in fiscal 2021 and pote ntially beyond 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 



stores total stores open at the end of fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 were 1859 1805 and 1717 respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 increased by 3 5 and 6 from the respective prior years in response to the impacts from the covid19 pandemic we reduced our pace of new store openings for fiscal 2020 our longer term strategy is to open additional stor es based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2020 decreased 35 billion or 219 compared to the prior year this was primarily due to the negative impact from store closures during the march 2020 to june 2020 period the negative impact on customer demand from the covid19 pandemic mandated occupancy restrictions and reduced store operating hours during the remainder of fiscal 2020 we opened 54 net new stores during 2020 the sales from these new stores partially offset the overall sales decline 

sales for fiscal 2019 increased 11 billion or 70 compared to the prior year due to the opening of 88 net new stores during 2019 and a 3 increase in sales from comparable stores 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 



we intend to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our merchant organization diversify our merchandise mix and more fully develop our systems to improve our merchandise offerings 

our historic strategies and store expansion program have contributed to our sales gains in the past however given the impacts from the covid19 pandemic on our results for fiscal 2020 and the significant ongoing impacts and uncertainties including the unknown overall impact on consumer demand and shopping behavior the unknown duration of the pandemic and potential responses to it which may require stores and distribution centers to close again nationally regionally or in specific locations we cannot be sure that our strategies and resumption of our store expansion program will result in a continuation of our historical sales growth or in a recovery of or an increase in net earnings 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2020 decreased 17 billion compared to the prior year mainly due to the lower sales from the temporary closure of all store locations starting on march 20 2020 through a portion of the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and ensuing negative impact on customer demand from the covid19 pandemic after our store reopenings as well as lower costs from the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our distribution centers and some associates in our buying offices these decreases were partially offset by higher markdowns used to clear aged and seasonal inventory higher distribution costs primarily due to increased wages and higher freight costs due to industrywide supply chain congestion added expenditures for covid19 related measures and higher occupancy costs from the opening of 54 net new stores during 2020 as we enter 2021 we expect higher supply chain costs from the industrywide congestion to continue through fiscal 2021 along with higher costs from increases in wages we implemented in the second half of 2020 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2019 increased 8099 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 88 net new stores during the year and a 3 increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 increased approximately 35 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in distribution expenses and a 15 basis point increase in freight costs these increases were partially offset by a 10 basis point improvement in merchandise gross margin and a five basis point reduction in buying costs 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 1466 million compared to the prior year primarily due to approximately 240 million in longterm debt refinancing costs covidrelated expenses including for supplies cleaning and payroll related to additional safety protocols and payments to associates while our stores were closed net of employee retention credits under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” partially offset by payrollrelated cost reduction measures in response to the covid19 pandemic including the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our stores during closure periods and some associates in our corporate offices reductions in nonbusiness critical operating expenses and lower store operating expenses on lower sales as we enter 2021 we expect our operating costs to continue to reflect ongoing covidrelated expenses and also higher wages 

for fiscal 2019 sga increased 1402 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 88 net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage on higher sales 

interest expense income net in fiscal 2020 net interest expense increased by 1015 million compared to 2019 primarily due to higher interest expense on longterm debt due to the issuance of senior notes in april 2020 and october 2020 net of repurchase of senior notes lower interest income due to lower interest rates and higher interest expense on shortterm debt due to the draw down on our 800 million revolving credit facility in march 2020 which was subsequently repaid in october 2020 partially offset by higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our brookshire texas distribution center 

in fiscal 2019 net interest income improved by 79 million compared to 2018 primarily due to lower interest expense on longterm debt due to the repayment of the series a 638 unsecured senior notes in december 2018 and higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our brookshire texas distribution center 

the table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 



taxes on earnings our effective tax rates for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 were approximately 20 23 and 23 respectively the effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is impacted by changes in tax law and accounting guidance location of new stores level of earnings tax effects associated with sharebased compensation and the resolution of tax positions with various tax authorities 

in fiscal 2019 we resolved uncertain tax positions with a state tax authority as a result we recognized a tax benefit of approximately 100 million in the consolidated statement of earnings in fiscal 2018  we resolved uncertain tax positions related to fiscal 2015 with the internal revenue service as a result we recognized a tax benefit of approximately 260 million in the consolidated statement of earnings 

on march 27 2020 the cares act was signed into law the cares act made several significant changes to business tax provisions including modifications for net operating losses employee retention credits and deferral of employer payroll tax payments on december 27 2020 the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 “caa” was signed into law the caa made several changes to business tax provisions including increasing and extending the employee retention credits through june 30 2021 and extending certain employmentrelated tax credits through december 31 2025 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2020 were lower than in fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher cost of goods sold higher sga expenses and higher interest expense net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 were lower compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher cost of goods sold partially offset by lower sga expenses and higher interest income 

earnings per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was 024 compared to 460 in the prior year the lower diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to lower sales due to the closing of all our store locations starting on march 20 2020 through a portion the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the negative impact on customer demand from the covid19 pandemic higher markdowns to clear aged and seasonal inventory longterm debt refinancing costs payments to associates while our stores were closed net of employee retention credits under the cares act and higher expenditures for covid19 related measures 

diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 was 460 which included a per share benefit of approximately 002 primarily related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter compared to 426 in the prior year which included a per share benefit of approximately 007 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

as previously noted the united states and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 that started at the beginning of 2020 governmental authorities in affected regions have taken and continue to take dramatic actions in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease similar to other retailers across the country we temporarily closed all store locations our distribution centers and our buying and corporate offices effective march 20 2020 through may 14 2020 when we began a phased process of resuming operations all our distribution centers were reopened by the end of may 2020 the vast majority of our store locations were open and operating by the end of june 2020 and remained open throughout the remainder of fiscal 2020 though many of our stores were operating on shorter hours and under mandated occupancy restrictions for periods of time compared to the prior year 

to preserve our financial liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility we borrowed 800 million from our revolving credit facility in march 2020 completed a 20 billion senior notes offering in april 2020 and entered into a new 500 million 364day senior revolving credit facility in may 2020 in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we refinanced 775 million in aggregate principal amount of higher interest senior notes with the issuance of 10 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes this action resulted in a refinancing charge of approximately 240 million in the third quarter but will significantly reduce our annual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt in addition to refinancing the senior notes refinancing we took several other actions during the third quarter to reduce our ongoing debt costs including repayment of the 800 million revolving credit facility and termination of the undrawn 500 million 364day senior revolving credit facility 

we suspended our stock repurchase program in march 2020 and temporarily suspended quarterly dividends in may 2020 a nd we took measures to reduce our expenses inventory receipts and capital expenditures beginning april 5 2020 we implemented temporary furloughs for a large portion of our hourly store and distribution center and other associates in our buying and corporate offices who could not work productively while our stores and distribution centers were closed employee health benefits for eligible associates continued during the temporary furlough at no cost to the impacted associates we also reduced payroll expenses through temporary salary reductions for senior executives and other personnel which remained in effect until may 24 2020 when more than half of our stores had reopened in conjunction with these payroll expense reduction measures effective april 1 2020 the nonemployee members of our board of directors suspended the cash elements of their director compensation which remained in effect until august 2020 

also in may 2020 we suspended rent payments associated with the leases for our temporarily closed stores during fiscal 2020 we negotiated rent deferrals andor rent abatements for a significant number of our stores the repayment of the deferrals will be at later dates primarily in fiscal 2021 we recorded accruals for rent payment deferrals and recorded rent abatements as a reduction of variable lease costs 

we ended fiscal 2020 with ove r 56 billion in liquidity which consists of 48 billion unrestricted cash balances and the 800 million available under our revolving credit facility 

historically our primary sources of funds for our business activities have been cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll operating and variable lease costs taxes and for capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores and investments in distribution centers information systems and buying and corporate offices we also use cash to pay dividends to repay debt as it becomes due and to repurchase stock under active stock repurchase programs 

due to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions and with the possibility that some of our stores distribution centers and other facilities may need to temporarily close again or continue on reduced operating hours andor capacity restrictions as a result of government mandates we anticipate potential interruptions to our cash flows from operations we anticipate that we will be required to rely more on our cash reserves and we expect to carefully monitor and manage our cash position in light of ongoing conditions and levels of operations 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 22 billion in fiscal 2020 this was primarily driven by higher accounts payable due to extended payment terms lower merchandise receipts as we closely managed inventory levels and used packaway inventory to replenish our stores and net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization this was partially offset by the lower net earnings due to lower sales from the temporary closing of all store locations starting on march 20 2020 through a portion of the second quarter and the negative impact on customer demand from the covid19 pandemic net cash provided by operating activities was 22 billion and 21 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization and for deferred taxes 

the increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by higher accounts payable leverage the increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by higher earnings and the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus the prior year accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory was 150 71 and 67 as of january 30 2021 february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively the increase in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by lower packaway and instore inventory and extended payment terms the increase in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus the prior year 

as a regular part of our business packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise purchase opportunities in the marketplace and our decisions on the timing for release of that inventory packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but in normal times and historically packaway remains in storage less than six months we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers 

changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow at the end of fiscal 2020 packaway inventory was 38 of total inventory compared to 46 at the end of both fiscal 2019 and 2018 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 4054 million 5550 million and 4104 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a reduction in our capital expenditures the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures 

the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to our actions to preserve our financial liquidity in response to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to investments in our distribution centers and information technology infrastructure investments for our stores buying corporate offices and transportation we opened 66 98 and 99 new stores in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 our capital expenditures were 4054 million 5555 million and 4139 million respectively our capital expenditures included costs to build expand and improve distribution centers primarily related to the ongoing construction of our brookshire texas distribution center open new stores and improve 

existing stores and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems buying and corporate offices 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 



capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are projected to be approximately 700 m illion our planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are expected to be used for continued construction of our brookshire texas distribution center costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open planned new ross and dd’s discounts stores investments in certain information technology systems and for various other needed expenditures related to our stores distribution centers buying and corporate offices we expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash the increase in our planned capital expenditures from fiscal 2020 are primarily driven by the continued construction of our brookshire texas distribution center and the resumption of certain projects that were deferred from fiscal 2020 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 17 billion in fiscal 2020 net cash used in financing activities was 17 billion and 15 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the completion of our public debt offerings net of repurchase and refinancing costs and the suspension of our share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of 2020 

in july 2019 we entered into a new 800 million unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced our previous 600 million unsecured revolving credit facility this current credit facility expires in july 2024 and contains a 300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit the facility also contains an option allowing us to increase the size of our revolving credit facility by up to an additional 300 million with the agreement of the lenders interest on borrowings under this facility is based on libor or an alternate benchmark rate if libor is no longer available plus an applicable margin and is payable quarterly and upon maturity the revolving credit facility may be extended at our option for up to two additional oneyear periods subject to customary conditions 

in march 2020 we borrowed 800 million under our revolving credit facility interest on the loan was based on libor plus 0875 or 176 

in may 2020 we amended the 800 million revolving credit facility the “amended credit facility” to temporarily suspend for the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020 the consolidated adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio financial covenant and to apply a transitional modification to that ratio effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the amended credit facility also established a new temporary minimum liquidity requirement effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and through the end of april 2021 as of january 30 2021  we were in compliance with these amended covenants 

in october 2020 we rep aid in full the 800 million we borrowed under the unsecured revolving credit facility as a result we currently have no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under this facility and the 800 million credit facility remains in place and available 

in may 2020 we also entered into an additional 500 million 364day senior revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in april 2021 in october 2020 we terminated this senior revolving credit facility we had no borrowings under that credit facility at any time 

in april 2020 we issued an aggregate of 20 billion in unsecured senior notes in four tenors as follows 700 million of 4600 senior notes due april 2025 400 million of 4700 senior notes due april 2027 400 million of 4800 senior notes due april 2030 and 500 million of 5450 senior notes due april 2050 

in october 2020 we accepted for purchase approximately 775 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes pursuant to cash tender offers as follows 351 million of the 2050 notes 266 million of the 2030 notes and 158 million of the 2027 notes we paid approximately 1003 billion in aggregate consideration including transaction costs and accrued and unpaid interest and recorded an approximately 240 million loss on the early extinguishment for the accepted notes 

in october 2020 we also issued an aggregate of 10 billion in unsecured senior notes in two tenors as follows 0875 senior notes due april 2026 the “ 2026 notes ”  with an aggregate principal amount of 500 million and 1875 senior notes due april 2031 the “ 2031 notes ”  with an aggregate principal amount of 500 million cash proceeds net of discounts and other issuance costs were approximately 9872 million we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2026 and 2031 notes to fund the purchase of the accepted notes from our tender offers 

in june 2020 we amended the covenants associated with the 65 million outstanding series b unsecured senior notes the amended covenants are consistent with the corresponding covenants in our existing revolving credit facility as of january 30 2021 we were in compliance with these covenants 

on december 13 2018 we repaid at maturity the 85 million principal amount of the series a 638 unsecured senior n otes 

in march 2019 our board of directors approved a twoyear 255 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2020 due to the economic uncertainty stemming from the severe impact of the covid19 pandemic we suspended our stock repurchase program in march 2020 at which time we had repurchased 1407 billion under the 255 billion stock repurchase program we do not plan on making additional purchases until further notice 

in february 2017 our board of directors approved a twoyear 175 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2018 in march 2018 our board of directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase authorization for fiscal 2018 by 200 million to 1075 billion up from the previously available 875 million 

we repurchased 12 million 123 million and 125 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 132 million 1275 million and 1075 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we also acquired 05 million 06 million and 07 million shares in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively of treasury stock from our employee stock equity compensation programs for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 452 million 607 million and 544 million during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

on march 2 2021 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0285 per common share payable on march 31 2021 resuming our payment of quarterly dividends our most recent prior quarterly dividend was a cash dividend of 0285 per common share declared by our board of directors in march 2020 in may 2020 we temporarily suspended our quarterly dividends due to the economic uncertainty stemming from the covid19 pandemic our board of directors declared cash dividends of 0255 per common share in march may august and november 2019 and cash dividends of 0225 per common share in march may august and november 2018 

during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 we paid dividends of 1014 million 3698 million and 3372 million respectively 

shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for our merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources due to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions we face added uncertainty about the levels of trade credit we can maintain and liquidity available from sales of merchandise 

during fiscal 2020 our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations and our longterm debt financing during fiscal 2019 and 2018 our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations 

the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions including the temporary closure of all of our store locations effective march 20 2020 through a portion of the second quarter continue to create significant uncertainty and challenges we believe that existing cash balances our bank credit facility and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs for at least the next 12 months 

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of january 30 2021 



other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above we do not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as of january 30 2021 

standby letters of credit and collateral trust we use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in addition to a funded trust to collateralize some of our insurance obligations we also use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility to collateralize some of our trade payable obligations as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 we had 153 million and 42 million respectively in standby letters of credit outstanding and 561 million and 560 million respectively in a collateral trust the standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists of restricted cash cash equivalents and investments 

trade letters of credit we had 163 million and 112 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 respectively 

effects of inflation or deflation we do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations 

other 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 

in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain descriptions of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

merchandise inventory our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weightedaverage basis or net realizable value we purchase inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to the company’s store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory accounted for approximately 38 46 and 46 of total inventories as of january 30 2021 february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

lease accounting as our leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate we use the estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets this rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the riskadjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and assumptions including credit rating credit spread and adjustments for the impact of collateral we believe that this is the rate we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term operating lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised we do not record a lease liability and corresponding rightofuse asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less and account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component our lease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost recorded on a straightline basis over the lease term 

prior to our adoption of accounting standards codification “asc” 842 in the beginning of fiscal 2019 when a lease contained “rent holidays” or required fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we recorded rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount was charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease was recorded as deferred rent we began recording rent expense on the lease possession date tenant improvement allowances were amortized over the lease term changes in deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances were included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

insurance obligations we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation general liability and employeerelated health care benefits our selfinsurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2020 and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation the rapidly developing challenges and our plans and responses to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions including adjustments to our operations planned new store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs plans and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future impact from the ongoing covid19 pandemic and other economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability operating conditions and growth remain difficult to predict our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations plans and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd’s discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of january 30 2021 

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 30 2021 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

as of january 30 2021 we have outstanding eight series of unsecured senior notes interest that is payable on all series of our senior notes is based on fixed interest rates and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates 

we receive interest on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended january 30 2021 we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible nearterm changes in interest rates to be material

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item our merchandise offerings include but are not limited to apparel including footwear and accessories small furniture home accents bed and bath beauty toys luggage gourmet food cookware jewelry and watches 

purchasing we have a combined network of about 7500 merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on purchases 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at great values or can be stored as packaway merchandise 

packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2019 we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 46 of total inventories as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 we believe the strong discounts we offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

our primary buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nation’s two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

at the end of fiscal 2019 we had approximately 900 merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct and each includes merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have on average seven years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdale’s burlington stores kohl’s lord  taylor macy’s saks and target we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in our merchant organization to further develop our relationships with our manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brand name merchandise that is priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on most of our price tags which display our selling price as well as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

as of february 1 2020 we operated a total of 1805 stores comprised of 1546 ross stores and 259 dd’s discounts stores our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit we cluster ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management we do the same for dd’s discounts stores 

we believe a key element of our success at both ross and dd’s discounts is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasurehunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers our stores have shopping carts andor baskets available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

we accept a variety of payment methods we provide refunds or store credit on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to do this are labor costs that are generally lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

information systems 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include continued enhancements to our information and data security merchandising distribution transportation store and financial systems these initiatives support future growth the execution and achievement of our plans as well as ongoing stability and compliance 

distribution 

we operate distribution processing facilities where we receive and ship all of our merchandise to our stores these distribution centers are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model an additional distribution center in brookshire texas is currently under construction and expected to open in 2021 we also operate warehouse facilities for packaway storage 

we utilize a combination of our own and thirdparty cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our distribution centers and warehouses with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing and storage capacity to support our current store growth information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

advertising 

advertising for ross dress for less relies primarily on television to communicate the ross value proposition—savings off the same brands carried at leading department or specialty stores every day this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position while television is our primary advertising medium we continue to grow additional channels including social and digital media to communicate our brand position advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on radio and new store grand openings 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross ®  ross dress for less ®  and dd’s discounts ® have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of february 1 2020 we had approximately 92500 total employees which includes both full and parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customers and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization we also continue to make improvements to our merchandising systems to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are wellpositioned to compete based on each of these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from online retailers department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2019 and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain forwardlooking statements with respect to anticipated future events including the rapidly developing challenges with and our plans and responses to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions our financial performance operations competitive position and our projected growth that are all subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and from our prior expectations and projections refer to management’s discussion and analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of “forwardlooking statements” 

our financial condition results of operations cash flows and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors risks and uncertainties that apply to both ross and dd’s discounts include without limitation the following 

the current major health pandemic from the novel coronavirus covid19 is severely and adversely affecting our sales and our operations and will have serious adverse effects on our business and our financial condition 

the united states and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 and related severe disruptions to retail operations and supply chains and to general economic activities as the affected regions take increasingly dramatic action in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease as the covid19 pandemic continues many of our customers are impacted by recommendations andor mandates from federal state and local authorities to stay home shelter in place or safer at home and to avoid nonessential social contact and gatherings of people and to selfquarantine in recent weeks starting in march 2020 we have experienced a broadbased deceleration in sales trends from consumer response to the covid19 pandemic throughout the country governmental authorities in affected regions are taking increasingly dramatic action in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease as part of a growing number of retailers across the country we have temporarily closed all store locations effective march 20 2020 through april 3 2020 we have closed our buying and corporate offices and our distribution centers for the same period and we have instituted “work from home” measures for many of our associates we are monitoring the situation and will reopen stores as conditions permit however extended or further closures may be required nationally regionally or in specific locations the situation is unprecedented and rapidly changing and has unknown duration and severity this significant reduction in customer visits to our stores will result in a loss of sales and profits and have material adverse effects to our financial condition in addition the covid19 pandemic will potentially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff our stores and our distribution merchant and other support operations further the covid19 pandemic is currently severely impacting china and other countries which may also adversely affect our ability to access and ship products from the impacted countries a prolonged widespread pandemic will adversely impact global economies and financial markets which will result in an economic downturn that will reduce demand for our products the extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the us the response by all levels of government in their efforts to contain the outbreak and to mitigate the economic disruptions and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted such impacts are expected to adversely affect our profitability cash flows financial results and our capital resources 

competitive pressures in the apparel and homerelated merchandise retailing industry are high 

the retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store and online formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector we compete for customers associates store locations and merchandise with many other local regional and national retailers traditional department stores upscale mass merchandisers other offprice retailers specialty stores internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing business strategies and promotional activity particularly during holiday periods in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition the substantial sales growth in ecommerce within the last decade has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors new business models and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online shopping alternatives intense pressures from our competitors our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape or a failure to effectively execute our offprice model could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause us to take greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins 

unexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and homerelated merchandise could adversely affect us 

our success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand we work on an ongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer needs it is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the multiple markets in which we operate throughout the united states and its territories although our offprice business model provides us certain advantages and may allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers have in adjusting our merchandise mix to everchanging consumer tastes our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer trends and preferences particularly in our newer geographic markets failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends preferences and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

adverse andor unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and other merchandise and may result in temporary store closures and disruptions in deliveries of merchandise to our stores 

unseasonable weather and prolonged extreme temperatures as well as events such as storms affect consumers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop and may adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise among other things weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or require us to close certain stores temporarily thereby reducing store traffic even if stores are not closed many customers may be unable to go or may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather as a result adverse or unseasonable weather in any of our markets could lead to disappointing sales and cause us to increase our markdowns which may negatively affect our sales and margins 

we are subject to impacts from the macroeconomic environment financial and credit markets and geopolitical conditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income 

consumer spending habits for the merchandise we sell are affected by many factors including the reaction and repercussions from the covid19 pandemic prevailing economic conditions recession and fears of recession levels of unemployment salaries and wage rates housing costs energy and fuel costs income tax rates and the timing of tax refunds inflation consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer perceptions of personal wellbeing and security availability of consumer credit consumer debt levels and consumers’ disposable income the covid19 pandemic or other potential adverse developments in any of these areas could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins all of our stores are located in the united states and its territories so we are especially susceptible to changes in the us economy   

in order to achieve our planned gross margins we must effectively manage our inventories markdowns and inventory shortage 

we purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans if our actual demand is lower than our sales plans we may experience excess inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory resulting in decreased profit margins we also may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales opportunities as a regular part of our business we purchase “packaway” inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores varies by merchandise category and by season but it typically remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory if we make packaway purchases that 

do not align with consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores we could have significant inventory markdowns changes in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow although we have various systems to help protect against loss or theft of our inventory both when in storage and once distributed to our stores we may have damaged lost or stolen inventory called “shortage” in higher amounts than we forecast which would result in writeoffs lost sales and reduced margins 

we depend on the market availability quantity and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices 

opportunistic buying lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our offprice business strategy maintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is also key to our ability to attract customers and sustain our sales and gross margins our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with our merchants who are in the marketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season our ability to meet or exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that we can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers to the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced to the extent that certain of our vendors decide not to sell to us or go out of business the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could also be materially reduced because a significant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries changes in us tariffs trade relationships or tax policies and natural disasters or public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of imported goods could also result in disruptions to our existing supply relationships shortages or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality valuepriced merchandise would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and margins 

information or data security breaches including cyberattacks on our transaction processing and computer information systems could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of customer credit card employee or other private and valuable information that we handle in the ordinary course of our business disrupt our operations damage our reputation and increase our costs 

like other large retailers we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process transmit and store payment card and other personal and confidential information and to provide information or data security for those transactions some of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check approvals and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards are controlled by the banking and payment card industry not by us cyber criminals may attempt to penetrate our point of sale and other information systems to misappropriate customer or business information including but not limited to creditdebit card personnel or trade information despite security measures we have in place and our efforts to prevent monitor and mitigate attacks and errors our facilities and systems or those of thirdparty service providers we utilize or connect to may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors phishing and similar fraudulent attacks or other similar events it is also possible that an associate within our company or a third party we do business with may purposefully or inadvertently cause a security breach involving such information the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and advances in computer capabilities and remote access increases these risks a breach of our information or data security a system shut down or other response we may take or our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a loss of personal or business information could result in damage to our reputation loss of customer confidence violation or alleged violation of applicable laws and expose us to civil claims litigation and regulatory action and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations 

disruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver product to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner 

various information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business we depend on the integrity continuous availability and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores track inventory flow manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics generate performance and financial reports and support merchandising decisions 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace information processes and systems that are key to managing our business we must monitor and choose sound investments and implement them at the right pace the risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken an excessive rate of technological change could detract from the effectiveness of 

adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from new technology poorly targeting opportunities failing to make good investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could damage our competitive position and adversely impact our business and results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system changes could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide us with the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

our information systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as severe storms fires earthquakes floods acts of terrorism and design or usage errors by our employees or by third parties if our information systems or our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport merchandise to our stores or our distribution centers which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or increased supply chain costs such disruptions may result from public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters trade restrictions tariffs thirdparty strikes or ineffective cross dock operations work stoppages or slowdowns shipping capacity constraints supply or shipping interruptions or other factors beyond our control any such disruptions could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

we need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth 

successful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas we compete with other retailers and businesses for acceptable store locations for the purpose of identifying locations we rely in part on consumer demographics while we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations we recognize that this information cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy time frames for negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected cancellations we may not be able to open new stores or if opened operate those new stores profitably construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results additionally we may not be able to renegotiate our current lease terms which could negatively impact our operating results new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability of other existing stores if we cannot acquire sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the economics of our new stores in various markets 

to achieve growth we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets 

our growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our offprice model in current markets and in new geographic regions there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets stores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction occupancy advertising or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets thereby affecting our overall profitability new markets may have competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may require us to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and retain qualified associates 

consumer problems or legal issues involving the quality safety or authenticity of products we sell could harm our reputation result in lost sales andor increase our costs 

various governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell these regulations and related laws frequently change and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated because of our opportunistic buying strategy we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors that we have not dealt with before although our vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally rely on our vendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable product safety and other laws vendor noncompliance with 

consumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls make certain products unsalable or require us to incur significant compliance costs 

regardless of fault any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we offer particularly products such as food and children’s items issues with the authenticity of merchandise or our inability or that of our vendors to comply on a timely basis with laws and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our reputation result in lost sales inventory writeoffs uninsured product liability or other legal claims penalties or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs 

an adverse outcome in various legal regulatory or tax matters could damage our reputation or brand and increase our costs 

as an ordinary part of our business we are involved in various legal proceedings regulatory reviews tax audits or other legal matters these may include lawsuits inquiries demands or other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and private plaintiffs including those relating to employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination harassment wage and hour and retaliation securities real estate tort commercial consumer protection privacy product compliance and safety advertising comparative pricing intellectual property tax escheat and whistleblower claims we continue to be involved in a number of employmentrelated lawsuits including classrepresentative actions which are primarily in california 

we are subject to federal state and local rules and regulations in the united states and to various international laws which change from time to time these legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business including the cost of health care workforce management and employee benefits minimum wages advertising comparative pricing importexport sourcing and manufacturing data protection intellectual property and others if we fail to comply or are alleged not to comply with any of these requirements we may be subject to fines settlements penalties or other costs in addition an adverse outcome or the adverse publicity from the claims in any of these matters may damage our reputation or brand we are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state and local tax authorities and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take 

significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax provisions and reserves for legal claims actual results may differ and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes in addition applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and those changes could have material effects on our reported operating results and financial condition 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

our reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry such an incident could also include alleged acts or omissions by or situations involving our suppliers or their contractors or subcontractors the landlord for our stores or our associates outside of work and may pertain to social or political issues or protests largely unrelated to our business the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons continues to increase the availability of information whether correct or erroneous on social media platforms is virtually immediate as is its impact many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content the opportunity for dissemination of information including inaccurate information is seemingly limitless and readily available information concerning our company may be posted on such platforms at any time information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate which could negatively affect our sales diminish customer trust reduce employee morale and productivity and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified associates the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction   

our inability to continually attract train and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our offprice retail strategies along with labor shortages increased turnover or increased labor costs could adversely affect our operating results 

like other retailers we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization management stores distribution centers and other key areas many of our retail store associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or healthcare benefits 

any increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or if we fail to pay such higher wages may result in increased turnover excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding hiring and training new associates if we cannot hire enough qualified associates or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from thirdparty providers especially during our peak seasons our operations could be negatively impacted 

because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must also attract train and retain our key associates across the company especially within our buying organization the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our growth operations or financial position 

we must effectively advertise and market our business 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of our stores although we use marketing and advertising programs to attract customers to our stores particularly through television our competitors may spend more or use different approaches which could provide them with a competitive advantage our advertising and other promotional programs may not be effective or may be perceived negatively or could require increased expenditures any of which could adversely affect sales or increase costs 

we are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries 

risks in importing and selling such merchandise include import duties and quotas compliance with antidumping regulations economic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions including inflation recession and exchange rate fluctuations foreign government regulations employment and labor matters concerns relating to human rights working conditions and other issues in factories or countries where merchandise is produced transparency of sourcing and supply chains exposure on product warranty and intellectual property issues consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise wars and fears of war political unrest natural disasters regulations to address climate change and trade restrictions 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell even when we purchase it domestically often as excess inventory sold to us by a domestic vendor is originally manufactured in other countries in addition we directly source a portion of the products sold in our stores from foreign vendors predominantly in asia including china we also buy products that originate from foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors and manufacturers’ representatives although our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors when we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer 

to the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products any event causing a disruption of imports including the imposition of import restrictions war acts of terrorism natural disasters or public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics could adversely affect our business the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas or both applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us we cannot predict whether any of the countries from which our products are sourced or in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments or the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions 

we require our vendors for both import and domestic purchasing to contractually confirm that they adhere to various conduct compliance and other requirements including those relating to environmental employment and labor including wages and working conditions health safety and antibribery standards from time to time our vendors their contractors or their subcontractors may be alleged to not be in compliance with these standards or with applicable local laws although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise and to monitor our suppliers this does not guarantee that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation could subject us to claims and liability and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in us tax or trade policy regarding apparel and homerelated merchandise produced in other countries could adversely affect our business 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries the us government has at times indicated a willingness to significantly change existing trade policies including those with china this exposes us to risks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise and creates increased uncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins changes in us tariffs quotas trade relationships or tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost of goods andor increase our effective tax rate although such changes would have implications across the entire industry we may fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes in addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in us laws and policies as we make business decisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes miss out on business opportunities or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes these risks could adversely affect our revenues and expenses increase our effective tax rates and reduce our profitability 

we may experience volatility in revenues and earnings 

our business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and backtoschool seasons weather and other factors although our offprice business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers we may still experience unexpected decreases in sales from time to time which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins significant operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not adjust proportionately with our sales if sales in a certain period are lower than our plans we may not be able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently which could adversely affect our operating results 

a pandemic natural or manmade disaster in california or in another region where we have a concentration of stores offices or a distribution center could harm our business 

our corporate headquarters los angeles buying office nine distribution centerswarehouses and approximately 23 of our stores are located in california natural or other disasters such as the current covid19 pandemic or other future pandemics earthquakes and hurricanes tornadoes floods or other extreme weather and climate conditions or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism or public health issues in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain or could shut down damage or destroy our stores or distribution facilities at the time of this filing more than 40 million residents in california are under governmental orders to stay at home “shelter in place” or “safer at home” and to avoid nonessential social contact and gatherings of people the duration of this situation is unknown and it is severely and adversely affecting our sales and our financial results 

to support our continuing operations our new store and distribution center growth plans our quarterly dividends and any resumption of our stock repurchase program we must maintain sufficient liquidity the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruption are adding significant uncertainty and challenges 

we depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities and to supply capital to finance our operations make capital expenditures and acquisitions manage our debt levels and return value to our stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases in recent weeks starting in march 2020 we have experienced a broadbased deceleration in sales trends from consumer response to the covid19 pandemic throughout the country governmental authorities in affected regions are taking increasingly dramatic action in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease as part of a growing number of retailers across the country we have temporarily closed all store locations effective march 20 2020 through april 3 2020 we have closed our buying and corporate offices and our distribution centers for the same period and we have instituted “work from home” measures for many of our associates we are monitoring the situation and will reopen stores as conditions permit however extended or further closures may be required nationally regionally or in specific locations the situation is unprecedented and rapidly changing and has unknown duration and severity if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support our activities our growth plans and our financial performance would be adversely affected we have already temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program if necessary to support our operations we could be forced to discontinue payment of our quarterly cash dividends the failure to repurchase stock and any failure to pay dividends may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively affect our stock price 

we have borrowed on occasion to finance some of our activities in march 2020 we borrowed 800 million from our revolving credit facility to add to our cash balances in order to provide enhanced financial flexibility due to uncertain market conditions arising from the impact of the covid19 pandemic if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns our operations cash flows and returns to stockholders could be adversely affected

 item 2 properties 

at february 1 2020 we operated a total of 1805 stores of which 1546 were ross stores in 39 states the district of columbia and guam and 259 were dd’s discounts stores in 19 states all stores are leased with the exception of two locations which we own 

during fiscal 2019 we opened 74 new ross stores and closed eight existing stores the average approximate ross store size is 28000 square feet 

during fiscal 2019 we opened 24 new dd’s discounts stores closed one existing store and temporarily closed one store impacted by a weather event the average approximate dd’s discounts store size is 23000 square feet 

during fiscal 2019 no one store accounted for more than 1 of our sales 

we carry fire flood wind and earthquake insurance to help mitigate the risk of financial loss that may result from such events 

our real estate strategy in 2020 is to primarily open stores in states where we currently operate to increase our market penetration and leverage overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market we also expect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in 2020 important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the local trade area in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

the following table summarizes the locations of our stores by stateterritory as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 



where possible we obtain sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations allowing us to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time at reasonable costs in a given market at february 1 2020 the majority of our stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years with three to four renewal options of five years each the average unexpired original lease term of our leased stores is approximately six years or approximately 20 years if renewal options are included see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 3 legal proceedings 

like many retailers we have been named in classrepresentative action lawsuits primarily in california alleging violation of wage and hour laws and consumer protection laws classrepresentative action litigation remains pending as of february 1 2020

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

ross stores inc operates two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion stores—ross dress for less ® “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1546 locations in 39 states the district of columbia and guam as of february 1 2020 ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices every day we also operate 259 dd’s discounts stores in 19 states as of february 1 2020 that feature a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry and believe our share gains over the past few years were driven mainly by continued focus on value by consumers our sales and earnings gains in 2019 continued to benefit from efficient execution of our offprice model throughout all areas of our business our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 1 2020 february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 as fiscal 2019 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 respectively fiscal 2017 was a 53week year fiscal 2019 and 2018 were each 52week years 

current material development – the covid19 pandemic is disrupting our business 

the united states and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 governmental authorities in affected regions are taking increasingly dramatic action in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease as part of a growing number of retailers across the country we have temporarily closed all store locations effective march 20 2020 through april 3 2020 we have closed our buying and corporate offices and our distribution centers for the same period and we have instituted “work from home” measures for many of our associates we are monitoring the situation and will reopen stores as conditions permit however extended or further closures may be required nationally regionally or in specific locations given the unprecedented uncertainty of this situation including the unknown duration and severity of the pandemic and the unknown overall impact on consumer demand we are unable to forecast the full impact on our business however we now expect that impacts from the covid19 pandemic and the related economic disruption will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations consolidated financial position and consolidated cash flows in fiscal 2020 

to preserve our financial liquidity and out of an abundance of caution we are temporarily suspending our stock repurchase program and in midmarch 2020 we borrowed 800 million from our revolving credit facility which bears interest at libor plus 075 currently 161 to add to our cash balances in addition we are reducing our expense inventory receipts and capital expenditure plans 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 



stores total stores open at the end of fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 were 1805 1717 and 1622 respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 increased by 5 6 and 6 from the respective prior years our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2019 increased 11 billion or 70 compared to the prior year due to the opening of 88 net new stores during 2019 and a 3 increase in comparable store sales defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2018 increased 08 billion or 60 compared to the prior year due to the opening of 95 net new stores during 2018 and a 4 increase in sales from comparable stores 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 



we intend to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our merchant organization diversify our merchandise mix and more fully develop our systems to improve our merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings 

as part of a growing number of retailers across the country we have temporarily closed all store locations effective march 20 2020 through april 3 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic we have closed our buying and corporate offices and our distribution centers for the same period and we have instituted “work from home” measures for many of our associates given the unprecedented uncertainty of this situation including the unknown duration and severity of the pandemic which may require extended and further store closures nationally regionally or in specific locations and the unknown overall impact on consumer demand we are unable to forecast the full impact on our business however we now expect that impacts from the covid19 pandemic and the related economic disruption will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations consolidated financial position and consolidated cash flows in fiscal 2020 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2019 increased 8099 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 88 net new stores during the year and a 3 increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 increased approximately 35 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in distribution expenses and a 15 basis point increase in freight costs these increases were partially offset by a 10 basis point improvement in merchandise gross margin and a five basis point reduction in buying costs 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2018 increased 6836 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 95 net new stores during the year and a 4 increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2018 increased approximately 55 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 40 basis point increase in freight costs a 15 basis point increase in distribution expenses higher buying costs of 10 basis points and higher occupancy costs of five basis points these increases were partially offset by an increase of 15 basis points in merchandise gross margin 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 1402 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 88 net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage on higher sales 

for fiscal 2018 sga increased 1729 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 95 net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2018 increased by approximately 30 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to higher wages 

interest income expense net in fiscal 2019 net interest income improved by 79 million compared to 2018 primarily due to lower interest expense on longterm debt due to the repayment of the series a 638 unsecured senior notes in december 2018 and higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our brookshire texas distribution center in fiscal 2018 net interest income improved by 178 million compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in interest income and higher capitalized interest on information systems projects 

the table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 



taxes on earnings our effective tax rates for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 were approximately 23 23 and 33 respectively the effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is impacted by changes in tax law and accounting guidance location of new stores level of earnings tax effects associated with sharebased compensation and the resolution of tax positions with various tax authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 will be approximately 24 

in november 2019 we resolved uncertain tax positions with a state tax authority as a result we recognized a tax benefit of approximately 100 million in the consolidated statement of earnings in fiscal 2018 we resolved uncertain federal tax positions related to fiscal 2015 with the internal revenue service as a result we recognized a tax benefit of approximately 260 million in the consolidated statement of earnings 

in fiscal 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” or tax reform was signed into law the tax act made significant changes to us corporate taxation including reducing the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the last month of fiscal 2017 us gaap requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted we applied a us federal income tax rate of 21 for fiscal 2018 and a blended us federal income tax rate of approximately 34 for fiscal 2017 this reduced tax rate resulted in a benefit of 249 million in fiscal 2017 we recorded an additional tax benefit of 552 million due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in fiscal 2017 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 were lower than in fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher cost of goods sold partially offset by lower sga expenses and higher interest income net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2018 were higher compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower taxes as a result of tax reform and higher interest income partially offset by higher cost of goods sold and higher sga expenses 

earnings per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 was 460 which included a per share benefit of approximately 002 primarily related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter compared to 426 in the prior year which included a per share benefit of approximately 007 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter the 8 increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an increase of approximately 5 in net earnings and 3 from the reduction in weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018 was 426 which included a per share benefit of approximately 070 from tax reform and 007 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter compared to 355 in the prior year which included a per share benefit of approximately 021 from tax reform and a 010 benefit from the 53rd week the 20 increase in diluted earnings per share was attributable to an increase of approximately 16 in net earnings which included a 14 impact from tax reform and a 2 impact from the favorable resolution of a tax matter and 4 from the reduction in weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

as previously noted the united states and other countries are experiencing the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions governmental authorities in affected regions are taking increasingly dramatic action in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease as part of a growing number of retailers across the country we have temporarily closed all store locations effective march 20 2020 through april 3 2020 we have closed our buying and corporate offices and our distribution centers for the same period and we have instituted “work from home” measures for many of our associates we are monitoring the situation and will reopen stores as conditions permit however extended or further closures may be required nationally regionally or in specific locations given the unprecedented uncertainty of this situation including the unknown duration and severity of the pandemic and the overall impact on consumer demand we are unable to forecast the full impact on our business however this represents a known area of uncertainty and we now expect that impacts from the covid19 pandemic and the related economic disruption will have a material adverse impact on our business this uncertainty includes the potential need for significant additional capital resources to maintain our operations during a period of declining revenue from sales we began fiscal 2020 with 14 billion in cash and cash equivalents to preserve our financial liquidity we are temporarily suspending our stock repurchase program and in midmarch 2020 we borrowed 800 million from our revolving credit facility which bears interest at libor plus 075 currently 161 to add to our cash balances in addition we are reducing our expense inventory receipts and capital expenditure plans we plan to continue to monitor the rapidly developing situation and to take further action to reduce our expenses and preserve our financial flexibility as necessary 

in normal times and historically our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll operating and variable lease costs taxes and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores and investments in distribution centers information systems and buying and corporate offices we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends and we may use cash for the repayment of debt as it becomes due due to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions and with the temporary closure of all store locations effective march 20 2020 through april 3 2020 and with extended or further closures possibly necessary we anticipate that we will be required to rely far more heavily on our cash reserves and lines of credit and we expect to carefully monitor and manage our cash position in light of ongoing conditions and levels of operations 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 21715 million 20667 million and 16813 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization and for deferred taxes our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns 

the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by higher earnings and the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year resulted in accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory of 71 67 and 65 as of february 1 2020 february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 respectively 

the increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by higher earnings the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year and lower income tax payments 

as a regular part of our business packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise purchase opportunities in the marketplace packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but in normal times and historically packaway remains in storage less than six months we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers 

changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow at the end of fiscal 2019 packaway inventory was 46 of total inventory compared to 46 and 49 at the end of fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 5550 million 4104 million and 3548 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures 

in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 our capital expenditures were 5555 million 4139 million and 3714 million respectively our capital expenditures include costs to build expand and improve distribution centers open new stores and improve existing stores and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems buying and corporate offices the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to investments in our distribution centers and information technology infrastructure investments for our stores buying corporate offices and transportation the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to investments in our distribution centers and information technology infrastructure investments for our stores buying corporate offices and transportation we opened 98 99 and 96 new stores in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

in november 2017 we entered into a saleleaseback transaction for one of our previously owned stores and received net cash proceeds of 160 million recognized a gain on sale of 63 million and deferred the residual 75 million gain over the remaining tenyear lease term as of february 3 2019 the effective date of the adoption of financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201602 leases accounting standards codification asc 842 we wroteoff the remaining 65 million deferred gain on the saleleaseback transaction that met the sale definition under asc 842 to beginning retained earnings 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 



as previously noted due to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions and to preserve our financial liquidity we are reviewing and reducing our capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2020 our capital expenditures would be to fund commitments related to the construction of our brookshire texas distribution center costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open planned new ross and dd’s discounts stores investments in certain information technology systems and for various other needed expenditures related to our stores distribution centers buying and corporate offices we expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash including cash we obtained by drawing from our revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 16832 million 15315 million and 11494 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively during fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations 

in march 2019 our board of directors approved a twoyear 255 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2020 as of the end of fiscal 2019 we have 1275 billion remaining under the stock repurchase program due to the current economic uncertainty stemming from the severe impact of the covid19 pandemic we are temporarily suspending our stock repurchase program 

in february 2017 our board of directors approved a twoyear 175 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2018 in march 2018 our board of directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase authorization for fiscal 2018 by 200 million to 1075 billion up from the previously available 875 million 

we repurchased 123 million 125 million and 135 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 1275 million 1075 million and 875 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we also acquired 06 million 07 million and 07 million shares in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively of treasury stock from our employee stock equity compensation programs for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 607 million 544 million and 454 million during fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

on march 3 2020 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0285 per common share payable on march 31 2020 our board of directors declared cash dividends of 0255 per common share in march may august and november 2019 cash dividends of 0225 per common share in march may august and november 2018 and cash dividends of 0160 per common share in february may august and november 2017 

during fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 we paid dividends of 3698 million 3372 million and 2475 million respectively 

on december 13 2018 we repaid at maturity the 85 million principal amount of the series a 638 unsecured senior notes 

shortterm trade credit normally represents a significant source of financing for our merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources due to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions we face uncertainty about the levels of trade credit we can maintain and liquidity available from sales of merchandise as noted below we have drawn from our available bank lines to add to our current cash balance 

in july 2019 we entered into a new 800 million unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced our previous 600 million unsecured revolving credit facility this new credit facility expires in july 2024 and contains a 300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit the facility also contains an option allowing us to increase the size of our revolving credit facility by up to an additional 300 million with the agreement of the lenders interest on borrowings under this facility is based on libor or an alternate benchmark rate if libor is no longer available plus an applicable margin currently 75 basis points and is payable quarterly and upon maturity the revolving credit facility may be extended at our option for up to two additional oneyear periods subject to customary conditions as of february 1 2020 we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding on this facility and our 800 million credit facility remained in place and available 

subsequent to year end in march 2020 we borrowed 800 million from our revolving credit facility which bears interest at libor plus 075 currently 161 to add to our cash balances in order to provide enhanced financial flexibility due to uncertain market conditions arising from the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the revolving credit facility is subject to a financial leverage ratio covenant as of february 1 2020 we were in compliance with this covenant 

the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions including the temporary closure of all of our store locations effective march 20 2020 through april 3 2020 and with extended or further closures possibly necessary are creating significant uncertainty and challenges we believe that existing cash balances cash flows 

from operations bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet our nearterm operating cash needs and capital investments further prolonged and extensive temporary store closures may require access to additional corporate credit markets 

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of february 1 2020 



other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above we do not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as of february 1 2020 

senior notes as of february 1 2020 we had outstanding unsecured 3375 senior notes due september 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of 250 million interest on the 2024 notes is payable semiannually 

as of february 1 2020 we also had outstanding series b unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of 65 million held by various institutional investors the series b notes are due in december 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 653 borrowings under these senior notes are subject to certain financial covenants including interest coverage and other financial ratios as of february 1 2020 we were in compliance with those covenants 

the 2024 notes and series b senior notes are subject to prepayment penalties for early payment of principal 

standby letters of credit and collateral trust we use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in addition to a funded trust to collateralize our insurance obligations as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 we had 42 million and 73 million respectively in standby letters of credit outstanding and 560 million and 583 million respectively in a collateral trust the standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists of restricted cash cash equivalents and investments 

trade letters of credit we had 112 million and 133 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively 

effects of inflation or deflation we do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 

in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain descriptions of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

merchandise inventory our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weightedaverage basis or net realizable value we purchase inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to the company’s store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory accounted for approximately 46 46 and 49 of total inventories as of february 1 2020 february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 respectively merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets we review our longlived assets for a potential impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group an impairment loss would be recognized to write the asset group down to its fair value if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future for stores that are closed we record an impairment charge if appropriate or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2019 2018 or 2017 

lease accounting as our leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate we use the estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets this rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the riskadjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and assumptions including credit rating credit spread and adjustments for the impact of collateral we believe that this is the rate we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term operating lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised we do not record a lease liability and corresponding rightofuse asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less and account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component our lease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost recorded on a straightline basis over the lease term 

prior to our adoption of accounting standards codification asc 842 in the beginning of fiscal 2019 when a lease contained “rent holidays” or required fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we recorded rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount was charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease was recorded as deferred rent we began recording 

rent expense on the lease possession date tenant improvement allowances were amortized over the lease term changes in deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances were included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows see recently adopted accounting standards below 

insurance obligations we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation general liability and employeerelated health care benefits our selfinsurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

income taxes we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740 we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures our policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 

recently issued accounting standards we consider the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates “asu” issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” asus not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial results 

recently adopted accounting standards in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases asc 842 which along with subsequent amendments supersedes the lease accounting requirements in asc 840 leases the updated guidance requires balance sheet recognition for all leases with lease terms greater than one year including a lease liability which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and a rightofuse asset that represents the lessee’s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term 

we adopted asc 842 as of february 3 2019 the effective date using the optional transition method on a modified retrospective basis we did not elect the transitional package of practical expedients or the use of hindsight upon adoption of the asc we elected to not record a lease liability and corresponding rightofuse asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less and to account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component upon adoption we recorded lease liabilities based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments using incremental borrowing rates as of the effective date of 29 billion and the corresponding rightofuse assets of 29 billion we also recorded a cumulativeeffect adjustment to decrease beginning retained earnings of 196 million primarily related to the writeoff of previously capitalized initial direct costs that are no longer capitalized under asc 842 partially offset by the writeoff of the deferred gain on a previous saleleaseback transaction that meets the sale definition under asc 842 reporting periods beginning on or after february 3 2019 are presented under asc 842 while prior period amounts and disclosures were not adjusted and continue to be reported under asc 840 adoption of asc 842 did not have a significant impact to the company’s consolidated statements of earnings or to the consolidated statements of cash flows 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 which along with subsequent amendments supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “revenue recognition asc 605” this guidance provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized and requires entities to recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services we adopted asc 606 as of february 4 2018 using the modified retrospective method results for reporting periods beginning on or after february 4 2018 are presented under asc 606 while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with asc 605 upon adoption of asc 606 we recorded a cumulativeeffect adjustment to increase beginning retained earnings by 20 million as of february 4 2018 primarily due to the change in the timing of the recognition of stored value card breakage the impact of applying asc 606 was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended february 2 2019 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230  restricted cash asu 201618 requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows the standard also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows we adopted asu 201618 as of february 4 2018 using the retrospective method 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  asu 201609 provides for changes to accounting for stock compensation including 1 excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to sharebased payment awards will be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the reporting period in which they occur previously such amounts were recognized in additional paidin capital 2 excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows and 3 the option to elect to estimate forfeitures or account for them when they occur the impact of recording excess tax benefits in income taxes in our consolidated statement of earnings may be material depending upon our future stock price on vest date in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date and our future grants of stockbased compensation 

we adopted asu 201609 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and elected to apply this adoption prospectively except for forfeitures which we adopted on a modified retrospective basis accordingly prior periods have not been adjusted as a result of adoption for the fiscal year ended february 3 2018 we recognized 163 million of excess tax benefits related to stockbased payments as a reduction to our provision for income taxes these items were historically recorded in additional paidin capital we also presented cash flows related to excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows and elected to account for forfeitures as incurred beginning on january 29 2017 the impact of this accounting policy election for forfeitures was a cumulativeeffect adjustment to decrease retained earnings by 11 million as of january 29 2017 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2019 and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation the rapidly developing challenges and our plans and responses to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd’s discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of february 1 2020 

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of february 1 2020 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

as of february 1 2020 we have one outstanding series of unsecured 653 series b senior notes due december 2021 with an aggregate principal amount of 65 million we also have unsecured 3375 senior notes due september 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of 250 million interest that is payable on our senior notes is based on fixed interest rates and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates 

we receive interest on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended february 1 2020 we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible nearterm changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion   stores—ross dress for less ®  “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  

ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1480  locations in 38 states the district of columbia and guam  as of february 2 2019  ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices every day ross’ target customers are primarily from middle income households 

we also operate 237  dd’s discounts stores in 18 states  as of february 2 2019  dd’s discounts features more moderatelypriced firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood and its target customers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than ross customers 

the merchant store field and distribution organizations for ross and dd’s discounts are separate and distinct the two chains share certain other corporate and support services 

both our ross and dd’s discounts brands target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are based on these customer profiles we believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

• maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store 

• meet customer needs on a local basis 

• deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer 

• manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 2 2019  february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  as fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  respectively fiscal 2017 was a 53week year fiscal 2018 and 2016 were each 52week years 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brand name and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices every day at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising which emphasizes a strong value message our stores offer a treasurehunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item our merchandise offerings include but are not limited to apparel including footwear and accessories small furniture home accents bed and bath beauty toys luggage gourmet food cookware and watches 

purchasing we have a combined network of about 8000  merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our six  distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on purchases 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at great values or can be stored as packaway merchandise 

packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2018  we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 46  and 49  of total inventories as of february 2 2019  and february 3 2018  respectively we believe the strong discounts we offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

our primary buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nation’s two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

at the end of fiscal 2018  we had approximately 850  merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct and each includes merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have on average seven  years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdale’s burlington stores foot locker kohl’s lord  taylor macy’s nordstrom saks and tjx we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in our merchant organization to further develop our relationships with our manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brand name merchandise that is priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on most of our price tags which display our selling price as well as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers 

consistently low prices and compelling value on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

as of february 2 2019  we operated a total of 1717  stores comprised of 1480  ross stores and 237  dd’s discounts stores our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit we cluster ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management we do the same for dd’s discounts stores 

we believe a key element of our success at both ross and dd’s discounts is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasure hunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers at most stores shopping carts andor baskets are available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

we accept a variety of payment methods we provide refunds on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to do this are labor costs that are generally lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

information systems 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include continued enhancements to our information and data security merchandising distribution transportation store and financial systems these initiatives support future growth the execution and achievement of our plans as well as ongoing stability and compliance 

distribution 

we own and operate six   distribution processing facilities—three in california one in pennsylvania and two in south carolina we ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model 

we own four  and lease five  other warehouse facilities for packaway storage we also use other thirdparty facilities including three warehouses for storage of packaway inventory 

we utilize a combination of our own and thirdparty cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support our current store growth information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

advertising 

advertising for ross dress for less relies primarily on television to communicate the ross value proposition—savings off the same brands carried at leading department or specialty stores every day this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position while television is our primary advertising medium we continue to utilize additional channels including social media to communicate our brand position advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on radio and new store grand openings 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross ®  ross dress for less ®  and dd’s discounts ®  have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of february 2 2019  we had approximately 88100  total employees which includes both full and parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customers and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization we also continue to make improvements to our merchandising systems to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are wellpositioned to compete based on each of these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from online retailers department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future

our financial condition results of operations cash flows and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors risks and uncertainties that apply to both ross and dd’s discounts include without limitation the following 

competitive pressures in the apparel and homerelated merchandise retailing industry are high 

the retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store and online formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector we compete for customers associates store locations and merchandise with many other local regional and national retailers traditional department stores upscale mass merchandisers other offprice retailers specialty stores internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing business strategies and promotional activity particularly during holiday periods in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition the substantial sales growth in ecommerce within the last decade has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors new business models and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online offprice shopping alternatives intense pressures from our competitors our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape or a failure to effectively execute our offprice model could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause us to take greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins 

unexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and homerelated merchandise could adversely affect us 

our success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand we work on an ongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer needs it is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the multiple markets in which we operate throughout the united states although our offprice business model provides us certain advantages and may allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers have in adjusting our merchandise mix to everchanging consumer tastes our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer trends and preferences particularly in our newer geographic markets failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends preferences and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

adverse andor unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and other merchandise and may result in temporary store closures and disruptions in deliveries of merchandise to our stores 

unseasonable weather and prolonged extreme temperatures and events such as storms affect consumers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop and may adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise among other things weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or require us to close certain stores temporarily thereby reducing store traffic even if stores are not closed many customers may be unable to go or may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather as a result adverse or unseasonable weather in any of our markets could lead to disappointing sales and cause us to increase our markdowns which may negatively affect our sales and margins 

we are subject to impacts from the macroeconomic environment financial and credit markets and geopolitical conditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income 

consumer spending habits for the merchandise we sell are affected by many factors including prevailing economic conditions recession and fears of recession levels of unemployment salaries and wage rates housing costs energy and fuel costs income tax rates and the timing of tax refunds inflation consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer perceptions of personal wellbeing and security availability of consumer credit consumer debt levels and consumers’ disposable income adverse developments in any of these areas could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins all of our stores are located in the united states and its territories so we are especially susceptible to changes in the us economy     

in order to achieve our planned gross margins we must effectively manage our inventories markdowns and inventory shortage 

we purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans if our sales plans significantly differ from actual demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory resulting in decreased profit margins we also may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales opportunities as a regular part of our business we purchase “packaway” inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores varies by merchandise category and by season but it typically remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory if we make packaway purchases that do not align with consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores we could have significant inventory markdowns changes in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow although we have various systems to help protect against loss or theft of our inventory both when in storage and once distributed to our stores we may have damaged lost or stolen inventory called “shortage” in higher amounts than we forecast which would result in writeoffs lost sales and reduced margins 

we depend on the market availability quantity and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices 

opportunistic buying lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our offprice business strategy maintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is also key to our ability to attract customers and sustain our sales and gross margins our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with our merchants who are in the marketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season our ability to meet or exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that we can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers to the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced to the extent that certain of our vendors decide not to sell to us or go out of business the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could also be materially reduced because a significant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries changes in us tariffs trade relationships or tax policies that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of imported goods could also result in disruptions to our existing supply relationships shortages or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality valuepriced merchandise would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and margins 

information or data security breaches including cyberattacks on our transaction processing and computer information systems could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of customer credit card employee or other private and valuable information that we handle in the ordinary course of our business disrupt our operations damage our reputation and increase our costs 

like other large retailers we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process transmit and store payment card and other personal and confidential information and to provide information or data security for those transactions some of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check approvals and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards are controlled by the banking and payment card industry not by us cyber criminals may attempt to penetrate our point of sale and other information systems to misappropriate customer or business information including but not limited to creditdebit card personnel or trade information despite security measures we have in place and our efforts to prevent monitor and mitigate attacks and errors our facilities and systems or those of thirdparty service providers we utilize or connect to may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors phishing and similar fraudulent attacks or other similar events it is also possible that an associate within our company or a third party we do business with may purposefully or inadvertently cause a security breach involving such information the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and advances in computer capabilities and remote access increases these risks a breach of our information or data security a system shut down or other response we may take or our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a loss of personal or business information could result in damage to our reputation loss of customer confidence violation or alleged violation of applicable laws and expose us to civil claims litigation and regulatory action and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations 

disruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver product to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner 

various information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business we depend on the integrity continuous availability and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores track inventory flow manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics generate performance and financial reports and support merchandising decisions 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace information processes and systems that are key to managing our business we must monitor and choose sound investments and implement them at the right pace the risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken an excessive rate of technological change could detract from the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from new technology poorly targeting opportunities failing to make good investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could damage our competitive position and adversely impact our business and results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system changes could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide us with the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

our information systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as severe storms fires earthquakes floods acts of terrorism and design or usage errors by our employees or by third parties if our information systems or our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport merchandise to our stores or our distribution centers which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or increased supply chain costs such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters trade restrictions tariffs thirdparty strikes or ineffective cross dock operations work stoppages or slowdowns shipping capacity constraints supply or shipping interruptions or costs or other factors beyond our control any such disruptions could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

we need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth 

successful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas we compete with other retailers and businesses for acceptable store locations for the purpose of identifying locations we rely in part on consumer demographics while we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations we recognize that this information cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy time frames for negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected cancellations we may not be able to open new stores or if opened operate those new stores profitably construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results additionally we may not be able to renegotiate our current lease terms which could negatively impact our operating results new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability of other existing stores if we cannot acquire sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the economics of our new stores in various markets 

to achieve growth we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets 

our growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our offprice model in current markets and in new geographic regions there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets stores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction occupancy advertising or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets thereby affecting our overall profitability new markets may have competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may require us to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and retain qualified associates 

consumer problems or legal issues involving the quality safety or authenticity of products we sell could harm our reputation result in lost sales andor increase our costs 

various governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell these regulations and related laws frequently change and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated because of our opportunistic buying strategy we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors that we have not dealt with before although our vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally rely on our vendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable product safety and other laws vendor noncompliance with consumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls make certain products unsalable or require us to incur significant compliance costs 

regardless of fault any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we offer particularly products such as food and children’s items issues with the authenticity of merchandise or our inability or that of our vendors to comply on a timely basis with laws and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our reputation result in lost sales inventory writeoffs uninsured product liability or other legal claims penalties or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs 

an adverse outcome in various legal regulatory or tax matters could damage our reputation or brand and increase our costs 

as an ordinary part of our business we are involved in various legal proceedings regulatory reviews tax audits or other legal matters these may include lawsuits inquiries demands or other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and private plaintiffs including those relating to employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation securities real estate tort commercial consumer protection privacy product compliance and safety advertising comparative pricing intellectual property tax escheat and whistleblower claims we continue to be involved in a number of employmentrelated lawsuits including class actions which are primarily in california 

we are subject to federal state and local rules and regulations in the united states and to various international laws which change from time to time these legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business including the cost of health care workforce management and employee benefits minimum wages advertising comparative pricing importexport sourcing and manufacturing data protection intellectual property and others if we fail to comply or are alleged not to comply with any of these requirements we may be subject to fines settlements penalties or other costs in addition an adverse outcome or the adverse publicity from the claims in any of these matters may damage our reputation or brand we are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state and local tax authorities and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take 

significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax provisions and accruals for legal claims actual results may differ and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes in addition applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and those changes could have material effects on our reported operating results and financial condition 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

our reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry such an incident could also include alleged acts or omissions by or situations involving our suppliers or their contractors or subcontractors the landlord for our stores or our associates outside of work and may pertain to social or political issues or protests largely unrelated to our business the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons continues to increase the availability of information whether correct or erroneous on social media platforms is virtually immediate as is its impact many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content the opportunity for dissemination of information including inaccurate information is seemingly limitless and readily available information concerning our company may be posted on such platforms at any time information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate which could negatively affect our sales diminish customer trust reduce employee morale and productivity and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified associates the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction   

we must continually attract train and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our offprice retail strategies 

like other retailers we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization management stores and other key areas many of our retail store associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or healthcare benefits 

any increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or if we fail to pay such higher wages may result in increased turnover excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding hiring and training new associates if we cannot hire enough qualified associates or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from thirdparty providers especially during our peak seasons our operations could be negatively impacted 

because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must also attract train and retain our key associates across the company especially within our buying organization the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our growth operations or financial position 

we must effectively advertise and market our business 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of our stores although we use marketing and advertising programs to attract customers to our stores particularly through television our competitors may spend more or use different approaches which could provide them with a competitive advantage our advertising and other promotional programs may not be effective or may be perceived negatively or could require increased expenditures any of which could adversely affect sales or increase costs 

we are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries 

risks in importing and selling such merchandise include import duties and quotas compliance with antidumping regulations economic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions including inflation recession and exchange rate fluctuations foreign government regulations employment and labor matters concerns relating to human rights working conditions and other issues in factories or countries where merchandise is produced transparency of sourcing and supply chains exposure on product warranty and intellectual property issues consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise wars and fears of war political unrest natural disasters regulations to address climate change and trade restrictions 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell even when we purchase it domestically often as excess inventory sold to us by a domestic vendor is originally manufactured in other countries in addition we directly source a portion of the products sold in our stores from foreign vendors predominantly in asia including china we also buy products that originate from foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors and manufacturers’ representatives although our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors when we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer 

to the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products any event causing a disruption of imports including the imposition of import restrictions war and acts of terrorism could adversely affect our business the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas or both applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us we cannot predict whether any of the countries from which our products are sourced or in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments or the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions 

we require our vendors for both import and domestic purchasing to contractually confirm that they adhere to various conduct compliance and other requirements including those relating to environmental employment and labor including wages and working conditions health safety and antibribery standards from time to time our vendors their contractors or their subcontractors may be alleged to not be in compliance with these standards or with applicable local laws although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise and to monitor our suppliers this does not guarantee that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation could subject us to claims and liability and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in us tax or trade policy regarding apparel and homerelated merchandise produced in other countries could adversely affect our business 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries the us government has at times indicated a willingness to significantly change existing trade policies including those with china this exposes us to risks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise and creates increased uncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins changes in us tariffs quotas trade relationships or tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost of goods andor increase our effective tax rate although such changes would have implications across the entire industry we may fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes in addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in us laws and policies as we make business decisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes miss out on business opportunities or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes these risks could adversely affect our revenues increase our effective tax rates and reduce our profitability 

we may experience volatility in revenues and earnings 

our business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and backtoschool seasons weather and other factors although our offprice business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers we may still experience unexpected decreases in sales from time to time which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins significant operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not adjust proportionately with our sales if sales in a certain period are lower than our plans we may not be able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently which could adversely affect our operating results 

a natural or manmade disaster in california or in another region where we have a concentration of stores offices or a distribution center could harm our business 

our corporate headquarters los angeles buying office three  distribution centers three  warehouses and approximately 23  of our stores are located in california natural or other disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes tornadoes floods or other extreme weather and climate conditions or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism or public health issues such as epidemics in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain or could shut down damage or destroy our stores or distribution facilities 

to support our continuing operations our new store and distribution center growth plans and our stock repurchase program and quarterly dividends we must maintain sufficient liquidity 

we depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities and to supply capital to finance our operations make capital expenditures and acquisitions manage our debt levels and return value to our stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support these activities our growth plans and our financial performance would be adversely affected if necessary to support our operations we could be forced to suspend our stock repurchase program andor discontinue payment of our quarterly cash dividends any failure to pay dividends or repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively affect our stock price 

we have borrowed on occasion to finance some of our activities if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns our operations cash flows and returns to stockholders could be adversely affected

 item 2 properties 

at february 2 2019  we operated a total of 1717  stores of which 1480  were ross stores in 38 states the district of columbia and guam  and 237  were dd’s discounts stores in 18 states  all stores are leased with the exception of two  locations which we own 

during fiscal 2018  we opened 75  new ross stores and closed four  existing stores the average approximate ross store size is 28000  square feet 

during fiscal 2018  we opened 24  new dd’s discounts stores and closed no  existing stores the average approximate dd’s discounts store size is 23000  square feet 

during fiscal 2018  no  one store accounted for more than 1 of our sales 

we carry fire flood wind and earthquake insurance to help mitigate the risk of financial loss that may result from such events 

our real estate strategy in 2019  is to primarily open stores in states where we currently operate to increase our market penetration and leverage overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market we also expect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in 2019  important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the local trade area in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

the following table summarizes the locations of our stores by stateterritory as of february 2 2019  and february 3 2018  



where possible we obtain sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations allowing us to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time at reasonable costs in a given market at february 2 2019  the majority of our stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years  with three to four  renewal options of five years each the average unexpired original lease term of our leased stores is five years or 20 years if renewal options are included see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements 

see additional discussion under “stores” in item 1 

the following table summarizes the location and approximate sizes of our distribution centers warehouses and office locations as of february 2 2019  square footage information for the distribution centers and warehouses represents total ground floor area of the facility square footage information for office space represents total space owned and leased see additional discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 



see additional discussion under “distribution” in item 1 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

like many retailers we have been named in class action lawsuits primarily in california alleging violation of wage and hour laws and consumer protection laws class action litigation remains pending as of february 2 2019  

we are also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business actions filed against us may include commercial product and product safety consumer intellectual property and labor and employmentrelated claims including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that we violated federal state andor local laws actions against us are in various procedural stages many of these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties 

we believe that the resolution of our pending class action litigation and other currently pending legal and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry and believe our share gains over the past few years were driven mainly by continued focus on value by consumers our sales and earnings gains in 2018  continued to benefit from efficient execution of our offprice model throughout all areas of our business our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 2 2019  february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  as fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  respectively fiscal 2017 was a 53week year fiscal 2018 and 2016 were each 52week years 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  



stores   total stores open at the end of fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were 1717  1622  and 1533  respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  increased by 6  6  and 6  from the respective prior years our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2018  increased 08 billion  or 60  compared to the prior year  due to the opening of 95  net new stores during 2018  and a 4  increase in comparable store sales defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2017  increased 13 billion  or 99  compared to the prior year due to the opening of 89  net new stores during 2017  and a 4  increase in sales from comparable stores and the impact of the 53rd week 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  



we intend to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization diversify our merchandise mix and more fully develop our systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2018  increased 6836 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 95  net new stores during the year and a 4  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2018  increased approximately 55 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 40 basis point increase in freight costs a 15 basis point increase in distribution expenses higher buying costs of 10 basis points and higher occupancy costs of five basis points these increases were partially offset by an increase of 15 basis points in merchandise gross margin 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2017  increased 8689 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 89  net new stores during the year and a 4  increase in sales from comparable stores and the impact of the 53rd week 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2017  decreased approximately 25 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 25 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin a 25 basis point decrease in occupancy costs 

and a five basis point decrease in distribution expenses the improvements were partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in freight costs and higher buying costs of five basis points 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018  selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 1729 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 95  net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2018  increased by approximately 30 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to higher wages 

for fiscal 2017  sga increased 1533 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 89  net new stores during the year and the impact of the 53rd week sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2017  decreased by approximately 25 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage resulting from the 4 increase in comparable store sales 

interest expense income net  in fiscal 2018  net interest income improved by 178 million  compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in interest income and higher capitalized interest on information systems projects in fiscal 2017 net interest expense decreased by 88 million compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in interest income the table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  



taxes on earnings our effective tax rates for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were approximately 23  33  and 37  respectively the effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is impacted by changes in laws location of new stores level of earnings and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019  will be between 23 and 24 

in november 2018 we resolved uncertain federal tax positions related to fiscal 2015 with the internal revenue service as a result we recognized a tax benefit of approximately 260 million or approximately 007 of earnings per share in the consolidated statement of earnings 

in fiscal 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” or tax reform was signed into law the tax act made significant changes to us corporate taxation including reducing the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the last month of fiscal 2017 us gaap requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted we applied a us federal income tax rate of 21 for fiscal 2018 and a blended us federal income tax rate of approximately 34 for fiscal 2017 this rate reduction resulted in an increase to our earnings per share of approximately 070 for fiscal 2018 for fiscal 2017 the rate reduction along with the remeasurement of deferred taxes resulted in an increase to our earnings per share of approximately 021 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2018  were higher than in fiscal 2017  primarily due to lower taxes as a result of tax reform and higher interest income partially offset by higher cost of goods sold and higher sga expenses net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2017  were higher compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to lower taxes due to tax reform lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses 

earnings per share  diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018  was 426  which includes a per share benefit of approximately 070 from tax reform and 007 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter compared to 355 in the prior year which included a per share benefit of approximately 021 from tax reform and a 010 benefit from the 53rd week the 20  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an increase of approximately 16  in net earnings which included a 14 impact from tax reform and a 2 impact from the favorable resolution of a tax matter and 4 from the reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017  was 355  which included a per share benefit of approximately 021 from tax reform and 010 from the 53rd week compared to 283 in fiscal 2016 the 25  increase in diluted earnings per share was attributable to an increase of approximately 22  in net earnings which included a 7 impact from tax reform and a 4 impact from the 53rd week and 3 from the reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll rent taxes and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores and investments in distribution centers information systems and buying and corporate offices we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends and for the repayment of debt as it becomes due 



1 as the result of the adoption of asu 201618 statement of cash flow topic 230 restricted cash  the prior year amounts were retrospectively adjusted see note a 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 20667 million  16813 million  and 15589 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization and for deferred taxes our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns 

the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily driven by higher earnings the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year and lower income tax payments the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year resulted in higher  accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory which was 67  65  and 68  as of february 2 2019  february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  respectively 

the increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by higher earnings partially offset by the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus the prior year and by the timing of income taxes payments 

as a regular part of our business packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise purchase opportunities in the marketplace packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but 

typically packaway remains in storage less than six months we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers 

changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow at the end of fiscal 2018  packaway inventory was 46  of total inventory compared to 49  and 49  at the end of fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 4104 million  3548 million  and 2962 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  was primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures 

in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  our capital expenditures were 4139 million  3714 million  and 2979 million  respectively our capital expenditures include costs to build expand and improve distribution centers open new stores and improve existing stores and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems buying and corporate offices the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to investments in our distribution centers and information technology infrastructure investments for our stores buying corporate offices and transportation the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to information technology infrastructure investments for our stores buying and corporate offices we opened 99  96  and 93  new stores in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

in november 2017 we entered into a saleleaseback transaction for one of our previously owned stores and received net cash proceeds of 160 million recognized a gain on sale of 63 million and deferred the residual 75 million gain over the remaining tenyear lease term 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 



we are forecasting approximately 600 million  in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019  to fund costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new ross and dd’s discounts stores the upgrade or relocation of existing stores investments in information technology systems initial investment in our next distribution center and for various other expenditures related to our stores distribution centers buying and corporate offices we expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 15315 million  11494 million and 9161 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations 

in february 2017 our board of directors approved a twoyear 175 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2018 in march 2018 our board of directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase authorization for fiscal 2018 by 200 million to 1075 billion up from the previously available 875 million 

we repurchased 125 million  135 million  and 116 million  shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 1075 million  875 million  and 700 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we also acquired 07 million  07 million  and 07 million  shares in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively of treasury stock from our employee stock equity compensation programs for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 544 million  454 million  and 433 million  during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

in march 2019 our board of directors approved a new twoyear 255 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2020 

on march 5 2019  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0255  per common share payable on march 29 2019  our board of directors declared cash dividends of 0225  per common share in march may august and november 2018  cash dividends of 0160  per common share in february may august and november 2017  and cash dividends of 0135  per common share in march may august and november 2016

on december 13 2018 we repaid at maturity the 85 million principal amount of the series a 638 unsecured senior notes 

shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit bank lines and other credit sources to meet our capital and liquidity requirements including lease payment obligations in 2019  

our existing 600 million  unsecured revolving credit facility expires in april 2021  and contains a 300 million  sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit subject to increase in proportion to any increase in the size of the credit facility the facility also contains an option allowing us to increase the size of our revolving credit facility by up to an additional 200 million with the agreement of the lenders interest on any borrowings under this facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin currently 100 basis points and is payable quarterly and upon maturity as of february 2 2019  we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding on this facility and our 600 million credit facility remains in place and available 

the revolving credit facility is subject to a financial leverage ratio covenant as of february 2 2019  we were in compliance with this covenant 

we estimate that existing cash balances cash flows from operations bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital investments repayment of debt common stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months 

contractual obligations 

the table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of february 2 2019  



1 we have a 779 million  liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is included in other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets this liability is excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated

offbalance sheet arrangements 

operating leases  we currently lease all but two  of our store locations we also lease five warehouse facilities and two buying offices in addition we have a ground lease related to our new york buying office except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment these leased locations do not represent longterm capital investments 

two of our leased warehouses are in carlisle pennsylvania with leases expiring in 2019  and 2020  one is in fort mill south carolina with the lease expiring in 2024  one is in rock hill south carolina with the lease expiring in 2028 and one is in shafter california with the lease expiring in 2029 all of the warehouse leases contain renewal provisions

other 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 

in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain descriptions of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

merchandise inventory   our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weighted average basis or net realizable value we purchase inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to the company’s store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory accounted for approximately 46  49  and 49  of total inventories as of february 2 2019  february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  respectively merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets   we review our longlived assets for a potential impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group an impairment loss would be recognized to write the asset group down to its fair value if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2018  2017  or 2016  

lease accounting   when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date tenant improvement allowances are amortized over the lease term changes in deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows see recently issued accounting standards below 

insurance obligations   we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation general liability and employeerelated health care benefits our selfinsurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

income taxes   we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures our policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 

recently issued accounting standards we consider the applicability and impact of all asus issued by the   fasb asus not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial results 

in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201602 leases topic 842  as amended the asu requires balance sheet recognition for all leases with lease terms greater than one year including a lease liability which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and a rightofuse asset which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term we plan to adopt the new leases standard effective february 3 2019 using the optional transition method on a modified retrospective basis by recognizing a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and do not plan to restate comparative periods in addition we do not plan to elect the transitional package of practical expedients or the use of hindsight upon adoption upon the adoption of the asu we do not expect to record a rightofuse asset and related lease liability for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less and plan to account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component 

we are finalizing the expected effect adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements our current estimate of lease liabilities based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments using discount rates as of the effective date and the corresponding rightofuse assets is approximately 29 billion the expected cumulativeeffect adjustment to beginning retained earnings is a decrease of approximately 20 million primarily related to the writeoff of previously capitalized initial direct costs that are no longer capitalized under the asu partially offset by the writeoff of the deferred gain on a previous saleleaseback transaction that meets the sale definition under the asu we do not believe adoption of this asu will have a significant impact to our consolidated statements of earnings stockholders’ equity and cash flows 

recently adopted accounting standards in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers accounting standards codification asc 606 which along with subsequent amendments supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “revenue recognition asc 605” this guidance provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized and requires entities to recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services we adopted asc 606 as of february 4 2018 using the modified retrospective method results for reporting periods beginning on or after february 4 2018 are presented under asc 606 while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with asc 605 upon adoption of asc 606 we recorded a cumulativeeffect adjustment to increase beginning retained earnings by 20 million as of february 4 2018 primarily due to the change in the timing of the recognition of stored value card breakage the impact of applying asc 606 was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended february 2 2019  

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230  restricted cash asu 201618 requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows the standard also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows we adopted asu 201618 as of february 4 2018 using the retrospective method 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  asu 201609 provides for changes to accounting for stock compensation including 1 excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share based payment awards will be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the reporting period in which they occur previously such amounts were recognized in additional paidin capital 2 excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows and 3 the option to elect to estimate forfeitures or account for them when they occur the impact of recording excess tax benefits in income taxes in our consolidated statement of earnings may be material depending upon our future stock price on vest date in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date and our future grants of stockbased compensation 

we adopted asu 201609 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and elected to apply this adoption prospectively except for forfeitures which we adopted on a modified retrospective basis accordingly prior periods have not been adjusted as a result of adoption for the fiscal year ended february 3 2018 we recognized 163 million  of excess tax benefits related to stockbased payments as a reduction to our provision for income taxes these items were historically recorded in additional paidin capital we also presented cash flows related to excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows and elected to account for forfeitures as incurred beginning on january 29 2017 the impact of this accounting policy election for forfeitures was a cumulativeeffect adjustment to decrease retained earnings by 11 million  as of january 29 2017 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2018  and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd’s discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of february 2 2019  

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of february 2 2019  we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

as of february 2 2019  we have one outstanding series of unsecured 653 series b senior notes due december 2021 with an aggregate principal amount of 65 million we also have unsecured 3375 senior notes due september 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of 250 million interest that is payable on our senior notes is based on fixed interest rates and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates 

interest is receivable on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended february 2 2019  we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible nearterm changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion   stores—ross dress for less ®  “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  

ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1409  locations in 37 states the district of columbia and guam  as of february 3 2018  ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices every day ross’ target customers are primarily from middle income households 

we also operate 213  dd’s discounts stores in 16 states  as of february 3 2018  dd’s discounts features more moderatelypriced firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood and its target customers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than ross customers 

the merchant store field and distribution organizations for ross and dd’s discounts are separate and distinct the two chains share certain other corporate and support services 

both our ross and dd’s discounts brands target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are based on these customer profiles we believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

• maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store 

• meet customer needs on a local basis 

• deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer 

• manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 3 2018  january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  as fiscal 2017  fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  respectively fiscal 2017 was a 53week year fiscal 2016 and 2015 were each 52week years 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brand name and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices every day at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising which emphasizes a strong value message our stores offer a treasurehunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item our merchandise offerings include but are not limited to apparel including footwear and accessories small furniture home accents bed and bath beauty toys luggage gourmet food cookware and watches 

purchasing we have a combined network of about 8000  merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our six  distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on purchases 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at great values or can be stored as packaway merchandise 

packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2017  we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 49  and 49  of total inventories as of february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  respectively we believe the strong discounts we offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

our primary buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nation’s two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

at the end of fiscal 2017  we had approximately 800  merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct and each includes merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have on average eight  years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdale’s burlington stores foot locker kohl’s lord  taylor macy’s nordstrom saks and tjx we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in our merchant organization to further develop our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brand name product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on most of our price tags which display our selling price as well as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

as of february 3 2018  we operated a total of 1622  stores comprised of 1409  ross stores and 213  dd’s discounts stores our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit we cluster ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management we do the same for dd’s discounts stores 

we believe a key element of our success at both ross and dd’s discounts is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasure hunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers at most stores shopping carts andor baskets are available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

we accept a variety of payment methods we provide refunds on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to do this are labor costs that are generally lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

information systems 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include enhancements to our information and data security merchandising distribution transportation store and financial systems these initiatives support future growth the execution and achievement of our plans as well as ongoing stability and compliance 

distribution 

we own and operate six   distribution processing facilities—three in california one in pennsylvania and two in south carolina we ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model 

we own four  and lease three  other warehouse facilities for packaway storage we also use other thirdparty facilities including two warehouses for storage of packaway inventory 

we utilize a combination of our own and thirdparty cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support our current store growth information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

advertising 

advertising for ross dress for less relies primarily on television to communicate the ross value proposition—savings off the same brands carried at leading department or specialty stores every day this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position while television is our primary advertising medium we continue to utilize additional channels including social media to communicate our brand position advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local media initiatives 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross ®  ross dress for less ®  and dd’s discounts ®  have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of february 3 2018  we had approximately 82700  total employees which includes both full and parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customers and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization we also continue to make improvements to our core merchandising system to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are wellpositioned to compete based on each of these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from online retailers department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2017  and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain forwardlooking statements with respect to anticipated future events and our projected growth financial performance operations and competitive position that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our prior expectations and projections refer to management’s discussion and analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of “forwardlooking statements” 

our financial condition results of operations cash flows and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors risks and uncertainties that apply to both ross and dd’s discounts include without limitation the following 

competitive pressures in the apparel and homerelated merchandise retailing industry are high 

the retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store and online formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector we compete with many other local regional and national retailers traditional department stores upscale mass merchandisers other offprice retailers specialty stores internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce for customers associates store locations and merchandise our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing business strategies and promotional activity particularly during holiday periods in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition the substantial sales growth in the ecommerce industry within the last decade has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors new business models and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online offprice shopping alternatives intense pressures from our competitors our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape or a failure to effectively execute our offprice model could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins 

unexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and homerelated merchandise could adversely affect us 

our success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand we work on an ongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer needs it is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the multiple markets in which we operate throughout the united states although our offprice business model provides us certain advantages and could allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers in adjusting our merchandise mix to everchanging consumer tastes our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer trends and preferences particularly in our newer geographic markets failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends preferences and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

adverse andor unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and other merchandise and may result in temporary store closures and disruptions in deliveries of merchandise to our stores 

unseasonable weather and prolonged extreme temperatures and events such as storms affect consumers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop and could adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise among other things weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or require us to close certain stores temporarily thereby reducing store traffic even if stores are not closed many customers may be unable to go or may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather as a result adverse or unseasonable weather in any of our markets could lead to disappointing sales and increase our markdowns which may negatively affect our sales and margins 

we are subject to impacts from the macroeconomic environment financial and credit markets and geopolitical conditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income 

consumer spending habits for the merchandise we sell are affected by many factors including prevailing economic conditions recession and fears of recession levels of unemployment salaries and wage rates housing costs energy and fuel costs income tax rates and the timing of tax refunds inflation consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer perceptions of personal wellbeing and security availability of consumer credit consumer debt levels and consumers’ disposable income adverse developments in any of these areas could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins all of our stores are located in the united states and its territories so we are especially susceptible to changes in the us economy     

in order to achieve our planned gross margins we must effectively manage our inventories markdowns and inventory shortage 

we purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans if our sales plans significantly differ from actual demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory resulting in decreased profit margins we also may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales opportunities as a regular part of our business we purchase “packaway” inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores varies by merchandise category and by season but it typically remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory if we make packaway purchases that do not meet consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores we could have significant inventory markdowns changes in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow although we have various systems to help protect against loss or theft of our inventory both when in storage and once distributed to our stores we may have damaged lost or stolen inventory called “shortage” in higher amounts than we forecast which would result in writeoffs lost sales and reduced margins 

we depend on the market availability quantity and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices 

opportunistic buying lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our offprice business strategy maintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is also key to our ability to attract customers and sustain our sales and gross margins our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion on our merchants who are in the marketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season our ability to meet or exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that we can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers to the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced to the extent that certain of our vendors decide not to sell to us or go out of business the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could also be materially reduced because a significant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries changes in us tariffs trade relationships or tax policies that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of imported goods could also result in disruptions to our existing supply relationships shortages or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality valuepriced merchandise would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and margins 

information or data security breaches including cyberattacks on our transaction processing and computer information systems could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of customer credit card employee or other private and valuable information that we handle in the ordinary course of our business disrupt our operations damage our reputation and increase our costs 

like other large retailers we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process transmit and store payment card and other personal and confidential information and to provide information or data security for those transactions some of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check approvals and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards are controlled by the banking and payment card industry not by us cyber criminals may attempt to penetrate our point of sale and other information systems to misappropriate customer or business information including but not limited to creditdebit card personnel or trade information despite security measures we have in place and our efforts to prevent monitor and mitigate attacks and errors our facilities and systems or those of thirdparty service providers we utilize or connect to may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors phishing and similar fraudulent attacks or other similar events it is also possible that an associate within our company or a third party we do business with may purposefully or inadvertently cause a security breach involving such information the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and advances in computer capabilities and remote access increases these risks a breach of our information or data security a system shut down or other response we may take or our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a loss of personal or business information could result in damage to our reputation loss of customer confidence violation or alleged violation of applicable laws and expose us to civil claims litigation and regulatory action and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations 

disruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver product to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner 

various information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business we depend on the integrity and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores track inventory flow manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics generate performance and financial reports and support merchandising decisions 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace information processes and systems that are key to managing our business we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace the risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from new technology targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could damage our competitive position and adversely impact our business and results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system changes could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

our information systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as severe storms fires earthquakes floods acts of terrorism and design or usage errors by our employees or by third parties if our information systems or our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport merchandise to our stores or our distribution centers which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or increased supply chain costs such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters trade restrictions tariffs thirdparty strikes or ineffective cross dock operations work stoppages or slowdowns shipping capacity constraints supply or shipping interruptions or costs or other factors beyond our control any such disruptions could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

we need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth 

successful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas we compete with other retailers and businesses for acceptable store locations for the purpose of identifying locations we rely in part on consumer demographics while we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations we recognize that this information cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy time frames for negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected cancellations we may not be able to open new stores or if opened operate those stores profitably construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results additionally we may not be able to renegotiate our current lease terms which could negatively impact our operating results new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability of other existing stores if we cannot acquire sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the economics of our new stores in various markets 

to achieve growth we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets 

our growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our offprice model in current markets and in new geographic regions there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets stores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction occupancy advertising or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets thereby affecting our overall profitability new markets may have competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may require us to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and retain qualified associates 

consumer problems or legal issues involving the quality safety or authenticity of products we sell could harm our reputation result in lost sales andor increase our costs 

various governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell these laws and regulations frequently change and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated because of our opportunistic buying strategy we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors that we have not dealt with before although our vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally rely on our vendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable product safety and other laws vendor noncompliance with consumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls make certain products unsalable or require us to incur significant compliance costs 

regardless of fault any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise particularly products such as food and children’s items issues with the authenticity of merchandise or our inability or that of our vendors to comply on a timely basis with such laws and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our reputation result in lost sales inventory writeoffs uninsured product liability or other legal claims penalties or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs 

an adverse outcome in various legal regulatory or tax matters could damage our reputation or brand and increase our costs 

as an ordinary part of our business we are involved in various legal proceedings regulatory reviews tax audits or other legal matters these may include lawsuits inquiries demands or other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and private plaintiffs including those relating to employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation securities real estate tort commercial consumer protection privacy product compliance and safety advertising comparative pricing intellectual property tax escheat and whistleblower claims we continue to be involved in a number of employmentrelated lawsuits including class actions which are primarily in california 

we are subject to federal state and local rules and regulations in the united states and to various international laws which change from time to time these legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business including the cost of health care workforce management and employee benefits minimum wages advertising comparative pricing importexport sourcing and manufacturing data protection intellectual property and others if we fail to comply or are alleged not to comply with any of these requirements we may be subject to fines settlements penalties or other costs in addition an adverse outcome or the adverse publicity from the claims in any of these matters may harm and damage our reputation or brand we are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state and local tax authorities and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take 

significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for both legal claims and for taxes actual results may differ and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes in addition applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and those changes could have material effects on our reported operating results and financial condition 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

our reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry such an incident could also include alleged acts or omissions by or situations involving our suppliers or their contractors or subcontractors the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons continues to increase the availability of information whether correct or erroneous on social media platforms is virtually immediate as is its impact many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted the opportunity for dissemination of information including inaccurate information is seemingly limitless and readily available information concerning our company may be posted on such platforms at any time information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which could negatively impact sales diminish customer trust reduce employee morale and productivity and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified associates the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction   

we must continually attract train and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our offprice retail strategies 

like other retailers we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization management and other key areas many of our retail store associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or healthcare benefits 

any increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or if we fail to pay such higher wages may result in increased turnover excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding hiring and training new associates if we cannot hire enough qualified associates or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from thirdparty providers especially during our peak season our operations could be negatively impacted 

because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must also attract train and retain our key associates across the company including within our buying organization the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our growth operations or financial position 

we must effectively advertise and market our business 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of our stores although we use marketing and advertising programs to attract customers to our stores particularly through television our competitors may spend more or use different approaches which could provide them with a competitive advantage our advertising and other promotional programs may not be effective or may be perceived negatively or could require increased expenditures which could adversely affect sales or increase costs 

we are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries 

these risks and uncertainties include import duties and quotas compliance with antidumping regulations work stoppages economic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions including inflation and recession foreign government regulations employment and labor matters concerns relating to human rights working conditions and other issues in factories or countries where merchandise is produced transparency of sourcing and supply chains exposure on product warranty and intellectual property issues consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise wars and fears of war political unrest natural disasters regulations to address climate change and trade restrictions 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell even when we purchase it domestically often as excess inventory sold to us by a domestic vendor is originally manufactured in other countries in addition we directly source a portion of the products sold in our stores from foreign vendors predominantly in asia including china we also buy product from foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors and manufacturers’ representatives although our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors when we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer 

to the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products any event causing a disruption of imports including the imposition of import restrictions war and acts of terrorism could adversely affect our business the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured if the instability affects the production or export of merchandise from those countries trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas or both applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us we cannot predict whether any of the countries from which our products are sourced or in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments or the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions 

we require our vendors for both import and domestic purchasing to adhere to various conduct compliance and other requirements including those relating to environmental employment and labor including wages and working conditions health safety and antibribery standards from time to time our vendors their contractors or their subcontractors may be alleged to not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation could subject us to claims and liability and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in us tax or tariff policy regarding apparel and homerelated merchandise produced in other countries could adversely affect our business 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries the us government has at times indicated a willingness to significantly change existing trade policies this exposes us to risks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise and creates increased uncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins changes in us tariffs quotas trade relationships or tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost of goods andor increase our effective tax rate although such changes would have implications across the entire industry we may fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes in addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in us laws and policies as we make business decisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes miss out on business opportunities or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes these risks could adversely affect our revenues increase our effective tax rates and reduce our profitability 

we may experience volatility in revenues and earnings 

our business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and backtoschool seasons weather and other factors although our offprice business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers we may still experience unexpected decreases in sales from time to time which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins significant operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not adjust proportionately with our sales if sales in a certain period are lower than our plans we may not be able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently which may impact our operating results 

a natural or manmade disaster in california or in another region where we have a concentration of stores offices or a distribution center could harm our business 

our corporate headquarters los angeles buying office three  operating distribution centers two  warehouses and approximately 23  of our stores are located in california natural or other disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes tornadoes floods or other extreme weather and climate conditions or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism or public health issues such as epidemics in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain or could shut down damage or destroy our stores or distribution facilities 

to support our continuing operations our new store and distribution center growth plans and our stock repurchase program and quarterly dividends we must maintain sufficient liquidity 

we depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities and to supply capital to finance our operations make capital expenditures and acquisitions manage our debt levels and return value to our stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support these activities our growth plans and our financial performance would be adversely affected if necessary to support our operations we could be forced to suspend our stock repurchase program andor discontinue payment of our quarterly cash dividends any failure to pay dividends or repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price 

we have borrowed on occasion to finance some of our activities if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns our operations cash flows and returns to stockholders could be adversely affected

our real estate strategy in 2018  is to primarily open stores in states where we currently operate to increase our market penetration and leverage overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market we also expect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in 2018  important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the local trade area in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

the following table summarizes the locations of our stores by stateterritory as of february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  



where possible we obtain sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations allowing us to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time at reasonable costs in a given market at february 3 2018  the majority of our stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years  with three to four  renewal options of five years each the average unexpired original lease term of our leased stores is five years or 21 years  if renewal options are included see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 3 legal proceedings 

like many retailers we have been named in class action lawsuits primarily in california alleging violation of wage and hour laws and consumer protection laws class action litigation remains pending as of february 3 2018  

we are also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business actions filed against us may include commercial product and product safety consumer intellectual property and labor and employmentrelated claims including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that we violated federal state andor local laws actions against us are in various procedural stages many of these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties 

we believe that the resolution of our pending class action litigation and other currently pending legal and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

we are using the dow jones apparel retailers index for the first time in our performance graph this year because we believe the retail companies comprising that index are more closely aligned with the segment of the retail industry in which we operate and it provides a more relevant comparison against which to measure our stock performance for comparison purposes we have also included the sp retailing group in our fiscal 2017 performance graph we do not plan to include the sp retailing group index in next year’s performance graph

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

ross stores inc operates two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion stores—ross dress for less ®  “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1409  locations in 37 states the district of columbia and guam  as of february 3 2018  ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices every day we also operate 213  dd’s discounts stores in 16 states  as of february 3 2018  that feature a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry and believe our share gains over the past few years were driven mainly by continued focus on value by consumers our sales and earnings gains in 2017  continued to benefit from efficient execution of our offprice model throughout all areas of our business our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 3 2018  january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  as fiscal 2017  fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  respectively fiscal 2017 was a 53week year fiscal 2016 and 2015 were each 52week years 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  



stores   total stores open at the end of fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were 1622  1533  and 1446  respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  increased by 6  6  and 6  from the respective prior years our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2017  increased 13 billion  or 99  compared to the prior year  due to the opening of 89  net new stores during 2017  a 4  increase in comparable store sales defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months and the impact of the 53rd week sales for fiscal 2016  increased 09 billion  or 78  compared to the prior year due to the opening of 87  net new stores during 2016  and a 4  increase in sales from comparable stores 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  



we intend to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization diversify our merchandise mix and more fully develop our systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2017  increased 8689 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 89  net new stores during the year a 4  increase in sales from comparable stores and the impact of the 53rd week 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2017  decreased approximately 25 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 25 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin a 25 basis point decrease in occupancy costs and a five basis point decrease in distribution expenses these improvements were partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in freight costs and higher buying costs of five basis points 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2016  increased 5968 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 87  net new stores during the year and a 4  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016  decreased approximately 55 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin a 10 basis point decrease in buying expenses and lower distribution and occupancy costs by five basis points each 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017  selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 1533 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 89  net new stores during the year and the impact of the 53rd week sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2017  decreased by approximately 25 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage resulting from the 4  increase in comparable store sales 

for fiscal 2016  sga increased 1517 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 87  net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016  increased by approximately 15 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to higher wages 

interest expense income net  in fiscal 2017  net interest expense decreased by 88 million  primarily due to an increase in interest income the table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  



taxes on earnings our effective tax rates for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were approximately 33  37  and 37  respectively the effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is impacted by changes in laws location of new stores level of earnings and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018  will be between 24 and 25 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” or tax reform was signed into law on december 22 2017 the tax act made significant changes to us corporate taxation including reducing the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 permitting immediate capital expensing of certain qualified property and limiting the tax deductions available for certain executive compensation and employee fringe benefits us gaap requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted as a result the company applied a blended us federal income tax rate of approximately 34 for fiscal 2017 due to the lower tax rate of 21 becoming effective in the last month of that fiscal year this reduced tax rate resulted in a tax benefit of 249 million  we recorded an additional tax benefit of 552 million  due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities both of these tax benefits were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 also on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the tax act as permitted by sab 118 both of the tax benefits recorded by us in fiscal 2017 represent provisional amounts based on our current best estimates any adjustments made to those provisional amounts will be included in income from operations and recorded as an adjustment to tax expense through the fiscal year ending february 2 2019 the recorded provisional amounts reflect assumptions made based upon our current interpretation of the tax act and may change as we receive additional clarification and guidance in the form of technical corrections to the tax act or regulations issued by the us treasury 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2017  were higher than in fiscal 2016  primarily due to lower taxes due to tax reform lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016  were higher compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to lower cost of goods sold partially offset by higher sga expenses 

earnings per share  diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017  was 355  compared to 283  in the prior year which includes a per share benefit of approximately 021 from the recently enacted tax reform legislation and 010 from the 53rd week the 25  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an increase of approximately 22  in net earnings which included a 7 impact from tax reform and a 4 impact from the 53rd week and a 3  reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016  was 283  compared to 251  in fiscal 2015  the 13  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an increase of approximately 10  in net earnings and a 3 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll rent taxes and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores and investments in distribution centers information systems and buying and corporate offices we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends and for the repayment of debt as it becomes due 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 16813 million  15589 million  and 13262 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization and for deferred taxes our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns 

the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily driven by higher earnings partially offset by the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year and by the timing of income tax payments the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year resulted in lower  accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory which was 65  68  and 67  as of february 3 2018  january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  respectively 

the increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by higher earnings the timing of receipts and related payments versus the prior year and by higher income taxes payable 

as a regular part of our business packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise purchase opportunities in the marketplace packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers 

changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow at the end of fiscal 2017  packaway inventory was 49  of total inventory compared to 49  and 47  at the end of fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 3531 million  2928 million  and 3625 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  was primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures 

in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  our capital expenditures were 3714 million  2979 million  and 3670 million  respectively our capital expenditures include costs to build expand and improve distribution centers open new stores and improve existing stores and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems buying and corporate offices the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to information technology infrastructure investments for our stores buying and corporate offices the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the completion in 2015 of the rollout of new point of sale equipment in our stores and construction of a distribution center we opened 96  93  and 90  new stores in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

in november 2017 we entered into a saleleaseback transaction for one of our previously owned stores and received net cash proceeds of 160 million recognized a gain on sale of 63 million and deferred the residual 75 million gain over the remaining tenyear lease term 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 



we are forecasting approximately 475 million  in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018  to fund costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new ross and dd’s discounts stores the upgrade or relocation of existing stores investments in information technology systems and for various other expenditures related to our stores distribution centers buying and corporate offices we expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations

other 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 

in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain descriptions of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

merchandise inventory   our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weighted average basis or net realizable value we purchase inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to the company’s store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory accounted for approximately 49  49  and 47  of total inventories as of february 3 2018  january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  respectively merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets   we review our longlived assets for a potential impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group an impairment loss would be recognized to write the asset group down to its fair value if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2017  2016  or 2015  

depreciation and amortization expense   property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from three to 12 years for equipment and information systems and 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term 

lease accounting   when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows see recently issued accounting standards below 

insurance obligations   we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation general liability and employeerelated health care benefits our selfinsurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

stockbased compensation   we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards and account for forfeitures as incurred all stockbased compensation awards are expensed over the service and performance periods of the awards 

income taxes   we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures our policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 

recently issued accounting standards in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606    the guidance provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services asc 606 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2018 adoption will result in a change in the timing of recognizing revenue from breakage for stored value cards breakage will be estimated and recognized based upon the historical pattern of redemption rather than when redemption is considered remote additionally we will recognize allowances for estimated sales returns on a gross rather than net basis in our consolidated financial statements the impact of recognizing sales returns on a gross basis is not expected to be material we plan to adopt asc 606 under the modified retrospective method and will recognize a cumulativeeffect adjustment to increase retained earnings by approximately 20 million  net of income taxes as of february 4 2018 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases topic 842  the asu requires balance sheet recognition for all leases with lease terms greater than one year including a lease liability which is a lessee‘s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and a rightofuse asset which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term asu 201602 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2019 we are currently working on our adoption plan and evaluating the effect adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements due to the substantial number of leases that we have we believe this asu will increase assets and liabilities by the same material amount on our consolidated balance sheet our current undiscounted minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases is approximately 37 billion  we do not believe adoption of this asu will have a significant impact to our consolidated statements of earnings stockholders’ equity and cash flows 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash  asu 201618 requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows the standard also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows asu 201618 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2018 we do not believe adoption of this asu will have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements 

recently adopted accounting standards in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  asu 201609 provides for changes to accounting for stock compensation including 1 excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share based payment awards will be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the reporting period in which they occur previously such amounts were recognized in additional paidin capital 2 excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows and 3 the option to elect to estimate forfeitures or account for them when they occur the impact of recording excess tax benefits in income taxes in our consolidated statement of earnings may be material depending upon our future stock price on vest date in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date and our future grants of stockbased compensation 

we adopted asu 201609 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and elected to apply this adoption prospectively except for forfeitures which we adopted on a modified retrospective basis accordingly prior periods have not been adjusted as a result of adoption for the fiscal year ended february 3 2018 we recognized 163 million  of excess tax benefits related to stockbased payments as a reduction to our provision for income taxes these items were historically recorded in additional paidin capital we also presented cash flows related to excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows and elected to account for forfeitures as incurred beginning on january 29 2017 the impact of this accounting policy election for forfeitures was a cumulativeeffect adjustment to decrease retained earnings by 11 million  net of tax as of january 29 2017 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2017  and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd’s discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of february 3 2018  

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of february 3 2018  we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

we have two outstanding series of unsecured notes held by institutional investors series a senior notes due december 2018 for 85 million accrue interest at 638 and series b senior notes due december 2021 for 65 million accrue interest at 653 the amount outstanding under these notes as of february 3 2018  was 150 million we also have unsecured 3375 senior notes due september 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of 250 million interest that is payable on our senior notes is based on fixed interest rates and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates 

interest is receivable on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended february 3 2018  we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible nearterm changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion   stores—ross dress for less ®  “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  

ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1340  locations in 36 states the district of columbia and guam  as of january 28 2017  ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices every day ross target customers are primarily from middle income households 

we also operate 193  dd’s discounts stores in 15 states  as of january 28 2017  dds discounts features more moderatelypriced firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood and its target customers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than ross customers 

the merchant store field and distribution organizations for ross and dd’s discounts are separate and distinct the two chains share certain other corporate and support services 

both our ross and dds discounts brands target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are based on these customer profiles we believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

• maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store 

• meet customer needs on a local basis 

• deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer 

• manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 28 2017  january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  as fiscal 2016  fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  respectively all of which were 52week years 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brand name and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices every day at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising which emphasizes a strong value message our stores offer a treasurehunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item our merchandise offerings include but are not limited to apparel including footwear and accessories small furniture home accents bed and bath toys luggage gourmet food cookware watches and sporting goods 

purchasing we have a combined network of more than 8000  merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our six  distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on purchases 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at great values or can be stored as packaway merchandise 

packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2016  we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 49  and 47  of total inventories as of january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  respectively we believe the strong discounts we offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

our primary buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

at the end of fiscal 2016  we had approximately 760  merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct and each includes merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have on average eight  years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdales burlington stores foot locker kohl’s lord  taylor macys nordstrom saks and tjx we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in our merchant organization to further develop our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brand name product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers 

consistently low prices and compelling value on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

as of january 28 2017  we operated a total of 1533  stores comprised of 1340  ross stores and 193  dd’s discounts stores our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit we cluster ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management we do the same for dd’s discounts stores 

we believe a key element of our success at both ross and dd’s discounts is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasure hunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers at most stores shopping carts andor baskets are available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

we accept a variety of payment methods we provide refunds on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to do this are labor costs that are generally lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

information systems 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include enhancements to our information and data security merchandising distribution transportation and store systems these initiatives support future growth the execution and achievement of our plans as well as ongoing stability and compliance 

distribution 

we own and operate six   distribution processing facilities—three in california one in pennsylvania and two in south carolina we ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model 

currently we own four  and lease three  other warehouse facilities for packaway storage we also use other thirdparty facilities including two warehouses for storage of packaway inventory 

we utilize thirdparty cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support our current store growth information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

advertising 

advertising for ross dress for less relies primarily on television to communicate the ross value proposition—savings off the same brands carried at leading department or specialty stores every day this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position while television is our primary advertising medium we continue to utilize additional channels including social media to communicate our brand position advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local media initiatives 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross ®  ross dress for less ®  and dd’s discounts ®  have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of january 28 2017  we had approximately 78600  total employees which includes both full and parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customers and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization we also continue to make improvements to our core merchandising system to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are wellpositioned to compete based on each of these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources we also compete with online retailers that sell apparel and home fashions the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2016  and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain forwardlooking statements with respect to anticipated future events and our projected growth financial performance operations and competitive position that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our prior expectations and projections refer to management’s discussion and analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of “forwardlooking statements” 

our financial condition results of operations cash flows and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors risks and uncertainties that apply to both ross and dds discounts include without limitation the following 

competitive pressures in the apparel and homerelated merchandise retailing industry are high 

the retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store and online formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector we compete with many other local regional and national retailers traditional department stores upscale mass merchandisers other offprice retailers specialty stores internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce for customers associates store locations and merchandise our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing business strategies and promotional activity particularly during holiday periods in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition the substantial sales growth in the ecommerce industry within the last decade has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors new business models and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online offprice shopping alternatives intense pressures from our competitors our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape or a failure to effectively execute our offprice model could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins 

unexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and homerelated merchandise could adversely affect us 

our success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand we work on an ongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer needs it is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the multiple markets in which we operate throughout the united states although our offprice business model provides us certain advantages and could allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers in adjusting our merchandise mix to everchanging consumer tastes our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer trends and preferences particularly in our newer geographic markets failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends preferences and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and other merchandise 

unseasonable weather and prolonged extreme temperatures and events such as storms affect consumers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop and could adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise among other things weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or require us to close certain stores temporarily thereby reducing store traffic even if stores are not closed many customers may be unable to go or may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather as a result unseasonable weather in any of our markets could lead to disappointing sales and increase our markdowns which may negatively affect our sales and margins 

we are subject to impacts from the macroeconomic environment financial and credit markets and geopolitical conditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income 

consumer spending habits for the merchandise we sell are affected by many factors including prevailing economic conditions recession and fears of recession levels of unemployment salaries and wage rates housing costs energy and fuel costs income tax rates and the timing of tax refunds inflation consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer perceptions of personal wellbeing and security availability of consumer credit consumer debt levels and consumers’ disposable income adverse developments in any of these areas could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins all of our stores are located in the united states and its territories so we are especially susceptible to changes in the us economy     

in order to achieve our planned gross margins we must effectively manage our inventories markdowns and inventory shortage 

we purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans if our sales plans significantly differ from actual demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory resulting in decreased profit margins we also may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales opportunities as a regular part of our business we purchase “packaway” inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores varies by merchandise category and by season but it typically remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory if we make packaway purchases that do not meet consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores we could have significant inventory markdowns changes in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow although we have various systems to help protect against loss or theft of our inventory both when in storage and once distributed to our stores we may have damaged lost or stolen inventory called “shortage” in higher amounts than we forecast which would result in writeoffs lost sales and reduced margins 

we depend on the market availability quantity and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices 

opportunistic buying lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our offprice business strategy and maintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is key to our ability to attract customers and sustain our sales and gross margins our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion on our merchants who are in the marketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season our ability to meet or exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that we can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers to the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced to the extent that certain of our vendors decide not to sell to us or go out of business the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could also be materially reduced because a significant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries changes in us tariffs trade relationships or tax policies that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of imported goods could also result in disruptions to our existing supply relationships shortages or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality merchandise would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and margins 

information or data security breaches including cyberattacks on our transaction processing and computer information systems could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of customer credit card employee or other private and valuable information that we handle in the ordinary course of our business 

like other large retailers we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process transmit and store payment card and other personal and confidential information and to provide information or data security for those transactions some of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check approvals and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards are controlled by the banking and payment card industry not by us cyber criminals may attempt to penetrate our information systems to misappropriate customer or business information including but not limited to creditdebit card personnel or trade information despite security measures we have in place our facilities and systems or those of thirdparty service providers we utilize or connect to may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors phishing and similar fraudulent attacks or other similar events it is also possible that an associate within our company or a third party we do business with may purposefully or inadvertently cause a security breach involving such information the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals 

and advances in computer capabilities and remote access increases these risks a breach of our information or data security or our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a loss of personal or business information could result in damage to our reputation loss of customer confidence violation or alleged violation of applicable laws and expose us to civil claims litigation and regulatory action and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations 

disruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver product to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner 

various information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business we depend on the integrity and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores track inventory flow manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics generate performance and financial reports and support merchandising decisions 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace information processes and systems that are key to managing our business we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace the risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from new technology targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could damage our competitive position and adversely impact our business and results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system changes could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

our information systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as severe storms fires earthquakes floods acts of terrorism and design or usage errors by our employees or by third parties if our information systems or our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport merchandise to our stores or our distribution centers which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or increased supply chain costs such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters trade restrictions tariffs thirdparty strikes work stoppages or slowdowns shipping capacity constraints supply or shipping interruptions or costs or other factors beyond our control any such disruptions could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

we need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth 

successful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas we compete with other retailers and businesses for acceptable store locations for the purpose of identifying locations we rely in part on consumer demographics while we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations we recognize that this information cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy time frames for negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected cancellations we may not be able to open new stores or if opened operate those stores profitably construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results additionally we may not be able to renegotiate our current lease terms which could negatively impact our operating results new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability of other existing stores if we cannot acquire sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the economics of our new stores in various markets 

to achieve growth we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets 

our growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our offprice model in current markets and in new geographic regions there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets stores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction occupancy advertising or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets thereby affecting our overall profitability new markets may have competitive conditions consumer tastes 

and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may require us to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and retain qualified associates 

consumer problems or legal issues involving the quality safety or authenticity of products we sell could harm our reputation result in lost sales andor increase our costs 

various governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell these laws and regulations frequently change and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated because of our opportunistic buying strategy we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors that we have not dealt with before although our vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally rely on our vendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable product safety and other laws vendor noncompliance with consumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls make certain products unsalable or require us to incur significant compliance costs 

regardless of fault any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise particularly products such as food and children’s items issues with the authenticity of merchandise or our inability or that of our vendors to comply on a timely basis with such laws and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our reputation result in lost sales inventory writeoffs uninsured product liability or other legal claims penalties or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs 

an adverse outcome in various legal regulatory or tax matters could increase our costs 

as an ordinary part of our business we are involved in various legal proceedings regulatory reviews tax audits or other legal matters these may include lawsuits inquiries demands or other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and private plaintiffs including those relating to employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation securities real estate tort commercial consumer protection privacy product compliance and safety advertising comparative pricing intellectual property tax escheat and whistleblower claims we continue to be involved in a number of employmentrelated lawsuits including class actions which are primarily in california 

we are subject to federal state and local rules and regulations in the united states and to various international laws which change from time to time these legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business including the cost of health care workforce management and employee benefits minimum wages advertising comparative pricing importexport sourcing and manufacturing data protection intellectual property and others if we fail to comply or are alleged not to comply with any of these requirements we may be subject to fines settlements penalties or other costs we are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state and local tax authorities and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take 

significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for both legal claims and for taxes actual results may differ and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes in addition applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and those changes could have material effects on our reported operating results and financial condition 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

our reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry such an incident could also include alleged acts or omissions by or situations involving our suppliers or their contractors or subcontractors the use of social media platforms including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons continues to increase the availability of information whether correct or erroneous on social media platforms is virtually immediate as is its impact many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted the opportunity for dissemination of information including inaccurate information is seemingly limitless and readily available information concerning our company may be posted on such platforms at any time information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which could negatively impact sales diminish customer trust reduce employee morale and productivity and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified associates the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction   

we must continually attract train and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our offprice retail strategies 

like other retailers we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization management and other key areas many of our retail store associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or healthcare benefits 

any increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or if we fail to pay such higher wages may result in increased turnover excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding hiring and training new associates if we cannot hire enough qualified associates or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from thirdparty providers especially during our peak season our operations could be negatively impacted 

because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must also attract train and retain our key associates across the company including within our buying organization the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our growth operations or financial position 

we must effectively advertise and market our business 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of our stores although we use marketing and advertising programs to attract customers to our stores particularly through television our competitors may spend more or use different approaches which could provide them with a competitive advantage our advertising and other promotional programs may not be effective or may be perceived negatively or could require increased expenditures which could adversely affect sales or increase costs 

we are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell even when purchased domestically often as excess inventory sold to us by a domestic vendor is originally manufactured in other countries in addition we directly source a portion of the products sold in our stores from foreign vendors predominantly in asia including china we also buy product from foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors and manufacturers representatives although our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors 

to the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products any event causing a disruption of imports including the imposition of import restrictions war and acts of terrorism could adversely affect our business the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured if the instability affects the production or export of merchandise from those countries trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas or both applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us 

when we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer these risks and uncertainties include import duties and quotas compliance with antidumping regulations work stoppages economic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions including inflation and recession foreign government regulations employment and labor matters concerns relating to human rights working conditions and other issues in factories or countries where merchandise is produced transparency of sourcing and supply chains exposure on product warranty and intellectual property issues consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise wars and fears of war political unrest natural disasters regulations to address climate change and trade restrictions we cannot predict whether any of the countries from which our products are sourced or in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments or the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions 

we require our vendors for both import and domestic purchasing to adhere to various conduct compliance and other requirements including those relating to environmental employment and labor including wages and working conditions health safety and antibribery standards from time to time our vendors their contractors or their subcontractors may be alleged to not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing 

business in foreign markets and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation could subject us to claims and liability and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in us tax or tariff policy regarding apparel and homerelated merchandise produced in other countries could adversely affect our business 

the us government has indicated an intention to review and potentially to significantly change us tax and trade policies potential changes may include disallowance of the tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of significant tariffs on products imported into the us this exposes us to risks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise and creates increased uncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins 

a predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries changes in us tariffs quotas trade relationships or tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries are likely to increase our cost of goods andor increase our effective tax rate although such changes would have implications across the entire industry we may fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes in addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from those potential changes in us laws and policies as we make business decisions in the face of the uncertainty of those potential changes we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes miss out on business opportunities or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes these risks could adversely affect our revenues increase our effective tax rates and reduce our profitability 

we may experience volatility in revenues and earnings 

our business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and backtoschool seasons weather and other factors although our offprice business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers we may still experience unexpected decreases in sales from time to time which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins significant operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not adjust proportionately with our sales if sales in a certain period are lower than our plans we are generally not able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently which may impact our operating results 

a natural or manmade disaster in california or in another region where we have a concentration of stores offices or a distribution center could harm our business 

our corporate headquarters los angeles buying office three  operating distribution centers two  warehouses and approximately 24  of our stores are located in california natural or other disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes tornadoes floods or other extreme weather and climate conditions or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism or public health issues such as epidemics in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain or could shut down damage or destroy our stores or distribution facilities 

to support our continuing operations our new store and distribution center growth plans and our stock repurchase program and quarterly dividends we must maintain sufficient liquidity 

we depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities and to supply capital to finance our operations make capital expenditures and acquisitions manage our debt levels and return value to our stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support these activities our growth plans and our financial performance would be adversely affected if necessary to support our operations we could be forced to suspend our stock repurchase program andor discontinue payment of our quarterly cash dividends any failure to pay dividends or repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price 

we have borrowed on occasion to finance some of our activities if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns our operations cash flows and returns to stockholders could be adversely affected

our real estate strategy in 2017  is to primarily open stores in states where we currently operate to increase our market penetration and reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market we also expect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in 2017  important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the local trade area in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

the following table summarizes the locations of our stores by stateterritory as of january 28 2017  and january 30 2016

we believe that the resolution of our pending class action litigation and other currently pending legal and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry and believe our share gains over the past few years were driven mainly by continued focus on value by consumers our sales and earnings gains in 2016  continued to benefit from efficient execution of our offprice model throughout all areas of our business our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



stores   total stores open at the end of fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were 1533  1446  and 1362  respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  increased by 6  6  and 7  from the respective prior years our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2016  increased 09 billion  or 78  compared to the prior year  due to the opening of 87  net new stores during 2016  and a 4  increase in comparable store sales defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2015  increased 09 billion  or 81  compared to the prior year due to the opening of 84  net new stores during 2015  and a 4  increase in sales from comparable stores 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



we intend to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization diversify our merchandise mix and more fully develop our systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2016  increased 5968 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 87  net new stores during the year and a 4  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016  decreased approximately 55 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin a 10 basis point decrease in buying expenses and lower distribution and occupancy costs by five basis points each 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2015  increased 6389 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 84  net new stores during the year and a 4  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015  decreased approximately five basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 45 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin and five basis points of occupancy leverage this improvement was partially offset by a 35 basis point increase in distribution expenses related to infrastructure investments and higher freight costs of 10 basis points 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016  selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 1517 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 87  net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016  increased by approximately 15 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to higher wages 

for fiscal 2015  sga increased 1234 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 84  net new stores and the impact of wage rate increases during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015  decreased by approximately five basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage resulting from the 4  increase in comparable store sales 

interest expense income net  in fiscal 2016  net interest expense increased by 39 million  primarily due to a reduction of capitalized interest partially offset by an increase in interest income as a percentage of sales net interest expense in fiscal 2016  remained flat compared to the prior year the table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



taxes on earnings our effective tax rates for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were approximately 37  37  and 38  respectively the effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is impacted by changes in laws location of new stores level of earnings and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017  will be between 37 and 38 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016  were higher than fiscal 2015  primarily due to lower cost of goods sold partially offset by higher sga expenses net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015  were higher compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses 

earnings per share  diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016  was 283  compared to 251  in the prior year the 13  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an increase of approximately 10  in net earnings and a 3  reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015  was 251  compared to 221  in fiscal 2014  the 14  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an increase of approximately 10  in net earnings and a 4 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll rent taxes and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores and investments in distribution centers information systems and buying and corporate offices we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 15589 million  13262 million  and 13728 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns 

the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily driven by higher earnings the timing of receipts and related payments versus last year and by higher income taxes payable the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year resulted in higher accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory which was 68  67  and 73  as of january 28 2017  january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively 

the decrease in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily driven by the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year partially offset by higher earnings 

as a regular part of our business packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers 

changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow at the end of fiscal 2016  packaway inventory was 49  of total inventory compared to 47  and 45  at the end of fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 2928 million  3625 million  and 6390 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  was primarily due to a reduction in our capital expenditures 

in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  our capital expenditures were 2979 million  3670 million  and 6467 million  respectively our capital expenditures include costs to build expand and improve distribution centers open new stores and improve existing stores and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems buying and corporate offices the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the completion in 2015 of the rollout of new point of sale equipment in our stores and construction of a distribution center the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the purchase in september 2014 of our new york buying office and the construction of two distribution centers we opened 93  90  and 95  new stores in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 



we are forecasting approximately 400 million  in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017  to fund costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new ross and dd’s discounts stores the upgrade or relocation of existing stores investments in information technology systems and for various other expenditures related to our stores distribution centers buying and corporate offices we expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations 

we had no  purchases of investments in fiscal 2016  and 2014  and 07 million  of purchases of investments in fiscal 2015  we had proceeds from investments of 17 million  11 million  and 120 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 9161 million  8987 million  and 4604 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively during fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations and in fiscal 2014 the issuance of our unsecured 3375 senior notes due september 2024 2024 notes 

in september 2014 we issued 250 million of unsecured 2024 notes and used most of the net proceeds of approximately 246 million to purchase our new york buying office building for 222 million and the remaining 24 million for other general corporate purposes 

we repurchased 116 million  137 million  and 148 million  shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 700 million  700 million  and 550 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we also acquired 07 million  13 million  and 11 million  shares in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively of treasury stock from our employee stock equity compensation programs for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 433 million  689 million  and 390 million  during fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively

during fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  we paid dividends of 2146 million  1923 million  and 1685 million  respectively 

shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit bank lines and other credit sources to meet our capital and liquidity requirements including lease payment obligations in 2017  

in april 2016 we entered into a new 600 million  unsecured revolving credit facility this credit facility which replaced our previous 600 million  unsecured revolving credit facility expires in april 2021  and contains a 300 million  sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit subject to increase in proportion to any increase in the size of the credit facility the facility also contains an option allowing us to increase the size of our revolving credit facility by up to an additional 200 million with the agreement of the lenders interest on any borrowings under this facility is based on libor plus 

an applicable margin currently 100 basis points and is payable quarterly and upon maturity the revolving credit facility may be extended at our option for up to two additional one year periods subject to customary conditions as of january 28 2017  we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding on this facility and our 600 million credit facility remains in place and available 

the revolving credit facility is subject to a financial leverage ratio covenant as of january 28 2017  we were in compliance with this covenant 

we estimate that existing cash balances cash flows from operations bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital investments common stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months

the table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of january 28 2017  



1 we have a 975 million  liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is included in other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets this liability is excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated

offbalance sheet arrangements 

operating leases  we currently lease all but three of our store locations three warehouse facilities and a buying office in addition we have a ground lease related to our new york buying office except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment these leased locations do not represent longterm capital investments 

two of the warehouses are in carlisle pennsylvania with leases expiring in 2018  and 2019  the third warehouse is in fort mill south carolina with a lease expiring in 2019 the leases for the two carlisle pennsylvania warehouses contain renewal provisions

other 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 

in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

merchandise inventory   our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weighted average basis or net realizable value we purchase inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to the company’s store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory accounted for approximately 49  47  and 45  of total inventories as of january 28 2017  january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets   we review for a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group an impairment loss would be recognized to write the asset group down to its fair value if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014  

depreciation and amortization expense   property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from three to 12 years for equipment and information systems and 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term 

lease accounting   when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows see recently issued accounting standards below 

insurance obligations   we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation general liability and employeerelated health care benefits our selfinsurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

stockbased compensation   we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards we use historical data to estimate prevesting forfeitures and to recognize stockbased compensation expense all stockbased compensation awards are expensed over the service and performance periods of the awards 

income taxes   we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures our policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 

recently issued accounting standards in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606    the guidance provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2018 we do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to be material to our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases topic 842  the asu requires balance sheet recognition for all leases with lease terms greater than one year including a lease liability which is a lessee‘s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and a rightofuse asset which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term asu 201602 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2019 we are currently evaluating the effect adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements due to the substantial number of leases that we have we believe this asu will increase assets and liabilities by the same material amount on our consolidated balance sheet see note e for disclosure of our current undiscounted minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases we do not believe adoption of this asu will have a significant impact to our consolidated statements of earnings stockholders’ equity and cash flows 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  asu 201609 provides for changes to accounting for stock compensation including 1 excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share based payment awards will be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the reporting period in which they occur previously such amounts were recognized in additional paidin capital 2 excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows and 3 the option to elect to estimate forfeitures or account for them when they occur asu 201609 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017 upon adoption of asu 201609 we plan to account for forfeitures as incurred and expect this adoption along with the retrospective impact on our classification of cash flows between operating and financing activities to be immaterial we believe the impact of recording excess tax benefits in income taxes in our consolidated statement of earnings may be material the magnitude of such impact is dependent upon our future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date and our future grants of stockbased compensation see note f for disclosure of our historical accounting treatment of excess tax benefits 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash  asu 201618 requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows the standard also requires 

companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows asu 201618 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2018 we do not believe adoption of this asu will have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2016  and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dds discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of january 28 2017  

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 28 2017  we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

we have two outstanding series of unsecured notes held by institutional investors series a senior notes due december 2018 for 85 million accrue interest at 638 and series b senior notes due december 2021 for 65 million accrue interest at 653 the amount outstanding under these notes as of january 28 2017  was 150 million we also have unsecured 3375 senior notes due september 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of 250 million interest that is payable on our senior notes is based on fixed interest rates and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates 

interest is receivable on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended january 28 2017  we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible nearterm changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion   stores—ross dress for less ®  “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  

ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1274  locations in 34 states the district of columbia and guam  as of january 30 2016  ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices every day ross target customers are primarily from middle income households 

we also operate 172  dd’s discounts stores in 15 states  as of january 30 2016  dds discounts features more moderatelypriced firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood and its target customers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than ross customers 

the merchant store field and distribution organizations for ross and dd’s discounts are separate and distinct the two chains share certain other corporate and support services 

both our ross and dds discounts brands target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are based on these customer profiles we believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

• maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store 

• meet customer needs on a local basis 

• deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer 

• manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 30 2016  january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  as fiscal 2015  fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  respectively all of which were 52week years 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brand name and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices every day at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising which emphasizes a strong value message our stores offer a treasurehunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item our merchandise offerings include but are not limited to apparel including footwear and accessories small furniture home accents bed and bath toys luggage gourmet food cookware watches and sporting goods 

purchasing we have a combined network of approximately 8300  merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our six  distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at great values or can be stored as packaway merchandise 

packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2015  we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 47  and 45  of total inventories as of january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively we believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

our primary buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

at the end of fiscal 2015  we had approximately 730  merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct and each includes merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have on average eight  years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdales burlington stores foot locker kohl’s loehmann’s lord  taylor macys nordstrom saks and tjx we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in our merchant organization to further develop our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brand name product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

as of january 30 2016  we operated a total of 1446  stores comprised of 1274  ross stores and 172  dd’s discounts stores our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit we cluster ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management we do the same for dd’s discounts stores 

we believe a key element of our success at both ross and dd’s discounts is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasure hunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers at most stores shopping carts andor baskets are available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

we accept a variety of payment methods we provide refunds on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to do this are labor costs that are generally lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

information systems 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include enhancements to our data security merchandising distribution transportation and store systems these initiatives support future growth the execution and achievement of our plans as well as ongoing stability and compliance 

distribution 

we own and operate six   distribution processing facilities—three in california one in pennsylvania and two in south carolina we ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model 

currently we own four  and lease three  other warehouse facilities for packaway storage we also use other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory 

we utilize thirdparty cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support our current store growth information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

advertising 

advertising for ross dress for less relies primarily on television to communicate the ross value proposition— savings off the same brands carried at leading department or specialty stores every day this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position while television is our primary advertising medium we continue to utilize additional channels including social media to communicate our brand position advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local media initiatives 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross dress for less ®  and dd’s discounts ®  have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of january 30 2016  we had approximately 77800  total employees which includes both full and parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customers and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization we also continue to make improvements to our core merchandising system to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are wellpositioned to compete based on each of these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources we also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home fashions through catalogs or online the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2015  and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain forwardlooking statements with respect to anticipated future events and our projected growth financial performance operations and competitive position that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our prior expectations and projections refer to management’s discussion and analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of “forwardlooking statements” 

our financial condition results of operations cash flows and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors risks and uncertainties that apply to both ross and dds discounts include without limitation the following 

competitive pressures in the apparel and homerelated merchandise retailing industry are high 

the retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector we compete with many other local regional and national retailers traditional department stores upscale mass merchandisers other offprice retailers specialty stores internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce for customers associates store locations and merchandise our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing business strategies and promotional activity particularly during holiday periods in response to changing conditions the substantial sales growth in the ecommerce industry within the last decade has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors new business models and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online offprice shopping alternatives intense pressures from our competitors our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape or a failure to effectively execute our offprice model could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins 

unexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and homerelated merchandise 

our success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand we work on an ongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer needs it is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the multiple markets in which we operate throughout the united states although our offprice business model provides us certain advantages and could allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers in adjusting our merchandise mix to everchanging consumer tastes our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer trends and preferences particularly in our newer geographic markets failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends preferences and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and other merchandise 

unseasonable weather and prolonged extreme temperatures and events such as storms affect consumers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop and could adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise among other things weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or require us to close certain stores temporarily thereby reducing store traffic even if stores are not closed many customers may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather as a result unseasonable weather in any of our markets could lead to disappointing sales and increase our markdowns which may negatively affect our sales and margins 

we are subject to impacts from the macroeconomic environment financial and credit markets and geopolitical conditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income 

consumer spending habits for the merchandise we sell are affected by many factors including prevailing economic conditions recession and fears of recession levels of unemployment salaries and wage rates housing costs energy and fuel costs income tax rates and the timing of tax refunds inflation consumer confidence in future economic conditions consumer perceptions of personal wellbeing and security availability of consumer credit consumer debt levels and consumers’ disposable income adverse developments in any of these areas could reduce demand for our merchandise decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins all of our stores are located in the united states so we are especially susceptible to changes in the us economy     

in order to achieve our planned gross margins we must effectively manage our inventories markdowns and inventory shortage 

we purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans if our sales plans significantly differ from actual demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory resulting in decreased profit margins we also may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales opportunities as a regular part of our business we purchase “packaway” inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores varies by merchandise category and by season but it typically remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory if we make packaway purchases that do not meet consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores we could have significant inventory markdowns changes in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow although we have various systems to help protect against loss or theft of our inventory both when in storage and once distributed to our stores we may have damaged lost or stolen inventory called “shortage” in higher amounts than we forecast which would result in writeoffs lost sales and reduced margins 

we depend on the market availability quantity and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices 

opportunistic buying lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our offprice business strategy and maintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is key to our ability to attract customers and sustain our sales and gross margins our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion on our merchants who are in the marketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season our ability to meet or exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that we can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers to the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced shortages or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality merchandise would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and margins 

data security breaches including cyberattacks on our transaction processing and computer information systems could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of customer credit card employee or other private and valuable information that we handle in the ordinary course of our business 

like other large retailers we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process transmit and store payment card and other personal and confidential information and to provide data security for those transactions some of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check approvals and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards are controlled by the banking and payment card industry not by us cyber criminals may attempt to penetrate our information systems to misappropriate customer or business information including but not limited to creditdebit card personnel or trade information despite security measures we have in place our facilities and systems or those of thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events it is also possible that an associate within our company or a third party we do business with may purposefully or inadvertently cause a security breach involving such information the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and advances in computer capabilities and remote access increases these risks a breach of our data security or our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a loss of personal or business information could result in damage to our reputation loss of customer confidence violation or alleged violation of applicable laws and expose us to civil claims litigation and regulatory action and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations 

disruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver product to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner 

various information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business we depend on the integrity and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores track inventory flow manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics generate performance and financial reports and support merchandising decisions 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace information processes and systems that are key to managing our business we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace the risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from new technology targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could damage our competitive position and adversely impact our business and results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system changes could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

our information systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as severe storms fires earthquakes floods acts of terrorism and design or usage errors by our employees or by third parties if our information systems or our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport merchandise to our stores or our distribution centers which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or increased supply chain costs such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers weatherrelated events natural disasters trade restrictions tariffs thirdparty strikes work stoppages or slowdowns shipping capacity constraints supply or shipping interruptions or costs or other factors beyond our control any such disruptions could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition 

we need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth 

successful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas we compete with other retailers and businesses for acceptable store locations for the purpose of identifying locations we rely in part on consumer demographics while we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations we recognize that this information cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy time frames for negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected cancellations we may not be able to open new stores or if opened operate those stores profitably construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results additionally we may not be able to renegotiate our current lease terms which could negatively impact our operating results new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability of other existing stores if we cannot acquire sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the economics of our new stores in various markets 

to achieve growth we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets 

our growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our offprice model in current markets and in new geographic regions there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets stores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction occupancy advertising or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets thereby affecting our overall profitability new markets may have competitive conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may require us to build brand awareness in that 

market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and retain qualified associates 

consumer problems or legal issues involving the quality safety or authenticity of products we sell 

various governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell these laws and regulations frequently change and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated because of our opportunistic buying strategy we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors that we have not dealt with before although our vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally rely on our vendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable product safety and other laws vendor noncompliance with consumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls make certain products unsalable or require us to incur significant compliance costs 

but regardless of fault any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise particularly products such as food and children’s items issues with the authenticity of merchandise or our inability or that of our vendors to comply on a timely basis with such laws and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our reputation result in lost sales inventory writeoffs uninsured product liability or other legal claims penalties or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs 

an adverse outcome in various legal regulatory or tax matters could increase our costs 

as an ordinary part of our business we are involved in various legal proceedings regulatory reviews tax audits or other legal matters these may include lawsuits inquiries demands and other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and private plaintiffs including those relating to employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation securities real estate tort consumer protection privacy product compliance and safety advertising comparative pricing intellectual property tax escheat and whistleblower claims we continue to be involved in a number of employmentrelated lawsuits including class actions in california 

we are subject to federal state and local rules and regulations in the united states and to various international laws which change from time to time these legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business including the cost of health care workforce management and employee benefits minimum wages advertising comparative pricing importexport sourcing and manufacturing data protection intellectual property and others if we fail to comply or are alleged not to comply with any of these requirements we may be subject to fines settlements penalties or other costs we are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state and local tax authorities and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take 

significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for both legal claims and for taxes actual results may differ and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes in addition applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and those changes could have material effects on our reported operating results and financial condition 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

our reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry the use of social media platforms and similar devices including blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons continues to increase the availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate as is its impact many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted the opportunity for dissemination of information including inaccurate information is seemingly limitless and readily available information concerning our company may be posted on such platforms at any time information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which could negatively impact sales diminish customer trust reduce employee morale and productivity and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified associates the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction   

we must continually attract train and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our offprice retail strategies 

like other retailers we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization management and other key areas many of our retail store associates are in entry level or parttime positions with 

historically high rates of turnover our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or healthcare benefits 

any increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or if we fail to pay such higher wages may result in increased turnover excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding hiring and training new associates if we cannot hire enough qualified associates or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from thirdparty providers especially during our peak season our operations could be negatively impacted 

because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must also attract train and retain our key associates across the company including within our buying organization the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our growth operations and financial position 

we must effectively advertise and market our business 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of our stores although we use marketing and advertising programs to attract customers to our stores particularly though television our competitors may spend more or use different approaches which could prove to provide them with a competitive advantage our advertising and other promotional programs may not be effective or may be perceived negatively or could require increased expenditures which could adversely affect sales or increase costs 

we are subject to risks associated with importing merchandise from other countries 

a portion of the products sold in our stores is sourced from foreign vendors predominantly in asia including china we also buy product from foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors although our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors 

to the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products any event causing a disruption of imports including the imposition of import restrictions war and acts of terrorism could adversely affect our business the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured if the instability affects the production or export of merchandise from those countries trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas or both applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us 

when we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer these risks and uncertainties include import duties and quotas compliance with antidumping regulations work stoppages economic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions including inflation and recession foreign government regulations employment and labor matters concerns relating to human rights working conditions and other issues in factories or countries where merchandise is produced transparent sourcing and supply chains exposure for product warranty and intellectual property issues consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise wars and fears of war political unrest natural disasters regulations to address climate change and other trade restrictions we cannot predict whether any of the countries from which our products are sourced or in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments or the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions 

we require our vendors to adhere to various conduct compliance and other requirements including those relating to environmental employment and labor health safety and antibribery standards from time to time our vendors their contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation could subject us to claims and liability and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may experience volatility in revenues and earnings 

our business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and backtoschool seasons weather and other factors although our offprice business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers we may still experience unexpected decreases in sales from time to time which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins significant operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not adjust proportionately with our sales if sales in a certain period are lower than our plans we are generally not able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently which may impact our operating results 

a natural or manmade disaster in california or in another region where we have a concentration of stores offices or a distribution center could harm our business 

our corporate headquarters los angeles buying office three  operating distribution centers two  warehouses and approximately 24  of our stores are located in california natural or other disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes tornadoes floods or other extreme weather and climate conditions or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism or public health issues such as epidemics in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain or could shut down damage or destroy our stores or distribution facilities 

to support our continuing operations our new store and distribution center growth plans and our stock repurchase program and quarterly dividends we must maintain sufficient liquidity 

we depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities and to supply capital to finance our operations make capital expenditures and acquisitions manage our debt levels and return value to our stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support these activities our growth plans and our financial performance would be adversely affected if necessary to support our operations we could be forced to suspend our stock repurchase program andor discontinue payment of our quarterly cash dividends any failure to pay dividends or repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price 

we have borrowed on occasion to finance some of our activities if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns our operations cash flows and returns to stockholders could be adversely affected

our real estate strategy in 2016  is to primarily open stores in states where we currently operate to increase our market penetration and reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market we also expect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in 2016  important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the local trade area in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

the following table summarizes the locations of our stores by stateterritory as of january 30 2016  and january 31 2015

overview

stores in 15 states  as of january 30 2016  that feature a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry and believe our share gains over the past few years were driven mainly by continued focus on value by consumers our sales and earnings gains in 2015  continued to benefit from efficient execution of our offprice model throughout all areas of our business our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 30 2016  january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  as fiscal 2015  fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  respectively 

all share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the twoforone stock split effective june 11 2015 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  



stores   total stores open at the end of fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were 1446  1362  and 1276  respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  increased by 6  7  and 6  from the respective prior years our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2015  increased 09 billion  or 81  compared to the prior year  due to the opening of 84  net new stores during 2015  and a 4  increase in comparable store sales defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2014  increased 08 billion  or 79  compared to the prior year due to the opening of 86  net new stores during 2014  and a 3  increase in sales from comparable stores 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  



we intend to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization diversify our merchandise mix and more fully develop our systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2015  increased 6389 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 84  net new stores during the year and a 4  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015  decreased approximately five basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 45 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin and five basis points of occupancy leverage this improvement was partially offset by a 35 basis point increase in distribution expenses related to our recent infrastructure investments and higher freight costs of 10 basis points 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2014  increased 5770 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 86  net new stores during the year and a 3  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2014  decreased approximately five basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 20 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin this improvement was partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in buying costs 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015  selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 1234 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 84  net new stores and the impact of wage rate increases during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015  decreased by approximately five basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage resulting from the 4  increase in comparable store sales 

for fiscal 2014  sga increased 890 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 86  net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2014  decreased by approximately 30 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to tight expense control 

interest expense income net  in fiscal 2015  net interest expense increased by 96 million  and rose as a percentage of sales primarily due to the issuance of our unsecured 3375  senior notes due september 2024  in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and the reduction of capitalized interest the table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  



taxes on earnings our effective tax rates for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were approximately 37  38  and 38  respectively the effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is impacted by changes in laws location of new stores level of earnings and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016  will be between 37 and 38 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015  were higher than fiscal 2014  primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2014  were higher compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses 

earnings per share  diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015  was 251  compared to 221  in the prior year period the 14  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 10  increase in net earnings and a 4 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014  was 221  compared to 194  in fiscal 2013  the 14  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 10  increase in net earnings and a 4 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll rent taxes and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores and investments in distribution centers information systems and buying and corporate offices we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 13262 million 13728 million and 10220 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns 

the decrease in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  was primarily driven by the changes in packaway inventory levels and the timing of packaway receipts versus last year partially offset by higher earnings changes in packaway inventory levels and the timing of packaway receipts and related payments versus last year resulted in lower accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory which was 67  73  and 62  as of january 30 2016  january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  respectively accounts payable leverage at the end of fiscal 2013 was also impacted due to the timing shift of the dividend declaration from january 2014 to february 2014 

the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  was primarily due to higher net earnings and an increase in accounts payable leverage 

as a regular part of our business packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers 

changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow at the end of fiscal 2015  packaway inventory was 47  of total inventory compared to 45  and 49  at the end of fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 3625 million  6390 million  and 5638 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  was primarily due to a reduction in our capital expenditures 

in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  our capital expenditures were 3670 million  6467 million  and 5505 million  respectively our capital expenditures include costs to build or expand distribution centers open new stores and improve existing stores and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems buying and corporate offices the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  was primarily due to the purchase in september 2014 of our new york buying office and the construction of two distribution centers we opened 90  95  and 88  new stores in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 



we are forecasting approximately 425 million  in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016  to fund costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new ross and dd’s discounts stores the upgrade or relocation of existing 

stores investments in information technology systems and for various other expenditures related to our stores distribution centers buying and corporate offices we expect to primarily fund capital expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations 

we had purchases of investments in fiscal 2015  and 2013  of 07 million  and 120 million  respectively we had no purchases of investments in fiscal 2014  we had proceeds from investments of 11 million  120 million  and 16 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 8987 million  4604 million  and 6818 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations and in fiscal 2014 the issuance of our unsecured 3375 senior notes due september 2024 2024 notes 

in september 2014 we issued 250 million of unsecured 2024 notes and used most of the net proceeds of approximately 246 million to purchase our new york buying office building for 222 million and the remaining 24 million for other general corporate purposes 

we repurchased 137 million  148 million  and 164 million  shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 700 million  550 million  and 550 million  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively we also acquired 13 million  11 million  and 10 million  shares in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively of treasury stock from our employee stock equity compensation programs for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 689 million  390 million  and 299 million  during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively in february 2015 our board of directors approved a twoyear 14 billion stock repurchase program for fiscal 2015 and 2016

during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  we paid dividends of 1923 million  1685 million  and 1479 million  respectively 

shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit bank lines and other credit sources to meet our capital and liquidity requirements including lease payment obligations in 2016  

our existing 600 million unsecured revolving credit facility expires in june 2017 and contains a 300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit interest on this facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin currently 100 basis points and is payable quarterly and upon maturity as of january 30 2016  we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding on this facility and our 600 million credit facility remains in place and available we plan to renew our revolving credit facility in 2016 

we estimate that existing cash balances cash flows from operations bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital investments common stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months 

contractual obligations 

the table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of january 30 2016

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 

in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

merchandise inventory   our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weighted average basis or net realizable value we purchase inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to the company’s store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory accounted for approximately 47  45  and 49  of total inventories as of january 30 2016  january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  respectively merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets   we review for a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group an impairment loss would be recognized to write the asset group down to its fair value if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  

depreciation and amortization expense   property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from three to 12 years for equipment and information systems and 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term 

lease accounting   when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows see recently issued accounting standards below 

insurance obligations   we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation general liability and employeerelated health care benefits our selfinsurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care 

increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

stockbased compensation   we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards we use historical data to estimate prevesting forfeitures and to recognize stockbased compensation expense all stockbased compensation awards are expensed over the service and performance periods of the awards 

income taxes   we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures our policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 

recently issued accounting standards in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers    the guidance provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2018 we are currently evaluating the effect adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 201602 leases topic 842 the guidance requires balance sheet recognition for all leases with lease terms greater than one year including a lease liability which is a lessee‘s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and a rightofuse asset which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term asu 201602 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2019 we are currently evaluating the effect adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 

recently issued and adopted accounting standards in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  the standard amends existing guidance to require the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of as an asset asu 201503 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods after december 15 2015 with early adoption permitted we early adopted asu 201503 retrospectively in our first fiscal quarter ended may 2 2015 as a result we reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs of 28 million as of january 31 2015 from other longterm assets to a reduction in longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet adoption of this standard did not impact results of operations retained earnings or cash flows in the current or previous interim and annual reporting periods 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  which simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet asu 201517 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods after december 15 2016 with early adoption permitted we early adopted asu 201517 retrospectively as of january 30 2016 as a result 130 million of our deferred tax assets previously presented in current assets have been reclassified to long term deferred tax liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of january 31 2015 adoption of this standard did not impact results of operations retained earnings or cash flows in the current or previous annual reporting periods 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2015  and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dds discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of january 30 2016  

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 30 2016  we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

we have two outstanding series of unsecured notes held by institutional investors series a senior notes due december 2018 for 85 million accrue interest at 638 and series b senior notes due december 2021 for 65 million accrue interest at 653 the amount outstanding under these notes as of january 30 2016  was 150 million we also have unsecured 3375 senior notes due september 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of 250 million interest that is payable on our senior notes is based on fixed interest rates and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates 

interest is receivable on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended january 30 2016  we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible nearterm changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion   stores—ross dress for less ®  “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  

ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1210  locations in 33 states the district of columbia and guam  as of january 31 2015  ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices every day ross target customers are primarily from middle income households 

we also operate 152  dd’s discounts stores in 15 states  as of january 31 2015  dds discounts features more moderatelypriced firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood and its target customers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than ross customers 

the merchant store and distribution organizations for ross and dd’s discounts are separate and distinct the two chains share certain other corporate and support services 

both our ross and dds discounts brands target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are based on these customer profiles we believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

• maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store 

• meet customer needs on a local basis 

• deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer 

• manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 31 2015  february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  as fiscal 2014  fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  respectively fiscal 2014  and 2013  were each 52week years fiscal 2012  was a 53week year 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brand name and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices every day at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising which emphasizes a strong value message our stores offer a treasurehunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item the mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal 2014  was approximately as follows ladies   29  home accents and bed and bath   24  accessories lingerie fine jewelry and fragrances   13  mens   13  shoes   

13  and childrens   8  these merchandise offerings include but are not limited to small furniture and furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware watches and sporting goods 

purchasing we have a combined network of approximately 8200  merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe that our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our five distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout and packaway purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2014  we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 45  and 49  of total inventories as of january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  respectively and reflects our merchants’ continued ability to take advantage of a large amount of closeout opportunities in the marketplace we believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

our primary buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

over the past year we continued to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization to further enhance our ability to deliver name brand bargains to our customers at the end of fiscal 2014  we had approximately 700  merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct and each includes merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have on average eight  years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdales burlington stores foot locker kohl’s loehmann’s lord  taylor macys nordstrom saks and tjx we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in new merchants to further develop our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brand name product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department and 

specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

as of january 31 2015  we operated a total of 1362  stores comprised of 1210  ross stores and 152  dd’s discounts stores our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit we cluster ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management we do the same for dd’s discounts stores 

we believe a key element of our success at both ross and dd’s discounts is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasure hunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers at most stores shopping carts and  or baskets are available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

we accept a variety of payment methods we provide refunds on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to do this are labor costs that are generally lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

information systems 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include enhancements to our merchandise planning core merchandising allocation management and store pointofsale and store labor management systems these initiatives support our expansion in both new and existing markets and our assortment execution and plan achievement while also supporting future growth 

distribution 

we own and operate five   distribution processing facilities – two in california one in pennsylvania and two in south carolina we ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model an additional distribution center in shafter california is currently under construction and expected to open in 2015 

currently we own four  and lease three  other warehouse facilities for packaway storage we also use other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory 

we also utilize thirdparty cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support our current store growth information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

advertising 

advertising for ross dress for less relies primarily on television to communicate the ross value proposition— savings off the same brands carried at leading department stores every day this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position while television is our primary advertising medium we continue to utilize additional channels to communicate our brand position advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local media initiatives 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross dress for less ®  and dd’s discounts ®  have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of january 31 2015  we had approximately 71400  total employees which includes both full and parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customers and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization we also continue to make improvements to our core merchandising system to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are wellpositioned to compete based on each of these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources we also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home fashions through catalogs or online the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future

our real estate strategy in 2015  is to open stores in states where we currently operate to increase our market penetration and reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market we also expect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in 2015  important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the local trade area in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

the following table summarizes the locations of our stores by stateterritory as of january 31 2015  and february 1 2014

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

ross stores inc operates two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion stores—ross dress for less ®  “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1210  locations in 33 states the district of columbia and guam  as of january 31 2015  ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices every day we also operate 152  dd’s discounts stores in 15 states  as of january 31 2015  that feature a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry and believe our share gains over the past few years were driven mainly by continued focus on value by consumers our sales and earnings gains in 2014  continued to benefit from efficient execution of our offprice model throughout all areas of our business our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 31 2015  february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  as fiscal 2014  fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  respectively fiscal 2014  and 2013  were 52week years fiscal 2012  was a 53week year 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  



¹ fiscal 2012 was a 53week year all other fiscal years presented were 52 weeks 

stores   total stores open at the end of fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  were 1362  1276  and 1199  respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  increased by 7  6  and 7  from the respective prior years our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2014  increased 08 billion  or 79  compared to the prior year  due to the opening of 86  net new stores during 2014  and a 3  increase in comparable store sales defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2013  increased 05 billion  or 52  compared to the prior year due to the opening of 77  net new stores during 2013  and a 3  increase in sales from comparable stores 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  



we intend to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization diversify our merchandise mix and more fully develop our systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2014  increased 5770 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 86  net new stores during the year and a 3  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2014  decreased approximately 5 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 20 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin this improvement was partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in buying costs 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2013  increased 3495 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 77  net new stores during the year and a 3  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2013  decreased approximately 15 basis points from the prior year this improvement was due primarily to a 45 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin which was partially offset by increases in occupancy of about 20 basis points and increases in distribution and buying expenses of about 5 basis points each 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014  selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 890 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 86  net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2014  decreased by approximately 30 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to tight expense control 

for fiscal 2013  sga increased 885 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 77  net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2013  increased by approximately 15 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to higher costs related to the relocation of our data center 

the largest component of sga is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime as of fiscal year end 2014  2013  and 2012  was approximately 71400  66300  and 57500  respectively 

interest expense income net  in fiscal 2014  net interest expense increased by 32 million  primarily due to the issuance of our unsecured 3375  senior notes due september 2024  as a percentage of sales net interest expense in fiscal 2014  increased by approximately five basis points compared to the same period in the prior year the table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  



taxes on earnings our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  was approximately 38  in each year which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is impacted by changes in laws location of new stores level of earnings and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015  will be between 37 and 38 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2014  were higher than fiscal 2013  primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2013  were higher compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to lower cost of goods sold partially offset by higher sga expenses 

earnings per share  diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014  was 442  compared to 388  in the prior year period the 14  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 10  increase in net earnings and a 4 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013  was 388  compared to 353  in fiscal 2012  the 10  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 6  increase in net earnings and a 4 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll rent taxes and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores and investments in distribution centers information systems and buying and corporate offices we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 13728 million 10220 million  and 9796 million  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns 

net cash from operations increased in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to higher net earnings and an increase in accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory the change in accounts payable net of the change in merchandise inventory resulted in a source of cash of approximately 89 million  in fiscal 2014  compared to a use of cash of approximately 52 million  and 39 million  for fiscal 2013  and 2012  respectively 

accounts payable leverage was 73  62  and 67  as of january 31 2015  february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  respectively changes in accounts payable leverage are primarily driven by the levels and timing of inventory receipts and payments accounts payable leverage at the end of fiscal 2013 was also impacted due to the timing shift of the dividend declaration from january 2014 to february 2014 

as a regular part of our business packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers 

changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow at the end of fiscal 2014  packaway inventory was 45  of total inventory compared to 49  and 47  at the end of fiscal 2013  and 2012  respectively 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 6390 million  5638 million  and 4257 million  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the increases in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  were primarily due to increases in our capital expenditures 

in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  our capital expenditures were 6467 million  5505 million  and 4244 million  respectively our capital expenditures include costs to build or expand distribution centers open new stores and improve existing stores and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems buying and corporate offices we opened 95  88  and 82  new stores in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively in september 2014 we completed the purchase of the office building where our new york buying office is located for 222 million 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 



we are forecasting approximately 450 million  in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015  to fund costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new ross and dd’s discounts stores the upgrade or relocation of existing stores investments in information technology systems and for various other expenditures related to our stores distribution centers buying and corporate offices we expect to primarily fund capital expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations 

we had no purchases of investments in fiscal 2014  and purchases of 120 million  and 54 million  in fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  respectively we had proceeds from investments of 120 million  16 million  and 62 million  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 4604 million  6818 million  and 5570 million  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations and in fiscal 2014 the issuance of our unsecured 3375 senior notes due september 2024 2024 notes

shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit bank lines and other credit sources to meet our capital and liquidity requirements including lease payment obligations in 2015

other 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory   our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weighted average basis or net realizable value we purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to the company’s store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory accounted for approximately 45  49  and 47  of total inventories as of january 31 2015  february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  respectively merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the 

merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets   we review for a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group an impairment loss would be recognized to write the asset group down to its fair value if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  

depreciation and amortization expense   property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from three to 12 years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term 

lease accounting   when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

insurance obligations   we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation general liability and employeerelated health care benefits our selfinsurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

stockbased compensation   we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards we use historical data to estimate prevesting forfeitures and to recognize stockbased compensation expense all stockbased compensation awards are expensed over the service or performance periods of the awards 

income taxes   we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures our policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 

the critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

recently issued accounting standards in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers    the guidance provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2017 we are currently evaluating the effect adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2014  and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict as a result our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dds discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of january 31 2015  

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 31 2015  we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

we have two outstanding series of unsecured notes held by institutional investors series a senior notes due december 2018 for 85 million accrues interest at 638 and series b senior notes due december 2021 for 65 million accrues interest at 653 the amount outstanding under these notes as of january 31 2015  was 150 million we also have unsecured 3375 senior notes due september 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of 250 million interest that is payable on our senior notes is based on fixed interest rates and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates 

interest is receivable on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended january 31 2015  we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible nearterm changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion   stores—ross dress for less ®  “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  

ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1146  locations in 33 states the district of columbia and guam  as of february 1 2014  ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices ross target customers are primarily from middle income households 

we also operate 130  dd’s discounts stores in 10 states  as of february 1 2014  dds discounts features more moderatelypriced firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood and its target customers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than ross customers 

the merchant store and distribution organizations for ross and dd’s discounts are separate and distinct the two chains share certain other corporate and support services 

both our ross and dds discounts brands target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are based on these customer profiles we believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

• maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store 

• meet customer needs on a local basis 

• deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer 

• manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 1 2014  february 2 2013  and january 28 2012  as fiscal 2013  fiscal 2012  and fiscal 2011  respectively fiscal 2012  was a 53week year fiscal 2013  and 2011  were each 52week years 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brand name and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising which emphasizes a strong value message our stores offer a treasurehunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item the mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal 2013  was approximately as follows ladies   29  home accents and bed and bath   24  accessories lingerie fine jewelry and fragrances   13  shoes   13  mens   

13  and childrens   8  our merchandise offerings also include but are not limited to small furniture and furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware watches and sporting goods 

purchasing we have a combined network of approximately 7900  merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe that our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout and packaway purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2013  we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 49  and 47  of total inventories as of february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  respectively and reflects our merchants’ continued ability to take advantage of a large amount of closeout opportunities in the marketplace we believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

our primary buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

over the past year we continued to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization to further enhance our ability to deliver name brand bargains to our customers at the end of fiscal 2013  we had approximately 660  merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct and each includes merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have on average eight  years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdales burlington coat factory foot locker kohl’s loehmann’s lord  taylor macys marshalls nordstrom saks and tj maxx we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in new merchants to further develop our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brand name product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department and 

specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

as of february 1 2014  we operated a total of 1276  stores comprised of 1146  ross stores and 130  dd’s discounts stores our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit we cluster ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management we do the same for dd’s discounts stores 

we believe a key element of our success at both ross and dd’s discounts is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasure hunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers at most stores shopping carts and  or baskets are available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

we use pointofsale “pos” hardware and software systems in all stores which minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing personal checks debit credit and storedvalue cards in a matter of seconds for ross and dd’s discounts combined approximately 62  and 61  of payments in fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  respectively were made with credit cards and debit cards we provide cash credit card and debit card refunds on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to do this are labor costs that are generally lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

information systems 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include enhancements to our merchandise planning core merchandising allocation management and store labor management systems these initiatives support our expansion in both new and existing markets and our assortment execution and plan achievement while also supporting future growth in addition we completed the buildout and relocation of our new data center in fiscal 2013  

distribution 

we have four   distribution processing facilities – two in california one in pennsylvania and one in south carolina we ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model two additional distribution centers in rock hill south carolina and shafter california are currently under construction and expected to open in 2014 and 2015 respectively 

currently we own two  and lease three  other warehouse facilities for packaway storage we are in the process of building two additional warehouses which we plan to open in 2014 we also use other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory 

we also utilize thirdparty cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support our current store growth information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

advertising 

advertising for ross dress for less relies primarily on television to communicate the ross value proposition—everyday savings off the same brands carried at leading department stores this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position we continue to utilize additional channels to build awareness advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local grass roots initiatives 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross dress for less ®  and dd’s discounts ®  have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of february 1 2014  we had approximately 66300  total employees including an estimated 48900  parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customers and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization we also continue to make improvements to our core merchandising system to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources we also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home fashions through catalogs or online the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future

 we are subject to operating risks as we attempt to execute on our merchandising and growth strategies 

the continued success of our business depends in part upon our ability to increase sales at our existing store locations to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis our existing strategies and store and distribution center expansion programs may not result in a continuation of our anticipated revenue or profit growth in executing our offprice retail strategies and working to improve efficiencies expand our store network and reduce our costs we face a number of operational risks including our ability to

our real estate strategy in 2014  is to open stores in states where we currently operate to increase our market penetration and to reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market we also expect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in 2014  important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the local trade area in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

the following table summarizes the locations of our stores by stateterritory as of february 1 2014  and february 2 2013

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

ross stores inc operates two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion stores—ross dress for less ®  “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1146  locations in 33 states the district of columbia and guam  as of february 1 2014  ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices we also operate 130  dd’s discounts stores in 10 states  that feature a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices as of february 1 2014  

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain or improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry and believe our share gains over the past few years were driven mainly by continued focus on value by consumers our sales and earnings gains in 2013  continued to benefit from efficient execution of our offprice model throughout all areas of our business our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday discounts 

looking ahead to 2014  we are planning additional incremental reductions in average store inventory levels while continuing to maintain strict controls on operating expenses as part of our strategy to maximize our profitability 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 1 2014  february 2 2013  and january 28 2012  as fiscal 2013  fiscal 2012  and fiscal 2011  respectively fiscal 2012  was 53 weeks fiscal 2013  and 2011  were 52 weeks 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  



¹ fiscal 2012 was a 53week year all other fiscal years presented were 52 weeks 

stores   total stores open at the end of fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  were 1276  1199  and 1125  respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  increased by 6  7  and 7  from the respective prior years our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2013  increased 05 billion  or 52  compared to the prior year  due to the opening of 77  net new stores during 2013  and a 3  increase in comparable store sales defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2012  increased 11 billion  or 129  compared to the prior year due to the opening of 74  net new stores during 2012  a 6  increase in sales from comparable stores and approximately 149 million in sales from the 53rd week 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  



we intend to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization diversify our merchandise mix and more fully develop our systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2013  increased 3495 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 77  net new stores during the year and a 3  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2013  decreased approximately 15 basis points from the prior year this improvement was due primarily to a 45 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin which was partially offset by increases in occupancy of about 20 basis points and increases in distribution and buying expenses of about 5 basis points each 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2012  increased 7707 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 74  net new stores during the year and a 6  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2012  decreased approximately 40 basis points from the prior year this improvement was due primarily to a 40 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin in addition occupancy leveraged 25 basis points and distribution expenses as a percent of sales also declined approximately 15 

basis points these favorable items were partially offset by increases in buying and freight costs of 25 and 10 basis points respectively and 5 basis points related to the year over year trueup in our shortage reserve 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013  selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 885 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 77  net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2013  increased by approximately 15 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to higher costs related to the relocation of our data center 

for fiscal 2012  sga increased 1338 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 74  net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2012  decreased by approximately 35 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage on store operating expenses 

the largest component of sga is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime as of fiscal year end 2013  2012  and 2011  was approximately 66300  57500  and 53900  respectively 

interest income expense net  in fiscal 2013  interest expense decreased by 72 million  primarily due to higher capitalization of interest related to construction of our new distribution centers interest income decreased by 01 million  primarily due to lower investment yields as compared to the prior year as a percentage of sales net interest expense in fiscal 2013  decreased by approximately five basis points compared to the same period in the prior year the table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  



taxes on earnings our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  was approximately 38  in each year which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is impacted by changes in laws location of new stores level of earnings and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014  will be about 38 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2013  were higher than fiscal 2012  primarily due to lower cost of goods sold partially offset by higher sga net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2012  were higher compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses 

earnings per share  diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013  was 388  compared to 353  in the prior year period the 10  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 6  increase in net earnings and a 4  reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012  was 353  compared to 286  in fiscal 2011  the 23  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to a 20  increase in net earnings and a 3  reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll rent taxes and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores and investments in distribution centers information systems and buying and corporate offices we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 10220 million  9796 million  and 8201 million  in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns 

net cash from operations increased in 2013  compared to 2012  and in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to higher net earnings 

the change in total merchandise inventory net of the change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of approximately 52 million  39 million  and 55 million  for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory was 62  67  and 67  as of february 1 2014  february 2 2013  and january 28 2012  respectively changes in accounts payable leverage are primarily driven by timing of packaway receipts and payments accounts payable leverage at the end of fiscal 2013  was also impacted due to the timing shift of the dividend declaration from january 2014 to february 2014  

as a regular part of our business packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to deliver bargains to our customers 

changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow at the end of fiscal 2013  packaway inventory was 49  of total inventory compared to 47  and 49  at the end of fiscal 2012  and 2011  respectively 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 5638 million  4257 million  and 4718 million  in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  was primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures the decrease in cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  was primarily due to a transfer of funds in fiscal 2011 into restricted accounts to serve as collateral for our insurance obligations 

in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  our capital expenditures were 5505 million  4244 million  and 4163 million  respectively our capital expenditures include costs to build or expand distribution centers develop our new data center open new stores and improve existing stores and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems buying and corporate offices we opened 88  82  and 80  new stores in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively in 2013 we purchased the land and building of our previously leased 13 million square foot perris california distribution center for 70 million we also spent approximately 60 million building out our new corporate headquarters our buying offices our former corporate headquarters two truck and trailer parking facilities three warehouse facilities and all but three of our store locations are leased and except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment do not represent capital investments 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 



in october 2013 we entered into a salepurchase agreement under which we have the right to purchase the office building where our new york buying office is located for 222 million the building is subject to a 99 year ground lease through june 2111 the salepurchase agreement contemplates completion of the sale and purchase of the building on or before september 20 2014 subject to satisfaction of various closing conditions under the salepurchase agreement we provided a deposit of 10 of the purchase price in the event we are unable or choose not to complete the purchase of the building we would forfeit the deposit but have no further liability to the seller or obligation to complete the purchase in september 2013 we deposited 111 million and provided an 111 million standby letter of credit to meet the 10 deposit obligation in january 2014 we deposited an additional 22 million in escrow for the building bringing our total deposit to 133 million we plan to finance the purchase of the building in 2014 

we are forecasting approximately 800 million  in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2014  up from 5505 million  in fiscal 2013  in addition to funding costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open both new ross and dd’s discounts stores the upgrade or relocation of existing stores investments in information technology systems and for various other expenditures related to our stores distribution centers buying and corporate offices this higher capital spending is primarily driven by the expected purchase of our new york buying office and continued construction of our two new distribution centers we expect to primarily fund capital expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations and with proceeds from our planned financing of the purchase of our new york buying office 

we purchased 120 million  and 54 million  of investments in fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  respectively we purchased no investments in fiscal 2011  we had proceeds from investments of 16 million  62 million  and 46 million  in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 6818 million  5570 million  and 5324 million  in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations 

in january 2013 our board of directors approved a twoyear 11 billion stock repurchase program for fiscal 2013 and 2014 we repurchased 82 million  75 million  and 113 million  shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 550 million  450 million  and 450 million  in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively we also acquired 496000  505000  and 442000  shares of treasury stock from our employee stock equity compensation programs for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 299 million  294 million  and 159 million  during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

in february 2014  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 020  per common share payable on march 31 2014  our board of directors declared cash dividends of 017  per common share in january may august and november 2013  cash dividends of 014  per common share in january may august and november 2012  and cash dividends of 011  per common share in january may august and november 2011  

during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  we paid dividends of 1479 million  1257 million  and 1020 million  respectively 

shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade bank and other credit lines to meet our capital and liquidity requirements including lease payment obligations in 2014  

our existing 600 million unsecured revolving credit facility expires in june 2017 and contains a 300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit interest on this facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin currently 

100 basis points and is payable quarterly and upon maturity as of february 1 2014  we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding on this facility and our 600 million credit facility remains in place and available

other 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory   our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weighted average basis or net realizable value we purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to the company’s store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory accounted for 

approximately 49  47  and 49  of total inventories as of february 1 2014  february 2 2013  and january 28 2012  respectively merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets   we record a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2013  2012  or 2011  

depreciation and amortization expense   property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from three to 12 years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term 

lease accounting   when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

insurance obligations   we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation general liability and employeerelated health care benefits our selfinsurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

stockbased compensation   we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards we use historical data to estimate prevesting forfeitures and to recognize stockbased compensation expense all stockbased compensation awards are expensed over the service or performance periods of the awards 

income taxes   we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures our policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 

the critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2013  and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases telephonic reports and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict as a result our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dds discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion   storesross dress for less® “ross” and dd’s discounts® 

ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1091  locations in 33 states the district of columbia and guam  as of february 2 2013  ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices ross target customers are primarily from middle income households 

we also operate 108  dd’s discounts ®  stores in eight states  as of february 2 2013  dds discounts features more moderatelypriced firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood and its target customers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than ross customers 

the merchant store and distribution organizations for ross and dd’s discounts are separate and distinct the two chains share certain other corporate and support services 

both our ross and dds discounts brands target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are based on these customer profiles we believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

• maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store 

• meet customer needs on a local basis 

• deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer 

• manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 2 2013  january 28 2012  and january 29 2011  as fiscal 2012  fiscal 2011  and fiscal 2010  respectively fiscal 2012  was a 53week year fiscal 2011  and 2010  were each 52week years 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brand name and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising which emphasizes a strong value message our stores offer a treasurehunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item the mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal 2012  was approximately as follows ladies   29  

home accents and bed and bath   24  accessories lingerie fine jewelry and fragrances   13  shoes   13  mens   13  and childrens   8  our merchandise offerings also include but are not limited to small furniture and furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware watches and sporting goods 

purchasing we have a combined network of approximately 7900  merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe that our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout and packaway purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2012  we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 47  and 49  of total inventories as of february 2 2013  and january 28 2012  and reflects our merchants’ continued ability to take advantage of a large amount of closeout opportunities in the marketplace we believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

our primary buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships–a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

over the past year we continued to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization to further enhance our ability to deliver name brand bargains to our customers at the end of fiscal 2012  we had approximately 600  merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct and each includes merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have on average 9  years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdales burlington coat factory foot locker kohl’s loehmann’s lord  taylor macys marshalls nordstrom saks and tj maxx we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in new merchants to further develop our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brand name product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department 

and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

as of february 2 2013  we operated a total of 1199  stores comprised of 1091  ross stores and 108  dd’s discounts stores our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit we cluster ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management we do the same for dd’s discounts stores 

we believe a key element of our success is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments at both ross and dd’s discounts which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasure hunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers at most stores shopping carts and  or baskets are available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

we use pointofsale “pos” hardware and software systems in all stores which minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing personal checks debit credit and storedvalue cards in a matter of seconds for ross and dd’s discounts combined approximately 61  and 60  of payments in fiscal 2012  and fiscal 2011  respectively were made with credit cards and debit cards we provide cash credit card and debit card refunds on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to do this are labor costs that are generally lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

information systems 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include enhancements to our merchandise planning core merchandising and allocation management systems these initiatives support our expansion in new markets and our assortment execution and plan achievement while also supporting future growth in addition we made improvements to our networks and our pointofsale systems to increase reliability and speed upgraded our store wireless network and commenced development of our new data center 

distribution 

we have four distribution processing facilities–two in california one in pennsylvania and one in south carolina we ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model over the next two years we plan to invest in two new distribution centers and purchase one of our existing distribution facilities at the expiration of its lease in 2013 

in addition we own two  and lease three  other warehouse facilities for packaway storage we use other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory 

we also utilize thirdparty cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support our current store growth information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

advertising 

advertising for ross dress for less relies primarily on television to communicate the ross value proposition–everyday savings off the same brands carried at leading department stores this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position we continue to utilize additional channels to build awareness advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local grass roots initiatives 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross dress for less ®  and dd’s discounts ®  have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of february 2 2013  we had approximately 57500  total employees including an estimated 41500  parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customers and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our buying organization we also continue to make improvements to our core merchandising system to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources we also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home fashions through catalogs or over the internet the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future

 we are subject to operating risks as we attempt to execute on our merchandising and growth strategies 

the continued success of our business depends in part upon our ability to increase sales at our existing store locations to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis our existing strategies and store and distribution center expansion programs may not result in a continuation of our anticipated revenue or profit growth in executing our offprice retail strategies and working to improve efficiencies expand our store network and reduce our costs we face a number of operational risks including our ability to

our real estate strategy in 2013  is to open stores in states where we currently operate to increase our market penetration and to reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market we also expect to continue our new store expansion in new markets in 2013  important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both new and existing markets are the availability and quality of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the local trade area in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

the following table summarizes the locations of our stores by stateterritory as of february 2 2013  and january 28 2012

ross stores inc operates two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion stores–ross dress for less® “ross” and dd’s discounts® ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1091  locations in 33 states the district of columbia and guam  as of february 2 2013  ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices as of february 2 2013  we also operate 108  dd’s discounts stores in eight states  that feature a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain or improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry total aggregate sales for the five largest offprice retailers in the united states increased 11  during 2012  on top of a 6  increase in 2011  this compares to total national apparel sales which increased 4  during 2012  compared to a 3  increase in 2011  according to data published by the npd group inc a leading provider of global information and advisory services company 

we believe that the stronger relative sales gains of the offprice retailers during 2012  and 2011  were driven mainly by continued focus on value by consumers over the past few years our sales and earnings gains in 2012  continued to benefit from efficient execution of our offprice model throughout all areas of our business our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday discounts 

looking ahead to 2013  we are planning further reductions in average store inventory levels while continuing to maintain strict controls on operating expenses as part of our strategy to maximize our profitability 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 2 2013  january 28 2012  and january 29 2011  as fiscal 2012  fiscal 2011  and fiscal 2010  respectively fiscal 2012  was a 53week year fiscal 2011  and 2010  were each 52 weeks 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  



stores   total stores open at the end of fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  were 1199  1125  and 1055  respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  increased by 7  7  and 5  from the respective prior years our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2012  increased 11 billion  or 129  compared to the prior year  due to the opening of 74  net new stores during 2012  and a 6  increase in comparable store sales defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2011  increased 7422 million  or 94  compared to the prior year due to the opening of 70  net new stores during 2011  and a 5  increase in sales from comparable stores 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  



we intend to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization diversify our merchandise mix and more fully develop our organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2012  increased 7707 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 74  net new stores during the year and a 6  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2012  decreased approximately 40 basis points from the prior year this improvement was due primarily to a 40 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin in addition occupancy leveraged 25 basis points and distribution expenses as a percent of sales also declined approximately 15 basis points these favorable items were partially offset by increases in buying and freight costs of 25 and 10 basis points respectively and 5 basis points related to the year over year trueup in our shortage reserve 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2011  increased 5110 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 70  net new stores during the year and a 5  increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2011  decreased approximately 35 basis points from the prior year this improvement was mainly the result of a 50 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower shortage in addition occupancy leveraged 20 basis points these improvements 

were partially offset by increases in freight costs of about 20 basis points distribution expenses of about 10 basis points and buying costs of about five basis points 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses    for fiscal 2012  selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 1338 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 74  net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2012  decreased by approximately 35 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage on store operating expenses 

for fiscal 2011  sga increased 743 million  compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 70  net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2011  decreased by approximately 50 basis points compared to the prior year due equally to a combination of leverage on both general and administrative and store operating expenses 

the largest component of sga is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime as of fiscal year end 2012  2011  and 2010  was approximately 57500  53900  and 49500  respectively 

interest expense income net  in fiscal 2012  interest expense decreased by 35 million  primarily due to higher capitalization of construction interest interest income decreased by 01 million  primarily due to lower investment yields as compared to the prior year as a percentage of sales net interest expense in fiscal 2012  decreased by approximately five basis points compared to the same period in the prior year the table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  



taxes on earnings our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  was approximately 38  in each year which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is impacted by changes in laws location of new stores level of earnings and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  will be about 38 

net earnings   net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2012  were higher compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2011  were higher compared to fiscal 2010  primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales 

earnings per share  diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012  was 353  compared to 286  in the prior year period the 23  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 20  increase in net earnings and a 3  reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011  was 286  compared to 231  in fiscal 2010  the 24  increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an 18  increase in net earnings and a 4  reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the stock repurchase program 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll rent taxes and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores and investments in distribution centers information systems and buying and corporate offices we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 9796 million  8201 million  and 6730 million  in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  was primarily driven by net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns 

net cash from operations increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to higher net earnings net cash from operations increased in 2011  compared to 2010  primarily due to higher net earnings and lower working capital used to purchase additional packaway inventory 

the change in total merchandise inventory net of the change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of approximately 39 million  55 million  and 112 million  for fiscal 2012   2011  and 2010  respectively accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory was 67  67  and 71  as of february 2 2013  january 28 2012  and january 29 2011  respectively changes in accounts payable leverage are primarily driven by timing of packaway receipts 

as a regular part of our business packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to deliver bargains to our customers 

changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow at the end of fiscal 2012  packaway inventory was 47  of total inventory compared to 49  and 47  at the end of fiscal 2011  and 2010  respectively 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 4257 million  4718 million  and 1968 million  in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  was primarily due to a transfer of funds in fiscal 2011 into restricted accounts to serve as collateral for our insurance obligations the increase in cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures and a transfer of funds into restricted accounts to serve as collateral for our insurance obligations in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  our capital expenditures were 4244 million  4163 million  and 1987 million  respectively our capital expenditures include costs to build or expand distribution centers and our new data center open new stores and improve existing stores and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems buying and corporate offices we opened 82  80  and 56  new stores in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively our buying offices our corporate headquarters one distribution center one trailer parking lot three warehouse facilities and all but three of our store locations are leased and except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment do not represent capital investments 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 



we are forecasting approximately 670 million  in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2013  in addition to funding costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open both new ross and dd’s discounts stores the upgrade or relocation of existing stores investments in information technology systems and for various other expenditures related to our stores distribution centers buying and corporate offices the expected growth in capital expenditures in 2013  is mainly due to our investment over the next two years in two new distribution centers the purchase of one of our existing leased distribution centers the relocation of our corporate headquarters and the development of our new data center we expect to fund these expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations 

we purchased 54 million  of investments in fiscal 2012  no investments in fiscal 2011  and 68 million  in fiscal 2010  we had proceeds from investments of 62 million  46 million  and 86 million  in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 5570 million  5324 million  and 4106 million  in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively during fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations 

we repurchased 75 million  113 million  and 135 million  shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 450 million  450 million  and 375 million  in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively in january 2013 our board of directors approved a twoyear 11 billion stock repurchase program for fiscal 2013 and 2014 

in january 2013  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 017  per common share payable on march 29 2013  our board of directors declared cash dividends of 014  per common share in january may august and november 2012  cash dividends of 011  per common share in january may august and november 2011  and cash dividends of 008  per common share in january may august and november 2010  

during fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  we paid dividends of 1257 million  1020 million  and 773 million  respectively 

shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade bank and other credit lines to meet our capital and liquidity requirements including lease payment obligations in 2013  

in june 2012 we amended our existing 600 million unsecured revolving credit facility the amended credit facility expires in june 2017 and contains a 300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit interest on this facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin currently 1125 basis points and is payable upon maturity but not less than quarterly as of february 2 2013  we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding on this facility and our 600 million credit facility remains in place and available 

we estimate that existing cash balances cash flows from operations bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital investments common stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months

other 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory   our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weighted average basis or net realizable value we purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to the company’s store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory accounted for approximately 47  49  and 47  of total inventories as of february 2 2013  january 28 2012  and january 29 2011  merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets   we record a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2012  2011  or 2010  

depreciation and amortization expense   property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from three to 12 years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term 

lease accounting   when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

insurance obligations   we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation general liability and employeerelated health care benefits our selfinsurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

stockbased compensation   we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards we use historical data to estimate prevesting forfeitures and to recognize stockbased compensation expense all stockbased compensation awards are expensed over the service or performance periods of the awards 

income taxes   we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures our policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 

the critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

effects of inflation or deflation  we do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2012  and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases telephonic reports and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict as a result our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dds discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of february 2 2013  

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of february 2 2013  we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility in addition lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 

in addition we have two outstanding series of unsecured notes held by institutional investors series a for 85 million accrues interest at 638 and series b for 65 million accrues interest at 653 the amount outstanding under these notes as of february 2 2013  was 150 million 

interest is receivable on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended february 2 2013  we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible nearterm changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two brands of offprice retail apparel and home fashion stores at january 28 2012 we operated a total of 1125 stores of which 1037 were ross dress for less ® “ross” locations in 29 states the district of columbia and guam and 88 were dd’s discounts ® stores in seven states both brands target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 ross target customers are primarily from middle income households while dd’s discounts target customers are typically from more moderate income households the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are based on these customer profiles 

ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices dd’s discounts features a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices we believe that both ross and dd’s discounts derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store   meet customer needs on a local basis   deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer   manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets we refer to our fiscal years ended january 28 2012 january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 as fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brand name and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising which emphasizes a strong value message our stores offer a treasurehunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection of brand names within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item the mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal 2011 was approximately as follows ladies 29 home accents and bed and bath 25 mens 13 accessories lingerie fine jewelry and fragrances 13 shoes 12 and children’s 8 our merchandise offerings also include small furniture and furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware watches and sporting goods 

purchasing we have a combined network of approximately 7800 merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe that our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout and packaway purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2011 we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 49 and 47 of total inventories as of january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 and reflects our merchants’ continued ability to take advantage of a large amount of closeout opportunities in the marketplace we believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

our buying offices are primarily located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships–a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

over the past year we continued to make strategic investments in our merchandise organization to further enhance our ability to deliver name brand bargains to our customers at the end of fiscal 2011 we had a total of approximately 510 merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined up from 450 in the prior year the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct these buying resources include merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have on average 10 years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdales burlington coat factory foot locker homegoods kohl’s loehmann’s lord  taylor macys marshalls nordstrom saks and tj maxx we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in new merchants to further develop our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brand name product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

at january 28 2012 we operated a total of 1125 stores comprised of 1037 ross stores and 88 dd’s discounts stores our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit we cluster ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management we do the same for dd’s discounts stores 

we believe a key element of our success is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments at both ross and dd’s discounts which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasure hunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to promote customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers at most stores shopping carts are available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

we use pointofsale “pos” hardware and software systems in all stores which minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing personal checks debit credit and electronic gift cards in a matter of seconds for ross and dd’s discounts combined approximately 60 and 58 of payments in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively were made with credit cards and debit cards we provide cash credit card and debit card refunds on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to do this are labor costs that are generally lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

information systems 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years 

recent initiatives include enhancements to our merchandise planning core merchandising and allocation systems these initiatives support our entry into new markets and our assortment execution and plan achievement while also supporting future growth in addition we made improvements to our networks and our pointofsale systems to increase reliability and speed and are also upgrading our store wireless network 

distribution 

we have four distribution processing facilities–two in california one in pennsylvania and one in south carolina we ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model 

in addition we own two and lease three other warehouse facilities for packaway storage we use other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory 

we also utilize thirdparty cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support store growth in 2012 information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

advertising 

we rely primarily on television advertising to communicate the ross value proposition–brand name merchandise at everyday low prices this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and costeffective medium for communicating everyday savings on a wide selection of brand name bargains for both the family and home advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local grass roots initiatives 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross dress for less ® and dd’s discounts ® have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of january 28 2012 we had approximately 53900 total employees including an estimated 39000 parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees–especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customers and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our buying organization we also continue to make improvements to our core merchandising system to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources we also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home fashions through catalogs or over the internet the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future 

dd’s discounts 

at january 28 2012 we operated 88 dd’s discounts in seven states 48 in california 19 in texas 12 in florida four in arizona two in georgia two in nevada and one in maryland at january 29 2011 we had 40 dd’s discounts stores in california 14 in texas seven in florida and two each in arizona georgia and nevada for a total of 67 stores dd’s discounts targets the needs of households with more moderate incomes than ross customers  we believe this is one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country dd’s discounts features a moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices 

the dd’s discounts business generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of ross but features a different mix of brands at lower average price points the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood the merchant store and distribution organizations for dd’s discounts and ross are separate and distinct however dd’s discounts shares certain other corporate and support services with ross

the continued success of our business depends in part upon our ability to increase sales at our existing store locations to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis our existing strategies and store expansion programs may not result in a continuation of our anticipated revenue or profit growth in executing our offprice retail strategies and working to improve efficiencies expand our store network and reduce our costs we face a number of operational risks including

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

ross stores inc operates two offprice retail chains – ross dress for less ® “ross” and dd’s discounts ®  ross is the largest offprice apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1037 locations in 29 states the district of columbia and guam ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices we also operate 88 dd’s discounts locations in seven states that feature a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain or improve profitability and improve financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry total aggregate sales for the five largest offprice retailers in the united states increased 6 during 2011 on top of an 8 increase in 2010 the 6 offprice growth in 2011 compares favorably to total national apparel sales which increased 4 according to data published by the npd group inc a leading provider of comprehensive consumer and retail information worldwide 

we believe that the stronger relative sales gains of the offprice retailers during 2011 and 2010 were driven mainly by an increased focus on value by consumers over the past few years our sales and earnings gains in 2011 continued to benefit from efficient execution of our offprice model throughout all areas of our business our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday discounts 

looking ahead to 2012 we are planning further reductions in average store inventory levels while continuing to maintain strict controls on operating expenses as part of our strategy to help maximize our profitability 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 28 2012 january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 as fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 each had 52 weeks

 sales sales for fiscal 2011 increased 7422 million or 94 compared to the prior year due to the opening of 70 net new stores during 2011 and a 5 increase in sales from “comparable” stores defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2010 increased 6819 million or 95 compared to the prior year due to the opening of 50 net new stores during 2010 and a 5 increase in sales from comparable stores 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 



we intend to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization to diversify our merchandise mix and to more fully develop our organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2011 increased 5110 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 70 net new stores during the year and a 5 increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2011 decreased approximately 35 basis points from the prior year this improvement was mainly the result of a 50 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower shortage in addition occupancy leveraged 20 basis points these improvements were partially offset by increases in freight costs of about 20 basis points distribution expenses of about 10 basis points and buying costs of about five basis points 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2010 increased 4025 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 50 net new stores during the year and a 5 increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 decreased approximately 130 basis points from the prior year this improvement was mainly the result of an 80 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower shortage in addition occupancy leveraged 30 basis points and distribution costs declined by about 30 basis points these improvements were partially offset by an increase in freight costs of about 10 basis points 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 743 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 70 net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2011 decreased by approximately 50 basis points compared to the prior year due equally to a combination of leverage on both general and administrative and store operating expenses 

for fiscal 2010 sga increased 990 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 50 net new stores during the year sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year mainly driven by leverage on store operating expenses 

the largest component of sga is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime as of fiscal year end 2011 2010 and 2009 was approximately 53900 49500 and 45600 respectively 

interest expense income net in fiscal 2011 interest expense increased by 03 million primarily due to issuance costs for our revolving credit facility while interest income decreased by 04 million primarily due to lower investment yields as compared to the prior year as a percentage of sales net interest expense in fiscal 2011 remained flat compared to the prior year the table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 



taxes on earnings our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 was approximately 38 in each year which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is impacted by changes in laws location of new stores level of earnings and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 will be about 38 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2011 were higher compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 were higher compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales 

earnings per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 was 286 compared to 231 in fiscal 2010 this 24 increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 18 increase in net earnings and a 4 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 was 231 compared to 177 in fiscal 2009 this 31 increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 25 increase in net earnings and a 4 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll rent taxes capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores and investments in distribution centers and information systems we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 8201 million 6730 million and 8884 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the primary sources of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 were net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns 

net cash from operations increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher net earnings and lower working capital used to purchase additional packaway inventory we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to deliver bargains to our customers as a regular part of our business packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace 

packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to the company’s store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months 

changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow at the end of fiscal 2011 packaway inventory was 49 of total inventory compared to 47 and 38 at the end of fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively packaway inventory as a percentage of our total inventory has increased since 2010 as we took advantage of the increased availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace 

the change in total merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of approximately 55 million and 112 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively 

accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory decreased to 67 as of january 28 2012 from 71 as of january 29 2011 as a result of higher packaway inventory 

we believe that our existing cash balances cash flows from operations available bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 4718 million 1968 million and 1368 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and a transfer of funds into restricted accounts to serve as collateral for our insurance obligations 

in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 our capital expenditures were 4163 million 1987 million and 1585 million respectively our capital expenditures include costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores and costs to implement information technology systems build or expand distribution centers and various other expenditures related to our stores buying and corporate offices we opened 80 56 and 56 new stores in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

in april 2011 we purchased a 449000 square foot warehouse for packaway storage in riverside california for 205 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 we purchased the land and building of an existing store location in southern california which was previously leased and we acquired land and buildings for our future corporate headquarters in dublin california for a combined total of approximately 100 million 

we are forecasting approximately 450 million in capital expenditures in 2012 to fund expenditures for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open both new ross and dd’s discounts stores for the relocation or upgrade of existing stores for investments in store and merchandising systems buildings and equipment for building distribution centers and implementing material handling equipment and related systems and for various buying and corporate office expenditures we expect to fund these expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 



we had no purchases of investments in fiscal 2011 and purchased investments of 68 million and 29 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively we had sales of investments of 46 million 86 million and 245 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 5324 million 4106 million and 3046 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations our buying offices our corporate headquarters one distribution center one trailer parking lot three warehouse facilities and all but three of our store locations are leased and except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment do not represent capital investments we own distribution centers in each of the following cities carlisle pennsylvania moreno valley california and fort mill south carolina we own two warehouse facilities one in fort mill south carolina and the other in riverside california 

we repurchased 113 million 135 million and 148 million shares of our common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 450 million 375 million and 300 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in january 2011 our board of directors approved a twoyear 900 million stock repurchase program for fiscal 2011 and 2012 

in january 2012 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 14 per common share payable on march 30 2012 our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of 11 per common share in january may august and november 2011 cash dividends of 08 per common share in january may august and november 2010 and cash dividends of 055 per common share in january may august and november 2009 

shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade bank and other credit lines to meet our capital and liquidity requirements including lease payment obligations in 2012 

in march 2011 we entered into a new 600 million unsecured revolving credit facility this credit facility which replaced our previous 600 million revolving credit facility expires in march 2016 interest on this facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin currently 150 basis points and is payable upon maturity but not less than quarterly as of january 28 2012 our 600 million credit facility remains in place and available 

we estimate that existing cash balances cash flows from operations bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital investments common stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months

other 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weighted average basis or net realizable value we purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise and its relation to the company’s store merchandise assortment plans as such the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months packaway inventory accounted for approximately 49 and 47 of total inventories as of january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets we record a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2011 2010 or 2009 

depreciation and amortization expense property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from five to 12 years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term 

lease accounting when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

insurance obligations we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation general liability and employeerelated health care benefits our selfinsurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

stockbased compensation we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards we use historical data to estimate prevesting forfeitures and to recognize stockbased compensation expense all stockbased compensation awards are expensed over the service or performance periods of the awards 

income taxes we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures our policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 

the critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

effects of inflation or deflation we do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations 

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201104 “fair value measurements topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss” “asu 201104” asu 201104 changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between us gaap and ifrs asu 201104 also expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements asu 201104 is to be applied prospectively and is effective for the company in fiscal 2012 we believe adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201105 “comprehensive income topic 220 presentation of comprehensive income” “asu 201105” asu 201105 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity asu 201105 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements this new guidance is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for the company in fiscal 2012 we believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2011 and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases telephonic reports and other investor communications including those on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict as a result our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd’s discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of january 28 2012 

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 28 2012 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility in addition lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 

in addition we have two outstanding series of unsecured notes held by institutional investors series a for 85 million accrues interest at 638 and series b for 65 million accrues interest at 653 the amount outstanding under these notes as of january 28 2012 was 150 million 

interest is receivable on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended january 28 2012 we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible nearterm changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 business 

 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two brands of offprice retail apparel and home accessories stores at january 29 2011 we operated a total of 1055 stores of which 988 were ross dress for less ® “ross” locations in 27 states and guam and 67 were dd’s discounts ® stores in six states both brands target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 ross target customers are primarily from middle income households while the dd’s discounts target customer is typically from more moderate income households the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are based on these customer profiles 

 

ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 percent off department and specialty store regular prices dd’s discounts features a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 70 percent off moderate department and discount store regular prices we believe that both ross and dd’s discounts derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store meet customer needs on a local basis deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets we refer to our fiscal years ended january 29 2011 january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 as fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively 

 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brandname and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 percent below department and specialty store regular prices at ross and 20 to 70 percent below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brandname merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising which emphasizes a strong value message our stores offer a treasurehunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brandname bargains for the family and the home 

 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brandname label on the merchandise we sell 

 

 

 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection of brand names within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item the mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal 2010 was approximately as follows ladies 29 home accents and bed and bath 25 mens 13 accessories lingerie fine jewelry and fragrances 12 shoes 12 and children’s 9 our merchandise offerings also include product categories such as small furniture and furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware watches sporting goods and in select ross stores fine jewelry 

 

purchasing we have a combined network of approximately 7800 merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

 

we believe that our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brandname and designer merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout and packaway purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

 

in fiscal 2010 we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 47 and 38 of total inventories as of january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 this growth reflects our merchants’ continued ability to take advantage of a large amount of closeout opportunities in the marketplace we believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

 

in 2009 we completed a chainwide rollout of information system enhancements and process changes to improve our merchandising capabilities we continue to utilize these tools which are designed to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate at a more local versus regional level the longterm objective of these investments is to fine tune our merchandise offerings to address more localized customer preferences and thereby gradually increase sales productivity and gross profit margins in both newer and existing regions and markets 

 

 

 

our buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships  a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

 

over the past year we continued to make strategic investments in our merchandise organization to further enhance our ability to deliver name brand bargains to our customers at the end of fiscal 2010 we had a total of approximately 450 merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined up from 410 in the prior year the ross and dd’s discounts buying organizations are separate and distinct these buying resources include merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have an average of about 12 years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as ann taylor bloomingdales burlington coat factory foot locker homegoods kohl’s loehmann’s lord  taylor macys marshalls nordstrom saks and tj maxx we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in new merchants to further develop our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

 

pricing our policy is to sell brandname merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 percent below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brandname product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 percent below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

 

stores 

 

at january 29 2011 we operated a total of 1055 stores comprised of 988 ross stores and 67 dd’s discounts stores our stores are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market permits we cluster stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management 

 

we believe a key element of our success is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments at both ross and dd’s discounts which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasure hunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to promote customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas our stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers promoting a selfservice atmosphere at most stores shopping carts are available at the entrance for customer convenience cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

 

 

 

we use pointofsale “pos” hardware and software systems in all stores which minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing personal checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds in addition the pos systems allow us to accept debit cards and electronic gift cards from customers for ross and dd’s discounts combined approximately 58 of payments in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were made with credit cards and debit cards we provide cash credit card and debit card refunds on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or credited with store credit 

 

operating costs 

 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to keep operating costs low are 

labor costs that generally are lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs as a result of centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions flexible store layout criteria which facilitates conversion of existing buildings to our formats information systems 

 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include the following 

we made enhancements to our merchandise planning systems and began a multiyear program to upgrade our inventory allocation system we made improvements to our core merchandising system to provide our merchants with new tools to increase their effectiveness we implemented enhancements to our it systems to support expansion into new markets and new regions we made improvements to our warehouse management and control systems to drive process efficiencies in our distribution centers and to provide the ability to support future volume requirements we upgraded our sales audit system to reduce system processing times we automated our customer check deposit process to reduce overall bank fees and accelerate check funding we implemented a new credit card tokenization system for added security 6 

 

 

distribution 

 

we have four distribution processing facilities–two in california and one each in pennsylvania and south carolina we ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model 

 

in addition we own one and lease three other warehouse facilities for packaway storage we use other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory 

 

we also utilize thirdparty cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to six times per week depending on location 

 

we believe that our distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support store growth in 2011 information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

 

advertising 

 

we rely primarily on television advertising to communicate the ross value propositionbrandname merchandise at low everyday prices this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and costeffective medium for communicating everyday savings on a wide selection of brandname bargains for both the family and home advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local grass roots initiatives 

 

trademarks 

 

the trademarks for ross dress for less ® and dd’s discounts ® have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

 

employees 

 

as of january 29 2011 we had approximately 49500 total employees including an estimated 35500 parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employeesespecially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

 

competition 

 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home accessories industry are offering significant discounts on brandname merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customer and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our buying organization we also continue to make improvements to our core merchandising system to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources we also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home accessories through catalogs or over the internet the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future 

  

 

 

dd’s discounts 

 

at january 29 2011 we operated 67 dd’s discounts in six states 40 in california 14 in texas 7 in florida 2 in arizona 2 in georgia and 2 in nevada at january 30 2010 we had 39 dd’s discounts stores in california 7 in texas 5 in florida and 1 in arizona for a total of 52 stores this younger offprice concept targets the needs of households with more moderate incomes than ross customers  we believe this is one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country dd’s discounts features a moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 70 percent off moderate department and discount store regular prices 

 

the dd’s discounts business generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of ross but features a different mix of brands at lower average price points the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood the merchant store and distribution organizations for dd’s discounts and ross are separate and distinct however dd’s discounts shares certain other corporate and support services with ross

the continued success of our business depends in part upon our ability to increase sales at our existing store locations to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis our existing strategies and store expansion programs may not result in a continuation of our anticipated revenue or profit growth in executing our offprice retail strategies and working to improve efficiencies expand our store network and reduce our costs we face a number of operational risks including

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

  

overview 

 

we are the second largest offprice apparel and home goods retailer in the united states at the end of fiscal 2010 we operated 988 ross dress for less ® “ross” locations in 27 states and guam and 67 dd’s discounts ® stores in six states ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 60 percent off department and specialty store regular prices dd’s discounts features a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 70 percent off moderate department and discount store regular prices 

 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain or improve profitability and improve financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry total aggregate sales for five of the largest offprice retailers in the united states increased 8 during 2010 on top of a 7 increase in 2009 this compares to total national apparel sales which increased 2 during 2010 compared to a 5 decrease in 2009 according to data published by the npd group inc a leading provider of comprehensive consumer and retail information worldwide 

 

we believe that the stronger relative sales gains of the offprice retailers during 2009 and 2010 were driven mainly by an increased focus on value by consumers over the past two years our sales and earnings gains in 2010 continued to benefit from efficient execution of our offprice model throughout all areas of our business our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of our offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday discounts 

 

looking ahead to 2011 we are planning further reductions in average store inventory levels while continuing to maintain strict controls on operating expenses as part of our strategy to help us maximize our profitability 

 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 29 2011 january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 as fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 each had 52 weeks

sales sales for fiscal 2010 increased 6819 million or 95 compared to the prior year due to the opening of 50 net new stores during 2010 and a 5 increase in sales from “comparable” stores defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2009 increased 6981 million or 108 compared to the prior year due to the opening of 49 net new stores during 2009 and a 6 increase in sales from comparable stores

we intend to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization to diversify our merchandise mix and to more fully develop our organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings 

 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2010 increased 4025 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 50 net new stores during the year and a 5 increase in sales from comparable stores 

 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 decreased approximately 130 basis points from the prior year this improvement was mainly the result of an 80 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower shortage in addition occupancy leveraged 30 basis points and distribution costs declined by about 30 basis points these improvements were partially offset by an increase in freight costs of about 10 basis points 

 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2009 increased 3707 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 49 net new stores during the year and a 6 increase in sales from comparable stores 

 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2009 decreased approximately 230 basis points from the prior year this improvement was mainly the result of a 170 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin which included a 40 basis point benefit from lower shortage in addition freight costs declined by about 50 basis points occupancy leveraged 35 basis points and distribution costs declined by about 10 basis points these improvements were partially offset by a 35 basis point increase in buying expenses due in part to higher incentive costs versus the prior year 

 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 will continue in future years 

 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 990 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 50 net new stores during the year 

 

sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year mainly driven by leverage on store operating expenses 

 

for fiscal 2009 sga increased 965 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 49 net new stores during the year 

 

 

 

sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2009 decreased by approximately 20 basis points compared to the prior year this decrease was mainly driven by 40 basis points of leverage on store operating expenses that was partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in general and administrative expenses due in part to higher incentive costs versus the prior year 

 

the largest component of sga is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime as of fiscal year end 2010 2009 and 2008 was approximately 49500 45600 and 40000 respectively 

 

interest expense income net in fiscal 2010 interest expense increased by 13 million primarily due to lower capitalization of construction interest in fiscal 2010 interest income decreased by 07 million primarily due to lower investment yields as compared to the prior year as a percentage of sales net interest expense in fiscal 2010 remained flat compared to the prior year the table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

taxes on earnings our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 was approximately 38 in each year which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is impacted by changes in law location of new stores level of earnings and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 will be about 38 

 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 were higher compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2009 were higher compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales 

 

earnings per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 was 463 compared to 354 in fiscal 2009 this 31 increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 25 increase in net earnings and a 4 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 was 354 compared to 233 in fiscal 2008 this 52 increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 45 increase in net earnings and a 5 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

 

financial condition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases payroll rent taxes capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores and investments in distribution centers and information systems we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends 

 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6730 million 8884 million and 5834 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the primary sources of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 were net earnings plus noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization net cash from operations decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to cash used to purchase additional packaway inventory at the end of 2010 accounts payable leverage defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory was 71 as of january 29 2011 and 75 as of january 30 2010 the decrease in leverage was due to higher packaway inventory 

 

our primary source of liquidity is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns 

 

investing activities 

 

in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 our capital expenditures were 1987 million 1585 million and 2244 million respectively our capital expenditures included costs of fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores and costs to implement information technology systems build or expand distribution centers and various other expenditures related to our stores buying and corporate offices in fiscal 2008 we also purchased land in south carolina with the intention of building a new distribution center in the future we opened 56 56 and 77 new stores in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

we had purchases of investments of 68 million 29 million and 370 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we had sales of investments of 86 million 245 million and 425 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

we are forecasting approximately 380 million to 390 million in capital expenditures in 2011 to fund expenditures for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open both new ross and dd’s discounts stores for the relocation or upgrade of existing stores for investments in store and merchandising systems buildings equipment and systems and for various buying and corporate office expenditures we expect to fund these expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations 

 

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 

 

 

 

 

financing activities 

 

during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations our buying offices our corporate headquarters one distribution center one trailer parking lot three warehouse facilities and all but two of our store locations are leased and except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment do not represent capital investments we own one distribution center in each of the following cities carlisle pennsylvania moreno valley california and fort mill south carolina and one warehouse facility in fort mill south carolina 

 

we repurchased 67 million 74 million and 93 million shares of our common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 375 million 300 million and 300 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in january 2011 our board of directors approved a new twoyear 900 million stock repurchase program for fiscal 2011 and 2012 replacing the 375 million remaining under the prior twoyear 750 million stock repurchase program approved in january 2010

shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade bank and other credit lines to meet our capital and liquidity requirements including lease payment obligations in 2011 

 

in march 2011 we entered into a new 600 million unsecured revolving credit facility this credit facility which replaced our previous 600 million revolving credit facility expires in march 2016 interest on this facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin currently 150 basis points and is payable upon maturity but not less than quarterly

other 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

merchandise inventory our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using a weighted average basis or net realizable value we purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway inventory accounted for approximately 47 and 38 of total inventories as of january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

  

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

  

longlived assets we record a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2010 2009 or 2008 

  

depreciation and amortization expense property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from five to 12 years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real property the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term 

  

  

  

lease accounting when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

selfinsurance we selfinsure certain of our workers’ compensation and general liability risks as well as certain coverages under our health plans our selfinsurance liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

  

stockbased compensation we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards we use historical data to estimate prevesting forfeitures and to recognize stockbased compensation expense all stockbased compensation awards are expensed over the service or performance periods of the awards 

  

income taxes we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures our policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 

  

the critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

  

effects of inflation or deflation we do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2010 and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases telephonic reports and other investor communications including on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

  

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict as a result our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd’s discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 

  

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

  

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of january 29 2011 

  

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 29 2011 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility in addition lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 

  

in addition we issued unsecured notes to institutional investors in two series series a for 85 million accrues interest at 638 and series b for 65 million accrues interest at 653 the amount outstanding under these notes as of january 29 2011 was 150 million 

  

interest is receivable on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

  

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended january 29 2011 we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material 

  

  

  







 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report 

  

it should be noted that any system of controls however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met in addition the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

our internal control over financial reporting as of january 29 2011 has also been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm and their opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is stated in their report dated march 29 2011 which is included in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements it should be noted that any system of controls however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met in addition the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

quarterly evaluation of changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any change occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation our management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth fiscal quarter

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brandname label on the merchandise we sell 

 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection of brand names within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item the mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal 2009 was approximately as follows ladies 30 home accents and bed and bath 24 mens 13 accessories lingerie fine jewelry and fragrances 13 shoes 11 and children’s 9 our merchandise offerings also include product categories such as small furniture and furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware watches sporting goods and in select ross stores fine jewelry 

 

purchasing we have a combined network of approximately 7700 merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

 

we believe that our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brandname and designer merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department specialty and discount stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

 

the majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout and packaway purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

 

in fiscal 2009 we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 38 of total inventories as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 we believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

 

 

we continued to roll out additional information system enhancements and process changes to improve our merchandising capabilities these new tools are designed to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate at a more local versus regional level we completed the chainwide rollout to all merchandise categories for ross in fiscal 2009 which was earlier than planned the longterm objective of these investments is to fine tune our merchandise offerings to address more localized customer preferences and thereby gradually increase sales productivity and gross profit margins in both newer and existing regions and markets   

  

our buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships  a key element to the success of our offprice buying strategies 

 

over the past year we continued to make strategic investments in our merchandise organization to further enhance our ability to deliver name brand bargains to our customers at the end of fiscal 2009 we had a total of approximately 410 merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined up from 360 in the prior year the ross and dd’s buying organizations are separate and distinct these buying resources include merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have an average of about 12 years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as ann taylor bloomingdales burlington coat factory foot locker homegoods kohl’s loehmann’s lord  taylor macys marshalls nordstrom saks and tj maxx we expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in new merchants to further develop our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and to purchase dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

 

pricing our policy is to sell brandname merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 percent below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brandname product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 percent below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

 

stores 

 

at january 30 2010 we operated a total of 1005 stores comprised of 953 ross stores and 52 dd’s discounts stores our stores are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market permits we cluster stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management 

 

 

we believe a key element of our success is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments at both ross and dd’s discounts which allow customers to shop at their own pace while our stores promote a selfservice treasure hunt shopping experience the layouts are designed to promote customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas each stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers promoting a selfservice atmosphere at most stores shopping carts are available at the entrance for customer convenience all cash registers are centrally located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

  

we use pointofsale “pos” hardware and software systems in all stores which minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing personal checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds in addition the pos systems allow us to accept debit cards and electronic gift cards from customers for ross and dd’s discounts combined approximately 58 of payments in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were made with credit cards and debit cards we provide cash credit card and debit card refunds on all merchandise not used worn or altered returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or credited with store credit 

 

operating costs 

 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to keep operating costs low are 

labor costs that generally are lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies   economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs as a result of centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions   

flexible store layout criteria which facilitates conversion of existing buildings to our formats 

information systems 

 

we continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include the following 

we completed the rollout of demand forecasting software and related process changes designed to strengthen our merchandise planning effectiveness for ross we expect this initiative to drive gradual increases over time in store sales productivity and profitability by improving our ability to plan buy and allocate product at a more local level   

we implemented additional supply chain enhancements to support expansion and improvement of our supply chain network we also implemented a new labor time and attendance system at all of our distribution centers   

we completed the rollout of new tools to better support the continued growth of our import business these new tools provide our merchants with greater visibility into item cost components and inbound movement of import products 

 

we made enhancements to our pos systems to reduce customer transaction and wait times   we implemented enhanced labor scheduling capabilities to give our stores the ability to better align the workforce with instore activities   we upgraded our loss prevention software to allow for greater indepth analysis and reporting we also invested in additional store video surveillance systems to provide centralized remote monitoring   we implemented new online tools to assist our stores in their recruiting and hiring efforts these new tools are designed to help our store managers expedite the hiring process and increase the quality of hiring decisions distribution 

 

we have four distribution processing facilities–two in california and one each in pennsylvania and south carolina we ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model 

 

in addition we own one and lease three other warehouse facilities for packaway storage we use other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory 

 

we also utilize thirdparty cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to six times per week depending on location 

 

we believe that our existing distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support store growth over the next few years additional information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “properties” in item 2 

 

advertising 

 

we rely primarily on television advertising to communicate the ross value propositionbrandname merchandise at low everyday prices this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and costeffective medium for communicating everyday savings on a wide selection of brandname bargains for both the family and home advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local grass roots initiatives 

 

trademarks 

 

the trademarks for ross dress for less ® and dd’s discounts ® have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

 

employees 

 

as of january 30 2010 we had approximately 45600 total employees including an estimated 32300 parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employeesespecially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

  

 

competition 

 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home accessories industry are offering significant discounts on brandname merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment that appeals to our target customer and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our buying organization as discussed under information systems we also recently completed the rollout in fiscal 2009 of additional enhancements to our merchandise planning system to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macro economic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources we also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home accessories through catalogs or over the internet the retail apparel and homerelated businesses may become even more competitive in the future 

  

dd’s discounts 

 

at january 30 2010 we operated 52 dd’s discounts in four states 39 in california 7 in texas 5 in florida and 1 in arizona at january 31 2009 we had 39 dd’s discounts stores in california 6 in florida 5 in texas and 2 in arizona for a total of 52 stores this smaller offprice concept targets the needs of households with more moderate incomes than ross customers  we believe this is one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country dd’s discounts features a moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 70 percent off moderate department and discount store regular prices 

 

the dd’s discounts business generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of ross but features a different mix of brands at lower average price points the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood the merchant store and distribution organizations for dd’s discounts and ross are separate and distinct however dd’s discounts shares certain other corporate and support services with ross

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

overview 

 

we are the second largest offprice apparel and home goods retailer in the united states at the end of fiscal 2009 we operated 953 ross dress for less “ross” locations in 27 states and guam and 52 dd’s discounts stores in four states ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 60 percent off department and specialty store regular prices dd’s discounts features a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 70 percent off moderate department and discount store regular prices 

 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to maintain or improve profitability and improve financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry total aggregate sales for five of the largest offprice retailers in the united states increased 7 during 2009 on top of a 3 increase in 2008 this compares to total national apparel sales which declined 5 during 2009 compared to a 3 decline in 2008 according to data published by the npd group inc which provides global sales and marketing information on the retail industry 

 

we believe that the stronger relative sales gains of the offprice retailers during 2009 were driven mainly by the increased focus on value by consumers whose spending continued to be pressured by the challenging macroeconomic environment our sales and earnings gains in 2009 benefited from efficient execution of our resilient and flexible offprice business model our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of our offprice industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday discounts 

 

looking ahead to 2010 we are planning to maintain tight controls of both inventory levels and operating expenses as part of our strategy to help us maximize our profitability 

 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 30 2010 january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 as fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 were 52 weeks 

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal years ended 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

stores total stores open at the end of 2009 2008 and 2007 were 1005 956 and 890 respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 increased by 5 7 and 12 from the respective prior years our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 

 

 

sales sales for fiscal 2009 increased 6981 million or 108 compared to the prior year due to the opening of 49 net new stores during 2009 and a 6 increase in sales from “comparable” stores defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2008 increased 5109 million or 86 compared to the prior year due to the opening of 66 net new stores during 2008 and a 2 increase in sales from comparable stores 

 

 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

we expect to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization to diversify our merchandise mix and to more fully develop our organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or an increase in net earnings 

 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2009 increased 3707 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 49 net new stores during the year and a 6 increase in sales from comparable stores 

 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2009 decreased approximately 230 basis points from the prior year this improvement was mainly the result of a 170 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin which includes a 40 basis point benefit from lower shortage in addition freight costs declined by about 50 basis points occupancy leveraged 35 basis points and distribution costs declined by about 10 basis points these improvements were partially offset by a 35 basis point increase in buying expenses due in part to higher incentive costs versus the prior year 

 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2008 increased 3384 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 66 net new stores during the year and a 2 increase in sales from comparable stores 

 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2008 decreased approximately 90 basis points from the prior year this improvement was mainly the result of a 100 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin in addition distribution costs for the year improved by about 20 basis points as a percent of sales these favorable trends were partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in occupancy expense and a 20 basis point increase in incentive costs 

 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 will continue in future years 

 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009 selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 965 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 49 net new stores during the year 

 

sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2009 decreased by approximately 20 basis points compared to the prior year this decrease was mainly driven by 40 basis points of leverage on store operating expenses partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in general and administrative expenses due in part to higher incentive costs versus the prior year 

 

for fiscal 2008 sga increased 985 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 66 net new stores during the year 

 

 

sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2008 grew by approximately 30 basis points over the prior year this increase was mainly driven by a 20 basis point increase in store operating expenses and a 10 basis point increase in general and administrative costs as a percent of sales 

 

the largest component of sga is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime as of fiscal year end 2009 2008 and 2007 was approximately 45600 40000 and 39100 respectively 

 

interest expense income net in fiscal 2009 interest expense increased by 11 million primarily due to lower capitalization of construction interest in fiscal 2009 interest income decreased by 67 million primarily due to lower investment yields as compared to the prior year as a percentage of sales net interest expense in fiscal 2009 decreased pretax earnings by approximately 10 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year the table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

taxes on earnings our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 was approximately 38 38 and 39 respectively which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is affected by changes in law location of new stores level of earnings and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 will be in the range of 38 to 39 

 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2009 were higher compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2008 were higher compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales partially offset by higher sga expenses as a percentage of sales 

 

earnings per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 was 354 compared to 233 in fiscal 2008 this 52 increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 45 increase in net earnings and a 5 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2008 was 233 compared to 190 in fiscal 2007 this 23 increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 17 increase in net earnings and a 4 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

 

merchandise inventory our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost basis we purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway inventory accounted for approximately 38 of total inventories as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 merchandise inventory includes acquisition processing and storage costs related to packaway inventory 

 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

 

longlived assets we record a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 

 

depreciation and amortization expense property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real property the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term 

 

lease accounting when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we amortize deferred rent on a straightline basis over the lease term commencing on the possession date tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

selfinsurance we self insure certain of our workers’ compensation and general liability risks as well as certain coverages under our health plans our selfinsurance liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

 

stockbased compensation we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards typically over the vesting period we use historical data to estimate prevesting forfeitures and to recognize stockbased compensation expense all stockbased compensation awards are expensed over the service or performance periods of the awards 

 

income taxes we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures our policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 

 

 

the critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

 

effects of inflation or deflation we do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asc 810 originally issued as sfas no 167 “amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r” among other things asc 810 responds to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of fin 46r including those regarding the transparency of the involvement with variable interest entities asc 810 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 we do not believe the adoption of asc 810 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

forwardlooking statements 

 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2009 and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases telephonic reports and other investor communications including on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict as a result our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd’s discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we do not undertake to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of january 30 2010 

 

  

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 30 2010 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility in addition lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 

 

in addition we issued notes to institutional investors in two series series a for 85 million accrues interest at 638 and series b for 65 million accrues interest at 653 the amount outstanding under these notes as of january 30 2010 is 150 million 

 

interest is receivable on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended january 30 2010 we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements it should be noted that any system of controls however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met in addition the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

 

quarterly evaluation of changes in internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two chains of offprice retail apparel and home accessories stores at january 31 2009 we operated a total of 956 stores of which 904 were ross dress for less ® “ross” locations in 27 states and guam and 52 were dd’s discounts ® stores in four states both chains target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 ross target customers are primarily from middle income households while the dd’s discounts target customer is typically from more moderate income households the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are aimed at these customer bases 

ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices dd’s discounts features more moderatelypriced assortments of firstquality inseason name brand and fashion apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices we believe that both ross and dd’s discounts derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store meet customer needs on a more local basis deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets we refer to our fiscal years ended january 31 2009 february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 as fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brandname and fashion apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brandname merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our ross merchandising strategy is reflected in our television advertising for our ross stores which emphasizes a strong value message  our customers will find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brandname merchandise 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brandname label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection of brand names within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item the mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal 2008 was approximately as follows ladies 32 home accents and bed and bath 23 mens 14 accessories lingerie fine jewelry and fragrances 12 shoes 10 and children’s 9 our merchandise offerings also include product categories such as small furniture and furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware watches sporting goods and in select ross stores fine jewelry 

purchasing we have a combined network of approximately 7200 merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe that our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brandname and fashion merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department specialty and discount stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department and specialty stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the vast majority of the apparel and apparelrelated merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout and packaway purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2008 we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 38 of total inventories as of january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 we believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

we continue to roll out additional information system enhancements and process changes to improve our merchandising capabilities these new tools are designed to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate at a more local versus regional level we expect to complete the chainwide rollout to all merchandise categories in fiscal 2010 the longterm objective of these investments is to fine tune our merchandise offerings to address more localized customer preferences and thereby gradually increase sales productivity and gross profit margins in both newer and existing regions and markets 

our buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships  a key element in the success of our offprice buying strategies   

at the end of fiscal 2008 we had a total of approximately 360 merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined although the two buying organizations are separate and distinct these buying resources include merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have an average of about 12 years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as ann taylor bloomingdales burlington coat factory foot locker kohl’s loehmann’s lord  taylor macys marshalls nordstrom saks tj maxx and value city we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandise organization to further develop our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors our ongoing objective is to enhance our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

the offprice buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brandname merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brandname product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department and specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices on a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

at january 31 2009 we operated a total of 956 stores comprised of 904 ross stores and 52 dd’s discounts stores our stores are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market permits we cluster stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management 

we believe a key element of our success is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments at both ross and dd’s discounts which allow customers to shop at their own pace our stores are designed for customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas each stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we encourage our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers promoting a selfservice atmosphere at most stores shopping carts are available at the entrance for customer convenience all cash registers are centrally located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing 

we use pointofsale “pos” hardware and software systems in all stores which minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing credit for personal checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds in addition the pos systems allow us to accept pinbased debit cards and electronic gift cards from customers for ross and dd’s discounts combined approximately 58 of payments in fiscal 2008 and 56 of payments in fiscal 2007 were made with credit cards and debit cards we provide cash or credit card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or credited with a credit voucher at the price on the receipt 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to keep operating costs low are 

labor costs that generally are lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to i a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and ii the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs as a result of centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions flexible store layout criteria which facilitates conversion of existing buildings to our format information systems 

in fiscal 2008 we continued to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include the following 

we completed development and began the rollout of demand forecasting software and related process changes designed to strengthen our merchandise planning effectiveness we expect this initiative to drive gradual increases in store sales productivity and profitability by improving our ability to plan buy and allocate product at a more local level we plan to complete this rollout in fiscal 2010 we implemented additional supply chain enhancements to support expansion of processing and storage facilities and to increase operating efficiency these improvements included the expansion of a distribution center and enhanced warehouse management functionality we completed the rollout of new tools to better support the continued growth of our import business these new tools provide our merchants with greater visibility into item cost components and inbound movement of import products we completed a project to implement new labor standards across our entire store base as part of this project we developed tools to more effectively generate store schedules by optimizing instore tasks available resources and planned payroll budgets we completed a project to implement new online tools to assist our stores in their recruiting and hiring efforts these new tools are designed to help our store managers expedite the hiring process and increase the quality of hiring decisions we implemented additional enhancements to our pos systems to reduce customer transaction and wait times we upgraded our loss prevention software to allow for greater indepth analysis and reporting and completed the rollout of additional store video surveillance systems to provide corporate and centralized remote monitoring we completed a project to integrate our systems with a third party payment services network to streamline our invoice processing and payment process this project provides us with new capabilities which we are using to help lower our invoice processing costs and to increase our cash management efficiency distribution 

we have a total of four distribution processing facilities we lease a 13 million square foot distribution center in perris california we own a 13 million square foot distribution center in fort mill south carolina a 685000 square foot distribution center in moreno valley california and a 426000 square foot distribution center located in carlisle pennsylvania we currently have under construction a 610000 square foot expansion of our moreno valley california distribution center scheduled for completion in 2009 see additional discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

in addition we own one facility and lease three other warehouse facilities for packaway storage two of which are located in carlisle pennsylvania totaling approximately 239000 and 246000 square feet and two of which are located in fort mill south carolina totaling 253000 and 423000 owned facility square feet respectively we utilize other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory we also lease a 10acre parcel of land that has been developed for trailer parking adjacent to our perris california distribution center 

6   

in october 2008 we purchased 160 acres of land in south carolina with the intention of building a new distribution center in the future 

we utilize thirdparty cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our existing distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support store growth over the next few years 

advertising 

we rely primarily on television advertising to communicate the ross value proposition  brandname merchandise at low everyday prices this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and costeffective medium for communicating everyday savings on a wide selection of brandname bargains for both the family and home advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local community initiatives 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross dress for less ® and dd’s discounts ® have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of january 31 2009 we had approximately 40000 total employees including an estimated 26500 parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees  especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home accessories industry are offering significant discounts on brandname merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment appealing to our target customer and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we continue to make strategic investments in our buying organization as discussed under information systems we are also in the process of completing the rollout in fiscal 2010 of additional enhancements to our merchandise planning system to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face a challenging macroeconomic environment that creates intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than we do we also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home accessories through catalogs or over the internet the retail apparel business may become even more competitive in the future 

dd’s discounts 

we began the dd’s discounts concept in 2004 with ten initial locations in california and as of january 31 2009 operated 52 dd’s discounts stores in four states this smaller offprice concept targets the needs of households with more moderate incomes than ross customers  we believe this is one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country dd’s discounts features a moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand and fashion apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices     

the dd’s discounts business generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of ross but features a different mix of brands at lower average price points the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood the merchant store and distribution organizations for dd’s discounts and ross are separate and distinct however dd’s discounts shares certain other corporate and support services with ross

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are the second largest offprice apparel and home goods retailer in the united states at the end of fiscal 2008 we operated 904 ross dress for less “ross” locations in 27 states and guam and 52 dd’s discounts stores in four states ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices dd’s discounts features a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to drive gains in profitability and improved financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry total aggregate sales for the five largest offprice retailers in the united states increased 3 during 2008 on top of a 6 increase in 2007 this compares to total national apparel sales which declined 4 during 2008 compared to a 4 increase in 2007 according to data published by the npd group which provides global sales and marketing information on the retail industry 

the macroeconomic and retail climate became more difficult as the year progressed in 2008 we believe that the stronger relative sales gains of the offprice retailers during the year reflected the increasing importance of value to consumers especially as the recessionary headwinds accelerated our sales and earnings gains in 2008 benefited from efficient execution of our resilient and flexible offprice business model our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of our offprice industry as well as continued customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday discounts 

looking ahead to 2009 we expect the macroeconomic pressures to continue and are planning to maintain tight controls of both inventory levels and operating expenses as part of our strategy to help us maximize our profitability 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 31 2009 february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 as fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively fiscal 2006 was 53 weeks fiscal 2008 and 2007 were 52 weeks 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal years ended january 31 2009 february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 

 17 

stores total stores open at the end of 2008 2007 and 2006 were 956 890 and 797 respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 increased by 7 12 and 9 from the respective prior years our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition expected store profitability and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2008 increased 5109 million or 86 compared to the prior year due to the opening of 66 net new stores during 2008 and a 2 increase in sales from “comparable” stores defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2007 increased 4050 million or 73 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 93 net new stores during 2007 and a 1 increase in sales from comparable stores 

our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 



we expect to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization to diversify our merchandise mix and to more fully develop our organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or an increase in net earnings 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2008 increased 3384 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 66 net new stores during the year and a 2 increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2008 decreased approximately 90 basis points from the prior year this improvement was mainly the result of a 100 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin as a percent of sales in addition distribution costs for the year improved by about 20 basis points as a percent of sales these favorable trends were partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in occupancy expense and a 20 basis point increase in incentive costs 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2007 increased 3007 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 93 net new stores during the year and a 1 increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007 decreased approximately 20 basis points from the prior year this improvement was mainly the result of a 20 basis point improvement in merchandise gross margin primarily due to lower markdowns and shortage as a percent of sales 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008 selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 985 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 66 net new stores during the year 

sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2008 grew by approximately 30 basis points over the prior year this increase was mainly driven by a 20 basis point increase in store operating expenses and a 10 basis point increase in general and administrative costs as a percent of sales 

for fiscal 2007 sga increased 729 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 93 net new stores during the year 

sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007 grew by approximately 15 basis points over the prior year this increase was mainly driven by a 40 basis point rise in store operating expenses store operating costs in 2007 were impacted by minimum wage increases and the deleveraging effect of the 1 gain in comparable store sales these cost pressures were partially offset by a 25 basis point decline in other general and administrative costs 

the largest component of sga is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime as of fiscal year end 2008 2007 and 2006 was approximately 40000 39100 and 35800 respectively 

interest in fiscal 2008 interest expense decreased by 15 million primarily due to higher capitalization of construction interest in fiscal 2008 interest income decreased by 53 million primarily due to lower investment yields as compared to the prior year as a percentage of sales the reduction in net interest income in fiscal 2008 decreased pretax earnings by approximately 10 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year the table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

taxes on earnings our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 was approximately 38 39 and 39 respectively which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is affected by changes in law location of new stores level of earnings and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 will be in the range of 38 to 40 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2008 were higher compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales partially offset by higher sga expenses as a percentage of sales net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007 were higher compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales partially offset by higher sga expenses as a percentage of sales 

earnings per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2008 were 233 compared to 190 in fiscal 2007 this 23 increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 17 increase in net earnings and a 4 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 were 190 compared to 170 in fiscal 2006 on a 53week basis this 12 increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 8 increase in net earnings and a 3 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores and investments in distribution centers and information systems we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost basis we purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets we record a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2008 2007 or 2006 

depreciation and amortization expense property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real property the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term 

lease accounting when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we amortize deferred rent on a straightline basis over the lease term commencing on the possession date tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

selfinsurance we self insure certain of our workers’ compensation and general liability risks as well as certain coverages under our health plans our selfinsurance liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123r the determination of the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions as to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior the riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

sfas no 123r requires companies to estimate future expected forfeitures at the date of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting forfeitures and to recognize stockbased compensation expense all stockbased compensation awards are expensed over the service or performance periods of the awards 

income taxes we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 which supplements sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas no 109 effective february 4 2007 fin 48 clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company’s consolidated financial statements fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold of morelikelythannot and a measurement standard for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

the critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

effects of inflation or deflation we do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations 

new accounting pronouncements 

sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” is effective for financial assets and liabilities for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 except for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis for which application was deferred for one year sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements 

sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas no 159” is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 sfas no 159 establishes a fair value option under which entities can elect to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 

we adopted sfas no 157 and sfas no 159 effective february 3 2008 adoption of the deferred provisions of sfas 157 will not have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2008 and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases telephonic reports and other investor communications including on our corporate website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “target” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict as a result our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd’s discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we do not undertake to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of january 31 2009 

interest payable on our revolving credit facilities is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 31 2009 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities in addition lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 

in addition we issued notes to institutional investors in two series series a for 85 million accrues interest at 638 and series b for 65 million accrues interest at 653 the amount outstanding under these notes as of january 31 2009 is 150 million 

interest is receivable on our short and longterm investments changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future or the fair value of our investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or the fair values of our short and longterm investments as of and for the year ended january 31 2009 we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two chains of offprice retail apparel and home accessories stores at february 2 2008 we operated a total of 890 stores of which 838 are ross dress for less ® “ross” locations in 27 states and guam and 52 are dd’s discounts ® stores in four states both chains target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 ross target customers are primarily from middle income households while the dd’s discounts target customer is typically from more moderate income households the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are aimed at these customer bases 

ross offers firstquality inseason namebrand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices dd’s discounts features more moderatelypriced assortments of firstquality inseason namebrand and fashion apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices we believe that both ross and dd’s discounts derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

achieve an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store meet customer needs on a more local basis deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets the original ross stores inc was incorporated in california in 1957 in august 1982 the company was purchased by some of our then and current directors and stockholders in june 1989 we reincorporated in the state of delaware in 2004 we opened our first dd’s discounts locations 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 2 2008 february 3 2007 and january 28 2006 as fiscal 2007 fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brandname and fashion apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable brandname merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our ross merchandising strategy is reflected in our television advertising for our ross stores which emphasizes a strong value message  our customers will find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brandname merchandise 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brandname label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection of brand names within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item the mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal 2007 for ross was approximately as follows ladies 32 home accents and bed and bath 23 mens 15 fine jewelry accessories lingerie and fragrances 11 shoes 10 and children’s 9 our merchandise offerings also include product categories such as small furniture and furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware watches sporting goods and in select ross stores fine jewelry 

purchasing we have a combined network of approximately 6400 merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe that our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brandname and fashion merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department and specialty stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances coop advertising allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the vast majority of the merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout and packaway purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods into our stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2007 we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 38 of total inventories as of february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 we believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results 

we are currently working to develop and rollout additional information system enhancements and process changes to improve our merchandising capabilities these new tools are designed to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate at a more local versus regional level the longterm objective of these investments is to be able to fine tune our merchandise offerings to address more localized customer preferences and thereby gradually increase sales productivity and gross profit margins in both newer and existing regions and markets 

our buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships  a key element in the success of our offprice buying strategies 

we have a total of approximately 330 merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined although the two buying organizations are separate and distinct these buying resources include merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have an average of about 14 years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as ann taylor bloomingdales burlington coat factory foot locker kohl’s loehmann’s lord  taylor macys marshalls nordstrom saks tj maxx and value city we believe that the investment we have made over the years in our merchandise organization enables our merchants to spend more time in the market developing and nurturing relationships with a wide array of manufacturers and vendors enhancing our ability to continue to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

our offprice buying strategies and our experienced merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brandname merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brandname product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department andor specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices we review specified departments in the stores weekly for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

at february 2 2008 we operated a total of 890 stores comprised of 838 ross stores and 52 dd’s discounts stores our stores are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market permits we cluster stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management 

we believe a key element of our success is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments at both ross and dd’s discounts which allow customers to shop at their own pace our stores are designed for customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas each stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we encourage our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers promoting a selfservice atmosphere at most stores shopping carts are available at the entrance for customer convenience all cash registers are centrally located at store entrances for customer ease and efficient staffing 

we use pointofsale “pos” hardware and software systems in all stores which minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing credit for personal checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds in addition the pos systems allow us to accept pinbased debit cards and electronic gift cards from customers for ross and dd’s discounts combined approximately 56 of payments in fiscal 2007 and 55 of payments in 2006 were made with credit cards and debit cards we provide cash or credit card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or credited with a credit voucher at the price on the receipt 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled us to keep operating costs low are 

labor costs that generally are lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to i a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and ii the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs as a result of centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions flexible store layout criteria which facilitates conversion of existing buildings to our format distribution 

we have a total of four distribution processing facilities we lease a 13 million square foot distribution center in perris california we own our 13 million square foot distribution center in fort mill south carolina our 685000 square foot distribution center in moreno valley california and our 450000 square foot distribution center located in carlisle pennsylvania we currently have under construction a 610000 square foot expansion of our moreno valley california distribution center scheduled for completion in 2009 see additional discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

in addition we lease four separate warehouse facilities for packaway storage two of which are located in carlisle pennsylvania totaling approximately 239000 and 246000 square feet and two of which are located in fort mill south carolina totaling 253000 and 423000 square feet respectively we utilize other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory we also lease a 10acre parcel which we currently have under construction for future trailer parking adjacent to our perris distribution center 

we utilize thirdparty cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to six times per week depending on location 

we believe that our existing distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support store growth over the next several years 

information systems 

in fiscal 2007 we continued to invest in new systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include the following 

we introduced a chain level update to our store network to increase communication bandwidth while decreasing monthly recurring costs this improvement allowed us to deploy additional capabilities in the stores and to improve operational efficiencies we completed the majority of the development efforts related to testing and piloting new demand forecasting software and related process changes that are designed to strengthen our merchandising capabilities the projected benefit from these new tools is more effective merchandise planning and trending processes for both sales and inventory we believe this initiative will lead to gradual increases in store sales productivity and profitability across the chain by improving our ability to plan buy and allocate product at a more local or even store level we plan to gradually roll out these capabilities over the next few years we began developing new capabilities to better support the continued growth of our import businesses these improvements are designed to give our merchants greater visibility into item cost components and inbound movement of import products we plan to roll out these new capabilities in fiscal 2008 we implemented additional enhancements to our supply chain systems in order to decrease monthly recurring costs and to support expansion of processing and storage facilities these improvements provided increased supply chain visibility and improved freight routing capabilities we implemented enhancements to our pos systems in order to reduce customer transaction and wait times we upgraded our loss prevention software to allow for additional analysis and reporting while also connecting a number of our store video surveillance systems to provide corporate remote access advertising 

we rely primarily on television advertising to communicate the ross value proposition  brandname merchandise at low everyday prices this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and costeffective medium for communicating everyday savings on a wide selection of brandname bargains for both the family and home advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local community initiatives 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross dress for less ® and dd’s discounts ® have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of february 2 2008 we had approximately 39100 total employees including an estimated 25300 parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees  especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home accessories industry are offering significant discounts on brandname merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment appealing to our target customer and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we have invested in our buying organization and developed a merchandise allocation system to distribute product based on regional factors as well as other systems and procedures to maximize cost efficiencies and leverage expenses in an effort to mitigate competitive pressures on gross margin as discussed under information systems we are also in the process of rolling out over the next few years additional enhancements to our merchandise planning system to strengthen our ability to plan buy and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends we believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

nevertheless the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than we do we also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home accessories through catalogs or over the internet the retail apparel business may become even more competitive in the future 

dd’s discounts 

as of february 2 2008 we operated 52 dd’s discounts stores in four states this newer offprice concept targets the needs of households with more moderate incomes we believe this is one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country dd’s discounts features a moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason namebrand and fashion apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices we opened ten initial locations in california during the second half of 2004 another ten stores in 2005 six stores during fiscal 2006 and 26 stores during fiscal 2007 this business generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of ross but features a different mix of brands consisting mostly of moderate department store and discount store labels at lower average price points the typical dd’s discounts store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood the merchant store and distribution organizations for dd’s discounts and ross are separate and distinct however dd’s discounts shares certain other corporate and support services with ross

our real estate strategy in 2008 and 2009 is to open additional stores in existing states to increase our market penetration and to reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market important considerations in evaluating a new store location are the availability and quality of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the local trade area in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are the second largest offprice apparel and home goods retailer in the united states at the end of fiscal 2007 there were 838 ross dress for less “ross” locations in 27 states and guam and 52 dd’s discounts stores in four states ross offers firstquality inseason namebrand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices dd’s discounts features a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason namebrand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices 

our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing offprice strategies to drive gains in profitability and improved financial returns over the long term in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry total aggregate sales for the five largest offprice retailers in the united states grew 6 during 2007 on top of an 8 increase in 2006 we believe this solid growth reflects the ongoing importance of value to consumers our strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of our offprice industry as well as continued customer demand for namebrand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday discounts 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 2 2008 february 3 2007 and january 28 2006 as fiscal 2007 fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively fiscal 2006 was 53 weeks fiscal 2007 and 2005 were 52 weeks 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal years ended february 2 2008 february 3 2007 and january 28 2006 

 17 

stores total stores open at the end of 2007 2006 and 2005 were 890 797 and 734 respectively the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 increased by 12 9 and 13 from the respective prior years our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration local demographic characteristics competition and the ability to leverage overhead expenses we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 



sales sales for fiscal 2007 increased 4050 million or 73 compared to the prior year due to the opening of 93 net new stores during 2007 and a 1 increase in sales from “comparable” stores defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for fiscal 2006 increased 6260 million or 127 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 63 net new stores during 2006 and a 4 increase in sales from comparable stores 

our sales mix for ross is shown below for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 



we expect to address the competitive climate for offprice apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization to diversify the merchandise mix and to more fully develop the organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or an increase in net earnings 

stockbased compensation effective in fiscal 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r and elected to adopt the standard using the modified prospective transition method this new accounting standard requires recognition of compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of all stockbased awards typically amortized over the vesting period the impact on results for fiscal 2006 was to decrease earnings before taxes by approximately 132 million and net income by approximately 80 million 

see notes a and c in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our stockbased compensation plans and implementation of sfas no 123r 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal 2007 increased 3007 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 93 net new stores during the year and a 1 increase in sales from comparable stores 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007 decreased approximately 20 basis points from the prior year this improvement was mainly the result of a 20 basis point improvement in merchandise margin primarily due to lower markdowns and shortage as a percent of sales 

cost of goods sold in fiscal 2006 increased 4649 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 63 net new stores during the year a 4 increase in sales from comparable stores and additional stock compensation expenses recognized pursuant to sfas no 123r 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2006 decreased approximately 40 basis points compared with the same period in the prior year this improvement was driven mainly by a 40 basis point improvement in merchandise gross margin primarily due to lower markdowns and shortage as a percent of sales and a 35 basis point improvement in distribution costs these gains were partially offset by an approximate 25 basis point increase in freight costs and a 10 basis point increase in expenses related to sfas no 123r 

we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 729 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 93 net new stores during the year 

sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007 grew by approximately 15 basis points over the prior year this increase was mainly driven by a 40 basis point rise in store operating expenses compared to fiscal 2006 which benefited from leverage related to the 53 rd week store operating costs in 2007 were also impacted by minimum wage increases and the deleveraging effect of the 1 gain in comparable store sales these cost pressures were partially offset by a 25 basis point decline in other general and administrative costs 

for fiscal 2006 sga increased 969 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 63 net new stores during the year 

for fiscal 2006 sga as a percentage of sales was unchanged compared to the same period in the prior year an approximately 15 basis point increase in expense related to sfas no 123r and a 5 basis point increase in store related expenses were offset by a 20 basis point decrease in other general and administrative costs related to lower workers’ compensation costs and leverage on the 53 rd week of operations in fiscal 2006 

the largest component of sga is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime as of fiscal year end 2007 2006 and 2005 was approximately 39100 35800 and 33200 respectively 

interest in fiscal 2007 interest expense increased 69 million due to higher average borrowings as compared to the prior year and interest income increased 23 million due to higher cash and investment balances as compared to the prior year as a percentage of sales the reduction in net interest income in fiscal 2007 decreased pretax earnings by approximately 10 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year the table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 



taxes on earnings our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 was approximately 39 which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns the effective rate is affected by changes in law location of new stores level of earnings and the result of tax audits we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 will be in the range of 38 to 40 

net earnings net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007 were higher compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales partially offset by higher sga expenses as a percentage of sales net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2006 were higher compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold and higher interest income as a percentage of sales while sga expenses as a percentage of sales remained unchanged 

earnings per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 were 190 compared to 170 in fiscal 2006 on a 53week basis this 12 increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 8 increase in net earnings and a 3 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006 were 170 compared to 136 in fiscal 2005 this 25 increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 21 increase in net earnings and a 3 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store merchandise inventory purchases capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores and investments in distribution centers information systems and infrastructure we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends 

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3536 million 5069 million and 3752 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the primary source of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 was net earnings plus noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization partially offset by cash used to finance merchandise inventory the increase in cash flow from operating activities resulted from an increase in accounts payable in 2006 over 2005 of 2216 million primarily driven by timing associated with the additional 53 rd week in fiscal 2006 

working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was 3874 million at the end of fiscal 2007 compared to 4317 million at the end of fiscal 2006 and 3499 million at the end of fiscal 2005 the decrease in working capital in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to lower cash and investments and timing associated with the additional 53 rd week in fiscal 2006 the increase in working capital in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is primarily due to higher cash and investments 

our primary source of liquidity is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns

other activities 

distribution center purchase in may 2006 we exercised our option to purchase our fort mill south carolina distribution center and paid cash in the amount of 873 million to acquire the facility from the lessor we estimated the fair value of the components of the facility and the related equipment using various valuation techniques including appraisals market prices and cost data the amounts we recorded for each component were based on these fair value estimates 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost basis we purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year 

included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets we record a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2007 2006 or 2005 

depreciation and amortization expense property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real property the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term 

lease accounting when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we amortize deferred rent on a straightline basis over the lease term commencing on the possession date tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

selfinsurance we self insure certain of our workers’ compensation and general liability risks as well as certain coverages under our health plans our selfinsurance liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123r 

the determination of the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan “espp” shares using the blackscholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions as to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior the riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

sfas no 123r requires companies to estimate future expected forfeitures at the date of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in previous fiscal years we had recognized the impact of forfeitures as they occurred starting in fiscal 2006 we use historical data to estimate prevesting forfeitures and to recognize stockbased compensation expense all stockbased compensation awards are amortized on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards 

income taxes we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 which supplements sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas no 109 effective february 4 2007 fin 48 clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company’s consolidated financial statements fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold of morelikelythannot and a measurement standard for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

the critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

effects of inflation or deflation we do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations 

new accounting pronouncements 

sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 157 will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 

sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas no 159” is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 sfas no 159 establishes a fair value option under which entities can elect to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 159 will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2007 and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases telephonic reports and other investor communications including on our website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict as a result our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd’s discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we do not undertake to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of february 2 2008 

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facilities is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates in addition lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of february 2 2008 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities in addition we issued notes to institutional investors in two series series a for 850 million accrues interest at 638 and series b for 650 million accrues interest at 653 the amount outstanding under these notes as of february 2 2008 is 1500 million 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as of and for the year ended february 2 2008 we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two chains of offprice retail apparel and home accessories stores at february 3 2007 there were 771 ross dress for less ® “ross” locations in 27 states and guam and 26 dd’s discounts ® stores in california both chains target valueconscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54 ross customers are primarily from middle income households while the dd’s discounts target customer is typically from lower income households the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are aimed at these customer bases 

ross offers firstquality inseason namebrand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices dd’s discounts features more moderatelypriced assortments of firstquality inseason namebrand and fashion apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices we believe that both ross and dd’s discounts derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easytoshop store environments 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

achieve an appropriate level of recognizable brands labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store meet customer needs on a more regional and local basis deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all of our markets the original ross stores inc was incorporated in california in 1957 in august 1982 the company was purchased by some of our then and current directors and stockholders in june 1989 we reincorporated in the state of delaware in 2004 we opened our first dd’s discounts locations 

we refer to our fiscal years ended february 3 2007 january 28 2006 and january 29 2005 as fiscal 2006 fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brandname and fashion apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 below regular department and specialty store prices at ross and 20 to 70 below moderate department and discount store prices at dd’s discounts we sell recognizable branded merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to five times per week at both ross and dd’s discounts stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our ross merchandising strategy is reflected in our television advertising for our ross stores which emphasizes a strong value message  our customers will find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brandname merchandise 

merchandising our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise for both ross and dd’s discounts we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brandname label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection of brand names within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item over the past several years we have diversified our merchandise offerings by adding new product categories such as maternity small furniture and furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware watches sporting goods and in select ross stores fine jewelry the mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal 2006 for ross was approximately as follows ladies 33 home accents and bed and bath 22 mens 15 fine jewelry accessories lingerie and fragrances 11 shoes 10 and children’s 9 

purchasing we have a combined network of approximately 6000 vendors and manufacturers for both ross and dd’s discounts and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe that our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brandname and fashion merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores for ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department and specialty stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional and markdown allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the vast majority of the merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout and packaway purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods in our stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in fiscal 2006 we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 38 of total inventories as of february 3 2007 compared to 41 at the end of the prior year we believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are a key driver of our business 

we are currently working to improve our analytical capabilities for merchandise planning buying and allocation through the development of new processes and systems enhancements that are expected over the next few years to address more localized customer preferences the longterm objective of these investments is to finetune our merchandise offerings at a more local level to improve sales productivity and gross profit margins once fully implemented these new analytical capabilities and systems enhancements are also expected to provide us with the tools to improve over time store sales productivity and profitability in both newer and existing regions and markets 

our buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships  a key element in the success of our offprice buying strategies 

we have a total of approximately 300 merchants for ross and dd’s discounts combined although the two buying organizations are separate and distinct these buying resources include merchandise management buyers and assistant buyers ross and dd’s discounts buyers have an average of about 13 years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdales burlington coat factory dayton hudson foot locker kohl’s lechters lord  taylor macys marshalls nordstrom robinsonsmay sterns tj maxx and value city we believe that the investment we have made over the years in our merchandise organization enables our merchants to spend more time in the market developing and nurturing relationships with a wide array of manufacturers and vendors enhancing our ability to continue to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts 

our offprice buying strategies and our experienced teams of merchants enable us to purchase ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and dd’s discounts merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores 

pricing our policy is to sell brandname merchandise at ross that is priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices at dd’s discounts we sell more moderate brandname product and fashions that are priced 20 to 70 below most moderate department and discount store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department andor specialty stores for ross merchandise or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s discounts merchandise 

our pricing strategy at ross differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices we review specified departments in the stores weekly for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh merchandise a similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s discounts where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores 

stores 

at february 3 2007 we operated a total of 797 stores of which 771 are ross stores and 26 are dd’s discounts stores our stores are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood strip shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market permits we cluster stores to maximize economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management 

we believe a key element of our success is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environments at both ross and dd’s discounts which allow customers to shop at their own pace our stores are designed for customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas each stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we encourage our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers promoting a selfservice atmosphere at most stores shopping carts baskets andor shopping bags are available at the entrance for customer convenience all cash registers are centrally located at store entrances for customer ease and efficient staffing 

the company uses pointofsale “pos” hardware and software systems in all stores which minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing credit for personal checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds in addition the pos systems allow us to accept pinbased debit cards and electronic gift cards from customers on a combined basis approximately 55 of payments in fiscal 2006 and 54 of payments in 2005 were made with credit cards and debit cards we provide cash or credit card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or credited with a credit voucher at the price on the receipt 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled the company to operate at low costs are 

labor costs that generally are lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to i a store design that creates a selfservice retail format and ii the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs as a result of centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions flexible store layout criteria which facilitates conversion of existing buildings to our format 3

we have a total of four distribution processing facilities we lease a 13 million square foot distribution center in perris california we own our 13 million square foot distribution center in fort mill south carolina which we purchased in 2006 our 685000 square foot distribution center in moreno valley california which we purchased in 2005 and our 426000 square foot distribution center located in carlisle pennsylvania we have plans for future expansion at the moreno valley california distribution center see additional discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

in addition we lease three separate warehouse facilities for packaway storage two of which are located in carlisle pennsylvania totaling approximately 239000 and 246000 square feet and the third in fort mill south carolina totaling 253000 square feet we utilize other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory 

in fiscal 2007 we plan to continue to invest in our distribution network by spending approximately 90 million mainly for the expansion of our moreno valley facility to increase our distribution and packaway storage capacity 

we also utilize thirdparty cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to five times per week depending on location 

we believe that our existing distribution centers with their expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support store growth into fiscal year 2008 

information systems 

in fiscal 2006 we continued to invest in new systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include the following 

we implemented additional enhancements to our core merchandising applications in order to support our continued growth we are now in the process of implementing capabilities which we will use to enhance our new store opening process preseason planning and inseason trending we plan to roll out these enhancements over the next few years we introduced a new storelevel task management system which allows us to improve store staff productivity better monitor and address problems and improve twoway communications between corporate personnel and personnel in the field we began a chain level update to our store network in order to increase communication bandwidth while decreasing monthly recurring costs we plan to complete this network upgrade in fiscal 2007 this improvement will open the opportunity to deploy additional capabilities in the stores to streamline internal processes and to improve operational efficiencies we implemented enhancements to our transportation management system these improvements provided increased supply chain visibility and improved freight routing capabilities we implemented additional enhancements to our warehouse management system at all distribution centers these improvements provided increased operational and inventory control as well as improved transaction accountability advertising 

we rely primarily on television advertising to communicate the ross value proposition  brandname merchandise at low everyday prices this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and costeffective medium for communicating everyday savings on a wide selection of brandname bargains for both the family and home advertising for dd’s discounts is primarily focused on new store grand openings 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross dress for less ® and dd’s discounts ® have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

as of february 3 2007 we had approximately 35800 total employees including an estimated 22500 parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees  especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home accessories industry are offering significant discounts on brandname merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment appealing to our target customer and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept we have invested in our buying organization and developed a merchandise allocation system to distribute product based on regional factors as well as other systems and procedures to maximize cost efficiencies and leverage expenses in an effort to mitigate competitive pressures on gross margin we believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

nevertheless the national retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores warehouse stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than we do we also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home accessories through catalogs or over the internet the retail apparel business may become even more competitive in the future 

dd’s discounts 

as of february 3 2007 we operated 26 dd’s discounts stores this newer offprice concept targets the needs of lower income households which we believe to be one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country dd’s discounts features a moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason namebrand and fashion apparel accessories footwear and home merchandise at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices we opened ten initial locations in california during the second half of 2004 another ten stores in 2005 and six stores during fiscal 2006 this business generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of ross but features a different mix of brands consisting mostly of moderate department store and discount store labels at lower average price points the average dd’s discounts store is approximately 27000 gross square feet and is located in an established strip shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood the merchant store and distribution organizations for dd’s discounts and ross are separate and distinct however dd’s discounts shares certain other corporate and support services with ross

our financial condition results of operations cash flows and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors risks and uncertainties that apply to both ross and dd’s discounts include without limitation the following 

we are subject to the economic and industry risks that affect large united states retailers 

our business is exposed to the risks of a large multistore retailer which must continually and efficiently obtain and distribute a supply of fresh merchandise throughout a large and growing network of stores these risks include a number of factors including 

an increase in the level of competitive pressures in the retail apparel or homerelated merchandise industry potential changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel or homerelated merchandise including the potential impact from higher gas prices andor lower home prices on consumer spending potential changes in geopolitical andor general economic conditions that could affect the availability of product andor the level of consumer spending unseasonable weather trends that could affect consumer demand for seasonal apparel and apparelrelated products a change in the availability quantity or quality of attractive brandname merchandise at desirable discounts that could impact our ability to purchase product and continue to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices potential disruptions in the supply chain that could impact our ability to deliver product to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner a change in the availability quality or cost of new store real estate locations a downturn in the economy or a natural disaster in california or in another region where we have a concentration of stores or a distribution center our corporate headquarters two distribution centers and 28 of our stores are located in california potential pressure on freight costs from higherthanexpected fuel surcharges we are subject to operating risks as we attempt to execute our merchandising and growth strategies 

the continued success of our business depends in part upon our ability to increase sales at our existing store locations and to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis our existing strategies and store expansion programs may not result in a continuation of our anticipated revenue growth or profit growth in executing our offprice retail strategies and working to improve our efficiency expand our store network and reduce our costs we face a number of operational risks including 

our ability to attract and retain personnel with the retail expertise necessary to execute our strategies our ability to effectively implement and operate our various supply chain core merchandising and other information systems including generation of all necessary data and reports for merchants allocators and other business users in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to successfully implement new processes and systems enhancements that are expected to improve our merchandising capabilities over the next few years with the goal of being able to plan buy and allocate product at a more local versus regional level our ability to improve new store sales and profitability especially in newer regions and markets our ability to achieve and maintain targeted levels of productivity and efficiency in our distribution centers our ability to continue to acquire or lease acceptable new store locations our ability to identify and to successfully enter new geographic markets lower than planned gross margin including higher than planned markdowns inventory shortage or freight costs greater than planned operating costs including among other factors increases in occupancy costs advertising costs and wage and benefit costs including the impact of changes in labor laws or as a result of class action or other lawsuits relating to wage and hour claims and other laborrelated matters our ability to convert certain former albertsons real estate sites to the ross and dd’s discounts formats in a timely and costeffective manner and on acceptable terms and the ability to achieve targeted levels of sales profits and cash flows from these acquired store locations 6

we carry earthquake insurance to mitigate our risk on our corporate headquarters distribution centers buying offices and all of our stores 

our real estate strategy in 2007 and 2008 is to open additional stores mainly in existing regions to increase our market penetration and to reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market important considerations in evaluating a new market are the availability of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the market in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

in october 2006 we announced an agreement with albertsons llc to acquire certain leasehold rights to 46 former albertsons sites in california florida texas arizona colorado and oklahoma we plan to incorporate about 40 of these sites into our 2007 expansion program this real estate opportunity allowed us to acquire a substantial number of store sites in several of our established top performing markets

where possible we have obtained sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations this has allowed us to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time at reasonable costs in a given market to date we have been able to secure leases in suitable locations for our stores at february 3 2007 the majority of our ross stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years with three to four renewal options of five years each the average unexpired original lease term of our leased stores is six years or 22 years if renewal options are included at february 3 2007 the majority of our dd’s discounts stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from eight to ten years with three to four renewal options of five years each the average unexpired original lease term of our leased stores is nine years or 28 years if renewal options are included see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts as of february 3 2007 

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facilities is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates in addition lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of february 3 2007 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities in addition the company issued notes to institutional investors in two series series a for 850 million accrues interest at 638 and series b for 650 million accrues interest at 653 the amount outstanding under these notes as of february 3 2007 is 1500 million 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as of and for the year ended february 3 2007 we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 

business 

tableend ross stores inc and its subsidiaries “we” or the “company” operate two chains of offprice retail apparel and home accessories stores which target valueconscious men and women between the ages of 25 and 54 primarily in middle income households the decisions we make from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the locations of our stores are aimed at this customer base we offer brandname and designer merchandise at low everyday prices generally 20 to 60 below the regular prices of most department and specialty stores we believe we derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of quality brandname merchandise within each of our merchandise categories in an organized and easytoshop environment 

our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customer by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

 the original ross stores inc was incorporated in california in 1957 in august 1982 the company was purchased by some of our then and current directors and stockholders the original six stores acquired were completely refurbished in our offprice format and stocked with new merchandise in june 1989 we reincorporated in the state of delaware during 2004 we opened our first dd’s discounts ® locations an offprice concept targeted to serve the needs of lower income households 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

we seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brandname apparel accessories footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 below regular department and specialty store prices we sell recognizable branded merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to five times per week at our stores our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising which emphasizes a strong value message  our customers will find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brandname merchandise 

merchandising   our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise we believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success we generally leave the brandname label on the merchandise we sell 

we have established a merchandise assortment that we believe is attractive to our target customer although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores we generally offer a large selection of brand names within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item over the past several years we have diversified our merchandise offerings by adding new product categories such as maternity small furniture or furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware sporting goods and in select stores fine jewelry the mix of comparable store sales by department in 2005 was approximately as follows ladies 34 home accents and bed and bath 21 men’s 16 fine jewelry accessories lingerie and fragrances 11 children’s 9 and shoes 9 

purchasing   we have a network of approximately 4700 vendors and manufacturers and believe we have adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet our requirements we purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

we believe that our ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in our success our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brandname merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department and specialty stores we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional and markdown allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the vast majority of the merchandise that we offer in our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as “closeout” and “packaway” purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing us to get inseason goods in our stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in 2005 we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 41 of total inventories as of january 28 2006 compared to 43 at the end of the prior year we believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are a key driver of our business 

we are currently in the process of improving our existing analytical processes for merchandise planning buying and allocation through the addition of new processes and systems enhancements that are expected to address more localized customer preferences the objective of these investments is to finetune our merchandise offerings at a more local level to improve sales productivity and gross profit margins these new analytical processes and systems enhancements are also expected to provide us with the tools to improve over time store sales productivity and profitability in both newer and existing regions and markets 

our buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nation’s two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships  a key element in the success of our offprice buying strategies 

our buyers have an average of about 14 years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdale’s burlington coat factory dayton hudson foot locker kohl’s lechters lord  taylor macy’s marshalls nordstrom robinsonsmay sterns tj maxx and value city in keeping with our strategy since 1992 our merchandising staff for ross dress for less ® “ross” has grown over fourfold we believe that this increase enables our merchants to spend more time in the market which in turn should strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands at competitive discounts 

these offprice buying strategies enable us to purchase merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores 

pricing   the company’s policy is to sell brandname merchandise priced 20 to 60 below most department and specialty store regular prices our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department andor specialty stores 

our pricing strategy differs from that of a department or specialty store we purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices specified departments in the store are reviewed weekly for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale and the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and accelerate the flow of fresh merchandise

as of january 28 2006 we operated 734 stores of which 714 are ross stores and 20 are dd’s discounts stores our stores are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood strip shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market permits we cluster stores to maximize economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management 

we believe a key element of our success is our organized attractive easytoshop instore environment which allows customers to shop at their own pace our stores are designed for customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas the store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department we encourage our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers promoting a selfservice atmosphere at most stores shopping carts baskets andor shopping bags are available at the entrance for customer convenience all cash registers are centrally located at store entrances for customer ease and efficient staffing 

the company uses pointofsale “pos” hardware and software systems in all stores which minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by using electronic systems for scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing credit for personal checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds in addition the pos systems allow us to accept pinbased debit cards and sell electronic gift cards to customers approximately 54 of payments in 2005 and 52 of payments in 2004 were made with credit cards and debit cards we provide cash or credit card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or credited with a credit voucher at the price on the receipt 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled the company to operate at low costs are 

 distribution 

we have a sourcebased distribution network with a total of four distribution processing facilities strategically located close to the source of inbound merchandise receipts we lease two 13 million square foot distribution centers  one in fort mill south carolina and the other in perris california we own a third 426000 square foot distribution center located in carlisle pennsylvania 

we sold our 530000 square foot newark california distribution center “newark facility” in 2004 and entered into a shortterm lease arrangement to use approximately 154000 square feet of the newark facility to support distribution activities for dd’s discounts 

in addition we lease two warehouses for packaway storage totaling about 485000 square feet in carlisle pennsylvania and 253000 square feet in fort mill south carolina and utilize other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory 

in 2005 we purchased a 685000 square foot warehouse with expansion rights in moreno valley california 

we also utilize thirdparty cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to five times per week depending on location we believe that our existing distribution centers will provide adequate processing capacity to support store growth until 2007 or 2008 

information systems 

during 2005 we continued to invest in new systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include the following 

 advertising 

we rely primarily on television advertising to communicate our value proposition  brandname merchandise at low everyday prices this strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and costeffective medium for communicating everyday savings on a wide selection of brandname bargains for both the family and home 

trademarks 

the trademarks for ross dress for less ® and dd’s discounts ® have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

on january 28 2006 we had approximately 33200 employees which includes an estimated 20200 parttime employees additionally we hire temporary employees  especially during the peak seasons our employees are nonunion management considers the relationship between the company and our employees to be good 

competition 

we believe the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home accessories industry are offering significant discounts on brandname merchandise offering a wellbalanced assortment appealing to our target customer and consistently providing a store environment that is convenient and easytoshop to execute this concept we have strengthened our buying organization and developed a merchandise allocation system to distribute product based on regional factors as well as other systems and procedures to maximize cost efficiencies and leverage expenses in an effort to mitigate competitive pressures on gross margin we believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

nevertheless the national retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive we face intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than we do we also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home accessories through catalogs or over the internet the retail apparel business may become even more competitive in the future 

dd’s discounts 

we operate 20 dd’s discounts stores this newer offprice concept targets the needs of lower income households which we believe to be one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country dd’s discounts features a moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices we opened ten initial stores at locations in california during the second half of 2004 and ten stores during the first nine months of 2005 this new business generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of ross but features a different mix of brands consisting mostly of moderate department store and discount store labels at lower average price points the average dd’s discounts store is approximately 27000 gross square feet and is located in an established strip shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood the merchant store and distribution organizations for dd’s discounts and ross are separate and distinct however dd’s discounts shares certain other corporate and support services with ross

our real estate strategy in 2006 and 2007 is to open additional stores mainly in existing regions to increase our market penetration and reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market important considerations in evaluating a new market are the availability of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the market in addition we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview 

we are the second largest offprice apparel and home goods retailer in the united states with 714 ross stores in 26 states and guam and 20 dd’s discounts store locations in california at january 28 2006 ross offers firstquality inseason name brand and designer apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 60 off department and specialty store regular prices dd’s discounts features a more moderatelypriced assortment of firstquality inseason name brand apparel accessories footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 70 off moderate department and discount store regular prices 

our primary strategy is to pursue and refine our existing offprice business and steadily expand our store base in establishing growth objectives for our business we closely monitor market share trends for the offprice industry sales for the offprice sector grew by 113 during 2005 which is significantly faster than total national apparel sales which grew by 36 according to data from the npd group which provides global sales and marketing information on the retail industry this reflects the ongoing importance of value to consumers our strategies are designed to take advantage of these growth trends and continued customer demand for namebrand fashions for the family and the home at competitive everyday discounts 

we refer to our fiscal years ended january 28 2006 january 29 2005 and january 31 2004 as 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

results of operations 

 15 

stores total stores open at the end of 2005 2004 and 2003 were 734 649 and 568 respectively the number of stores at the end of 2005 2004 and 2003 increased by 13 14 and 12 from the respective prior fiscal years our operating strategy is to open additional stores based on local market penetration the ability to leverage overhead expenses local demographic characteristics including population and competition we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 

 sales sales for 2005 increased 7042 million or 17 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 85 net new stores during 2005 the impact of the stores opened in 2004 and a 6 increase in sales from “comparable” stores defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales for 2004 increased 3194 million or 8 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 81 net new stores during 2004 and the impact of the stores opened in 2003 partially offset by a 1 decrease in sales from comparable stores sales for 2003 increased 3892 million or 11 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 61 net new stores in 2003 the impact of stores opened in 2002 and a 1 increase in sales from comparable stores 

our sales mix is shown below for 2005 2004 and 2003 

 we expect to address the competitive climate for apparel and home goods offprice retailers by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization to diversify the merchandise mix and to more fully develop the organization and systems to strengthen regional and local merchandise offerings although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in 2005 2004 and 2003 we can not be sure that they will result in a continuation of revenue or profit growth 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in 2005 increased 5524 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 85 net new stores during the year the impact of the stores opened in 2004 and increased distribution and logistics costs 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for 2005 increased approximately 15 basis points compared with the same period in the prior year this increase was driven by a 40 basis point decrease in merchandise gross margin mainly due to higher shortage costs in addition higher freight costs drove a 20 basis point increase in distribution and logistics costs as a percent of sales these increases in total cost of goods sold were partially offset by about a 25 basis point decrease in store occupancy costs and a 20 basis point decrease in buying expenses due to leverage from the 6 increase in comparable store sales during the year 

cost of goods sold in 2004 increased 3611 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 81 net new stores during the year the impact of the stores opened in 2003 higher markdowns and increased distribution and logistics costs cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for 2004 increased approximately 290 basis points compared to 2003 due to higher distribution and logistics costs lower merchandise gross margin largely due to higher markdowns and reduced leverage resulting from the 1 decrease in comparable store sales which contributed to higher occupancy and buying expenses as a percentage of sales and buying costs related to the launch of dd’s discounts 

we can not be sure that the gross profit margins realized in 2005 2004 and 2003 will continue in future years 

for fiscal 2006 and future years we expect some decrease in our gross profit margins as a result of increases in our cost of goods sold to reflect a portion of the additional stockbased compensation expenses we will recognize under sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” see the further discussion of sfas no 123r and our expectation regarding the amount of the additional costs under “new accounting pronouncements” also refer to the discussion under “stockbased compensation” in note a to notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our historical pro forma equity compensation cost calculation 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2005 selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 1220 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 85 net new stores during the period in addition to higher incentive plan costs 

for 2005 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased approximately 25 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year this increase is primarily due to an approximate 40 basis point increase relating to higher incentive plan costs and about 30 basis points due to increased information technology costs and related depreciation these higher costs were partially offset by a 35 basis point decrease in store operating and advertising costs and a 10 basis point decrease in other general and administrative expenses which both benefited from leverage on the 6 increase in comparable store sales 

for 2004 sga increased 360 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 81 net new stores during the period partially offset by lower incentive plan costs sga as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 35 basis points primarily due to an approximate 55 basis point decrease in incentive plan costs partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in store payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales 

the largest component of sga is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime at january 28 2006 january 29 2005 and january 31 2004 was approximately 33200 30100 and 26600 respectively 

for fiscal 2006 and future years we expect some increase in our sga to reflect a portion of the additional stockbased compensation expenses we will recognize under sfas no 123r see the further discussion of sfas no 123r and our expectation regarding the amount of the additional costs under “new accounting pronouncements” also refer to the discussion under “stockbased compensation” in note a to notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our historical pro forma equity compensation cost calculation 

interest   in 2005 interest expense increased 11 million and interest income increased 49 million compared to the prior year as a percentage of sales net interest expense income in 2005 remained relatively flat compared to the prior year the table below reflects interest expense and income for 2005 2004 and 2003 

 17 

impairment of longlived assets   during the second quarter of 2004 we relocated our corporate headquarters from newark california to pleasanton california and decided to pursue a sale of our newark california distribution center and corporate headquarters “newark facility” we recognized a noncash impairment charge of 18 million before taxes in the second quarter of 2004 to writedown the carrying value of our newark facility from its net book value of approximately 33 million to the estimated fair value at the time of approximately 15 million during the third quarter of 2004 we sold the newark facility for net proceeds of approximately 17 million we recognized a gain reduction in impairment loss of approximately 2 million in the third quarter of 2004 on this sale for 2004 the net impairment charge recognized was approximately 16 million 

taxes on earnings our effective tax rate for 2005 2004 and 2003 was approximately 39 which represents the applicable federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit realized for state income taxes the effective rate is impacted by changes in law location of new stores level of earnings and the result of tax audits we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 will be approximately 38 to 40 

net earnings   net earnings as a percentage of sales remained flat in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to increased cost of goods sold and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by the absence of an impairment charge and increased interest income as a percentage of sales net earnings as a percentage of sales decreased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales partially offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 

diluted earnings per share in 2005 was 136 compared to 113 in 2004 inclusive of the 06 impairment charge related to the newark facility and 01 related to lease accounting adjustments attributable to the prior year this increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 17 increase in net earnings and a 3 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and shortterm trade credit our primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store merchandise inventory purchases capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores and investments in information systems and infrastructure we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends 

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3752 million 2982 million and 3215 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the primary source of cash from operations in 2005 2004 and 2003 was net earnings plus noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization partially offset by cash used to finance merchandise inventory the increase in cash flows from operations in 2005 is primarily due to an increase in net earnings which is partially offset by the change in cash used for merchandise inventory working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was 350 million at the end of 2005 compared to 416 million at the end of 2004 

and 410 million at the end of 2003 the decrease in working capital in 2005 compared to the prior year is primarily a result of reclassifying a 50 million term loan to current liabilities our primary source of liquidity is the sale of our merchandise inventory we regularly review the age and condition of the merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slowermoving merchandise through clearance markdowns 

investing activities 

in 2005 2004 and 2003 we spent approximately 1759 million 1495 million and 1527 million respectively for capital expenditures excluding leased equipment for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores implement management information technology systems install and implement materials handling equipment and related distribution center systems and various other expenditures related to existing stores buying offices corporate offices and the purchase of a warehouse in moreno valley california we opened 86 84 and 66 new stores and relocated remodeled or expanded 2 3 and 1 stores in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in addition during 2005 we received proceeds from sales of investments of 435 million during 2004 we received approximately 174 million in net proceeds from the sale of the newark facility and invested 674 million in shortterm investments 

we are forecasting approximately 265 million in capital expenditures for 2006 to fund fixtures and leasehold improvements to open both new ross and dd’s discounts stores in addition these capital expenditures are expected to fund the relocation or remodel of existing stores and investments in store and merchandising systems distribution center land buildings equipment and systems and various central office expenditures this capital expenditure forecast assumes we will exercise our right to purchase the leased assets at our fort mill south carolina distribution center we expect to fund these expenditures out of cash flows from operations and existing and potential new bank and credit facilities 

our cash flows used for capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below 

 financing activities 

during 2005 2004 and 2003 liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from operations bank credit facilities and trade credit substantially all of our store locations buying offices our headquarters and certain distribution centers are leased and except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment do not represent longterm capital investments we own a distribution center in carlisle pennsylvania and our warehouse in moreno valley california 

we repurchased 64 million 65 million and 69 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 175 million 175 million and 150 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively under the stock repurchase programs funded by cash flows from operations 

shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for investments in merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade bank and credit lines to meet our capital and liquidity requirements including debt maturities and lease obligations in 2006 

the table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of january 28 2006 

 term debt   we have a 50 million senior unsecured term loan to finance the equipment and information systems for our perris california distribution center in march 2006 we paid the 50 million term debt balance in full we incurred interest expense on term debt of 05 million in fiscal 2006 which was calculated based upon prevailing interest rates libor plus 175 basis points and is included in “term debt” in the table above interest was payable no less than monthly at the bank’s applicable prime rate or at libor plus an applicable margin 175 basis points which resulted in an effective interest rate of 63 at january 28 2006 borrowings under this term loan were subject to certain operating and financial covenants including maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios as of january 28 2006 we were in compliance with these covenants 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

operating leases   substantially all of our store sites certain distribution centers and our buying offices and corporate headquarters are leased and except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment do not represent longterm capital investments we own our distribution center in carlisle pennsylvania and our warehouse in moreno valley california 

we have lease arrangements for certain equipment in our stores for our pos hardware and software systems these leases are accounted for as operating leases for financial reporting purposes the initial terms of these leases are two years and we typically have options to renew the leases for two to three oneyear periods alternatively we may purchase or return the equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term we have guaranteed the value of the equipment at the end of the respective initial lease terms of 126 million which is included in “other synthetic lease obligations” in the table above 

in january 2004 we commenced the lease on our corporate headquarters in pleasanton california the lease has an initial term of 105 years with three fiveyear renewal options 

in october 2004 we entered into a lease arrangement to use a portion of the newark facility to support distribution activities for dd’s discounts for an initial lease term of two years with three oneyear renewal options a minor part of its remaining useful life 

other financings   we lease a 13 million square foot distribution center in fort mill south carolina this distribution center including equipment and systems is being financed under an 873 million fiveyear synthetic lease facility that expires in may 2006 rent expense on this center is payable monthly at 90 basis points over libor on the lease balance of 873 million we have estimated rent expense on the lease which is calculated based upon prevailing interest rates libor plus 90 basis points which resulted in an effective interest rate of 55 at january 28 2006 and is included in “synthetic leases” in the contractual obligations table above at the end of the lease term 

the company must refinance the 873 million synthetic lease facility purchase the distribution center at the amount of the thenoutstanding lease balance or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to 85 of the lease balance our obligation under this residual value guarantee of 742 million is included in “other synthetic lease obligations” in the contractual obligations table above

in addition we lease two separate warehouse facilities for packaway storage in carlisle pennsylvania with operating leases expiring through 2011 in january 2004 we entered into a twoyear lease with two oneyear options for a warehouse facility in fort mill south carolina the first option of which has been exercised extending the term to february 1 2007 these three leased facilities are being used primarily to store packaway merchandise 

the synthetic lease facilities described above as well as our term debt and revolving credit facility have covenant restrictions requiring us to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios in addition the interest rates under these agreements may vary depending on our actual interest coverage ratios as of january 28 2006 we were in compliance with these covenants 

in december 2003 the fasb issued the revised fin no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities” which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards fin no 46r explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity we were not required under fin no 46r to consolidate our synthetic leases since the lessorsowners are not variable interest entities 

purchase obligations as of january 28 2006 we had purchase obligations of 6599 million these purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders commitments related to store fixtures and supplies and information technology service and maintenance contracts merchandise inventory purchase orders of 6145 million represent purchase obligations of less than one year as of january 28 2006

we estimate that cash flows from operations bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating cash needs fund our planned capital investments repay our term loan address the amount due in connection with our fort mill south carolina distribution center repurchase common stock and make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory   our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method we purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as “packaway” inventory packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shrinkage the shrinkage reserve is based on historical shrinkage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions markdowns or shrinkage are less favorable than those projected by us or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets   we record a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group if our actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future during 2004 we recognized an impairment charge of 158 million before taxes to writedown the carrying value and account for the sale of our newark facility in the course of performing our annual analysis we determined that no other longlived asset impairment charge was required for the years ended january 28 2006 january 29 2005 and january 31 2004 

depreciation and amortization expense   property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real property the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term whichever is less 

lease accounting   we currently capitalize rent during a construction buildout period and amortize it over the lease term commencing when the leased premises are substantially ready for their intended use we will adopt fasb staff position “fsp” 131 “accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period” which requires that rental costs incurred during a construction period be expensed not capitalized beginning in 2006 when a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments we record rental expense on a straightline basis and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent we amortize deferred rent on a straightline basis over the lease term commencing on the date the leased space is ready for its intended use tenant improvement allowances are included in other longterm liabilities and are amortized over the lease term changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

selfinsurance   we self insure certain of our workers’ compensation and general liability risks as well as certain of our health plans our selfinsurance liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

the list above is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

new accounting pronouncements 

in november 2004 the fasb issued the revised sfas no 151 “inventory costs” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage sfas no 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 151 will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 

in december 2004 the fasb issued the revised sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services sfas no 123r requires recognition of stockbased compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award sfas no 123r is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we will implement the requirements of the standard as of the beginning of our fiscal year 2006 

we will use the modified prospective approach for adoption of sfas no 123r under this approach prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes the valuation provisions of sfas no 123r will apply to new awards granted in our fiscal year 2006 and later and to awards that are outstanding from prior fiscal years if they are subsequently modified or canceled these awards will be valued using the blackscholes option pricing model consistent with our prior pro forma disclosures under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” compensation expense for awards outstanding at the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for the previously reported pro forma disclosure purposes for awards granted after the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year we will recognize expense on a straightline basis over the applicable vesting term we do not believe that the impact from adopting this standard will be materially different from what has been reported in our prior pro forma disclosures and expect the effect to represent compensation costs equivalent to about 06 per share for fiscal 2006 see the discussion under “stockbased compensation” in note a to notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our pro forma equity compensation cost calculations for 2005 2004 and 2003 the stockbased compensation we will recognize after the adoption of sfas no 123r will be affected by the number of stockbased awards granted in the future and the assumptions used for estimating the fair values of options 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” which requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in an accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 154 which is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in october 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” 131 “accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period” to clarify the proper accounting for rental costs incurred on building or ground operating leases during a construction period the fsp requires that rental costs incurred during a construction period be expensed not capitalized the statement is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december 15 2005 we will adopt fsp 131 beginning in our fiscal year 2006 and do not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 

forwardlooking statements 

our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2005 and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders press releases telephonic reports and other investor communications including on our website may contain a number of forwardlooking statements regarding without limitation planned store growth new markets expected sales projected earnings levels capital expenditures and other matters these forwardlooking statements reflect our then current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance operations and competitive position the words “plan” “expect” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “forecast” “projected” “guidance” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements   

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue profitability and growth remain difficult to predict as a result our forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forwardlooking statements and our previous expectations and projections refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd’s discounts the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts or forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices we had no outstanding forward contracts at january 28 2006 

interest that is payable on our revolving credit facilities and term debt is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates in addition lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 28 2006 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and had 50 million of term debt outstanding which accrues interest at libor plus 175 basis points in addition the lease on our distribution center in fort mill south carolina accrues interest at libor plus 90 basis points 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as of and for the year ended january 28 2006 we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc the “company” operates two chains of offprice retail apparel and home accessories stores which target valueconscious men and women between the ages of 25 and 54 primarily in middle income households the decisions of the company from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the location of its stores are aimed at this customer base the company offers brandname and designer merchandise at low everyday prices generally 20 to 60 below regular prices of most department and specialty stores the company believes it derives a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of quality brandname merchandise within each of its merchandise categories in an organized and easytoshop environment 

the company’s mission is to offer competitive values to its target customer by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

 the original ross stores inc was incorporated in california in 1957 in august 1982 the company was purchased by some of its then and current directors and stockholders the original six stores acquired were completely refurbished in the company’s offprice format and stocked with new merchandise in june 1989 the company reincorporated in the state of delaware during 2004 the company opened its first ten dd’s discounts sm stores a new offprice concept targeted to serve the needs of lower income households 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

the company seeks to provide its customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brandname apparel accessories and footwear for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 below regular department and specialty store prices as well as similar savings on fragrances items for the home bed and bath merchandise and related accessories the company sells recognizable branded merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to five times per week at the company’s stores the company’s buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market the company’s merchandising strategy is reflected in its advertising which emphasizes a strong value message  the company’s customers will find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brandname merchandise 

merchandising   the company’s merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise management believes nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of its success the company generally leaves the brandname label on the merchandise it sells 

the company has established a merchandise assortment that it believes is attractive to its target customer although the company offers fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores the company generally offers a large selection of brand names within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item over the past several years the company has diversified its merchandise offerings by adding new product categories such as maternity small furniture or furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware sporting goods and in select stores fine jewelry total comparable store sales by department in fiscal 2004 were approximately as follows ladies 34 home accents and bed and bath 21 men’s 16 fine jewelry accessories lingerie and fragrances 12 children’s 9 and shoes 8 

purchasing   the company has a network of approximately 4000 vendors and manufacturers and believes it has adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet its requirements the company purchases the vast majority of its merchandise directly from manufacturers and has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory 

the company believes that its ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in its success the company’s buyers use a number of methods that enable the company to offer its customers brandname merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department and specialty stores the company is able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores the company does not typically require that manufacturers provide promotional and markdown allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of the company’s four distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable the company’s buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the vast majority of the merchandise that the company offers in its stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as “closeout” and “packaway” purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing the company to get inseason goods in its stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the company’s warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within the merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in 2004 the company continued its emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 43 of total inventories as of january 29 2005 remaining flat compared to the prior year it is management’s belief that the strong discounts the company is able to offer on packaway merchandise are a key driver of the company’s business 

the company utilizes analytical processes for regionalized merchandise buying and allocation the goal is to finetune the merchandise mix and raise gross profit margins and sales productivity especially in markets that are performing below the company average these analytical processes also provide the company with the tools to help maximize new store productivity in new markets all merchandise departments are utilizing these analytical processes with the exception of fine jewelry which is planned on a store specific basis 

the company’s buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nation’s two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow the company’s buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable the company’s buyers to strengthen vendor relationships  a key element in the success of its offprice buying strategies 

the company’s buyers have an average of over 14 years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdale’s burlington coat factory dayton hudson foot locker kohl’s lechters lord  taylor macy’s marshalls nordstrom robinsonsmay sterns tj maxx and value city in keeping with its strategy since 1992 the company’s merchandising staff has grown over fourfold management believes that this increase enables its merchants to spend even more time in the market which in turn should strengthen the company’s ability to procure the most desirable brands at competitive discounts 

these offprice buying strategies enable the company to purchase merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores 

pricing   the company’s policy is to sell brandname merchandise priced 20 to 60 less than most department and specialty store regular prices the company’s pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying the company’s selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department andor specialty stores 

the company’s pricing strategy differs from that of a department or specialty store the company purchases its merchandise at lower prices and marks it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables the company to offer customers consistently low prices specified departments in the store are reviewed weekly for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale and the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and accelerate the flow of fresh merchandise 

stores 

as of january 29 2005 the company operated 649 stores of which 639 are ross dress for less stores and ten are dd’s discounts sm stores they are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood strip shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market permits the company clusters stores to maximize economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management 

the company believes a key element of its success is its organized attractive easytoshop instore environment which allows customers to shop at their own pace the company’s stores are designed for customer convenience in their merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas the store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department the company encourages its customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers promoting a selfservice atmosphere at most stores shopping carts baskets andor shopping bags are available at the entrance for customer convenience all cash registers are centrally located at store entrances for customer ease and efficient staffing 

the company uses pointofsale “pos” hardware and software systems in all stores which minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by using electronic systems for scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing credit for personal checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds in addition the pos systems allow the company to accept pinbased debit cards and sell electronic gift cards to customers the company provides cash or credit card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30 days approximately 52 of payments in 2004 and 48 of payments in 2003 were made with credit cards and debit cards merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or credited with a credit voucher at the price on the receipt 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of its business strategy the company strives to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled the company to operate at low costs are 

 distribution 

the company has a sourcebased distribution network with a total of four distribution processing facilities strategically located close to the source of inbound merchandise receipts there are two 13 million square foot distribution centers that the company leases in fort mill south carolina and perris california the company owns a third 426000 square foot distribution center located in carlisle pennsylvania 

the company sold its 530000 square foot newark distribution center “newark facility” in 2004 and entered into a lease arrangement to use approximately 154000 square feet of the newark facility to support distribution activities for dd’s discounts sm and the company’s data center see additional discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

in addition the company leases two warehouses for packaway storage totaling about 485000 square feet in carlisle pennsylvania and 253000 square feet in fort mill south carolina and utilizes other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory 

the company also utilizes thirdparty cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to five times per week depending on location the company is currently in negotiations to acquire additional distribution center space during 2005 the company believes that its existing distribution centers will provide adequate processing capacity to support store growth at least into 2006 

information systems 

during 2004 the company continued to invest in new systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years recent initiatives include the following 

 5 

advertising 

the company relies primarily on television advertising to communicate its value proposition  brandname merchandise at low everyday prices this strategy reflects the company’s belief that television is the most efficient and costeffective medium for communicating everyday savings on a wide selection of brandname bargains for both the family and home 

trademarks 

the trademark for ross dress for less® has been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

on january 29 2005 the company had approximately 30100 employees which includes an estimated 17700 parttime employees additionally the company hires temporary employees  especially during the peak seasons the company’s employees are nonunion management of the company considers the relationship between the company and its employees to be good 

competition 

the company believes the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home accessories industry are offering significant discounts on brandname merchandise and a wellbalanced assortment appealing to its target customer and consistently providing a store environment that is convenient and easytoshop to execute this concept the company has strengthened its buying organization and developed a merchandise allocation system to distribute product based on regional factors as well as other systems and procedures to maximize cost efficiencies and leverage expenses in an effort to mitigate competitive pressures on gross margin the company believes that it is well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

nevertheless the national retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive the company faces intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than the company the company also competes to some degree with any retailer that sells apparel and home accessories through catalogs or over the internet the retail apparel business may become even more competitive in the future 

dd’s discounts sm

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend restatement of consolidated financial statements 

on february 7 2005 the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their treatment under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” in response to this letter the company initiated a review of its lease related accounting and determined that the company’s method of accounting for landlord incentives or allowances under operating leases tenant improvement allowances and the company’s method of accounting for “rent holidays” were not consistent with this guidance 

the company historically accounted for tenant improvement allowances as reductions of fixed assets on the consolidated balance sheets and as reductions of capital expenditures in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows the company historically amortized leasehold improvements over the original lease term typically 10 years the company determined that the appropriate interpretation of financial accounting standards board “fasb” technical bulletin no 88–1 “issues relating to accounting for leases” requires these allowances to be recorded as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets amortized over the lease term and included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

the company historically amortized rent holiday periods on a straight–line basis over the lease term based on the store opening date which excluded the buildout period for its stores from the term over which it expensed rent the company considered fasb technical bulletin no 85–3 “accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases” and determined that the lease term should commence on the date the company takes possession of the leased space for construction purposes which is generally one to four months prior to the opening date 

in addition the company historically capitalized rent during the construction period for its distribution and headquarter facilities the company considered interpretive guidance based on analogies to fasb statement no 34 “capitalization of interest cost” and fasb statement no 67 “accounting for the costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” regarding capitalization of rent during the period of time a lessee is performing construction activities the company concluded that its historical policy of capitalizing rent during the buildout period is appropriate and has corrected its accounting to apply the policy to the buildout period for all facilities including its stores 

as a result the company restated the consolidated financial statements for its fiscal years 2003 and 2002 

the corrections are summarized in note b to the consolidated financial statements included in this report at part ii item 8 the accompanying management’s discussion and analysis gives effect to these restatement adjustments 

overview 

the company is the second largest offprice apparel retail company in the united states with 639 ross stores and ten dd’s discounts sm store locations in 26 states and guam at the end of fiscal 2004 the company’s primary strategy has been a continued focus on pursuing and refining its existing offprice business and steadily expanding the number of stores and its geographic markets in establishing growth objectives for the business the company closely monitors market share trends for the offprice industry according to data from the npd group which provides global sales and marketing information on the retail industry the offprice share of total apparel sales in 2004 grew to 85 from 76 in 2003 reflecting the ongoing importance of value to consumers fullpriced department stores and mass merchandise retailers experienced a decline in apparel market share over the same period the company’s strategies are designed to take advantage of these growth trends and continued customer demand for namebrand fashions for the family and the home at competitive everyday discounts 

in 2004 the company opened its first ten dd’s discounts sm stores a new offprice concept targeting what it believes to be an underserved but fastgrowing demographic  lower income households the company believes that ultimately the united states can support a total of 1500 ross locations and over 500 dd’s discounts sm   stores – for an aggregate potential of over 2000 locations 

the fiscal years ended january 29 2005 january 31 2004 and february 1 2003 are referred to as 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

results of operations 

 stores total stores open at the end of 2004 2003 and 2002 were 649 568 and 507 respectively the number of stores at the end of 2004 2003 and 2002 increased by 14 12 and 12 from the prior fiscal year respectively the increased rate of growth in 2004 compared to prior years reflected the company’s launch of its new concept dd’s discounts sm with ten initial stores the company’s operating strategy is to open additional stores in new and existing geographic markets based on market penetration the ability to reduce overhead expenses local demographic characteristics competition and population density management continually evaluates opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations the company also evaluates its current store locations and determines store closures based on similar criteria 

 sales sales increased 3194 million or 8 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 81 net new stores during 2004 and the impact of the stores opened in 2003 partially offset by a 1 decrease in sales from “comparable” stores defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months sales increased 3892 million or 11 for 2003 compared to the same period in the prior year due to a 1 increase in sales from comparable stores the opening of 61 net new stores in 2003 and the full year impact of stores opened in 2002 sales increased 5448 million or 18 for 2002 compared to the prior year due to a 7 increase in sales from comparable stores the opening of 55 net new stores in 2002 and the full year impact of 2001 store openings 

the company’s sales mix is shown below for 2004 2003 and 2002 

 management expects to address the competitive climate for apparel and home goods offprice retailers by pursuing and refining the company’s existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen its organization to diversify the merchandise mix and to more fully develop the organization and systems to strengthen regional merchandise offerings although the company’s existing strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in 2004 2003 and 2002 there can be no assurance that these strategies will result in a continuation of revenue growth or profit growth 

during april 2004 the company installed a new core merchandising system which is a computerbased information system that over time is expected to improve the company’s ability to plan buy and allocate merchandise more precisely subsequent to the installation of the new merchandising system the company experienced difficulties in generating the necessary merchandising related information utilized by its merchants and allocators although the company is unable to quantify the impact it believes the core merchandising system problems had an adverse effect on 2004 sales and earnings the company believes that these merchant reporting issues were essentially remedied by the end of fiscal year 2004 

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in 2004 increased 3611 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 81 net new stores during the year the impact of the stores opened in 2003 higher markdowns and increased distribution and logistics costs 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for the year increased approximately 290 basis points compared with the same period in the prior year this increase is largely attributable to higher distribution and logistics costs lower merchandise gross margin largely due to higher markdowns and reduced leverage resulting from the 1 decrease in comparable store sales which contributed to higher occupancy and buying expenses as a percentage of sales and buying costs related to the launch of dd’s discounts sm  distribution and logistics costs as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 130 basis points due mainly to lower productivity and higher payroll expenses associated with new distribution center systems and higher offsite storage costs higher markdowns and lower initial markups contributed to an approximate 100 basis point increase in merchandise cost of goods sold in addition store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 35 basis points buying costs as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 25 basis points compared to the prior year 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales remained flat at 745 for both 2003 and 2002 as a percentage of sales merchandise margin in 2003 remained flat compared to 2002 distribution and logistics costs decreased by approximately 25 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an approximate 15 basis point reduction in distribution costs and a 10 basis point reduction in freight costs this decrease in distribution costs as a percentage of sales in 2003 was offset by a 25 basis point increase in store occupancy and buying related costs in 2003 compared to 2002 largely attributable to reduced leverage resulting from the slower rate of comparable store sales growth over the same period in the prior year buying costs as a percentage of sales remained flat compared to 2002 

there can be no assurance that the gross profit margins realized in 2004 2003 and 2002 will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2004 selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 360 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 81 net new stores during the period partially offset by lower incentive plan costs 

sga as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 35 basis points primarily due to an approximate 55 basis point decrease in incentive plan costs partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in store payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales 

total sga were 6284 million in 2003 a 560 million increase from 2002 during 2003 sga as a percentage of sales declined approximately 20 basis points this decrease was primarily due to a 30 basis point decrease in benefitrelated costs which were partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in depreciation costs store operating costs as a percentage of sales remained flat in 2003 compared to 2002 

the largest component of sga is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime at january 29 2005 january 31 2004 and february 1 2003 was approximately 30100 26600 and 22500 respectively 

interest interest expense in 2004 increased 16 million and interest income increased 04 million compared to the prior year as a percentage of sales interest expense and interest income in 2004 remained relatively flat compared to the prior year the table below reflects interest income and expense for 2004 2003 and 2002 

 impairment of longlived assets   during the second quarter of 2004 the company relocated its corporate headquarters from newark california to pleasanton california and decided to pursue a sale of its newark facility the company recognized an impairment charge of 18 million before taxes in the second quarter 2004 to writedown the carrying value of its newark facility from its net book value of approximately 33 million to the estimated fair value at the time of approximately 15 million during the third quarter the company sold the newark facility for net proceeds of approximately 17 million the company recognized a gain reduction in impairment loss of approximately 2 million before taxes in the third quarter 2004 on the sale of its newark facility for the year ended january 29 2005 the net impairment charge recognized by the company was approximately 16 million before taxes 

taxes on earnings the company’s effective tax rate for 2004 2003 and 2002 was approximately 39 which represents the applicable federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit received for state taxes the effective rate is impacted by changes in law location of new stores level of earnings and the result of tax audits 

net earnings the decrease in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales partially offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales the increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales diluted earnings per share in 2004 was 113 inclusive of the 06 write down related to the company’s former corporate office and distribution center and 01 related to the lease accounting adjustments compared to 147 in 2003 this decrease is attributable to an approximate 25 decrease in net earnings partially offset by a 3 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management of the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable the company believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory the company’s merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method the company purchases manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as “packaway” inventory packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the company’s warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year included in the carrying value of the company’s merchandise inventory is a provision for shrinkage the shrinkage reserve is based on historical shrinkage rates as evaluated through the company’s physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional merchandise inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets   the company records a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group should actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future during 2004 the company recognized an impairment charge of 158 million before taxes to writedown the carrying value and account for the sale of its newark facility in the course of performing this analysis management determined that no other longlived asset impairment charge was required for years ended january 29 2005 january 31 2004 and february 1 2003 

selfinsurance the company self insures certain of its workers’ compensation and general liability risks as well as certain of its health insurance plans the company’s selfinsurance liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company’s accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result see the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

new accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued the revised statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services sfas no 123r requires recognition of stockbased compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award sfas no 123r is effective for periods beginning after june 15 2005 the company will implement the requirements of the standard as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2005 the impact of adopting sfas no 123r will be dependent on numerous factors including but not limited to the valuation model chosen by the company to value stockbased awards the assumed award forfeiture rate the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period and the transition method chosen for adopting sfas no 123r the company has not yet quantified the effects of the adoption of sfas no 123r 

in november 2004 the fasb issued the revised sfas no 151 “inventory costs” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage sfas no 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 151 will have a material impact on the company’s operating results or financial position 

dd’s discounts sm 

during 2004 the company opened ten initial dd’s discounts sm stores a new offprice concept targeted to serve the needs of lowerincome households which it believes to be one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country the company opened these initial stores at locations in california during the second half of 2004 this new business generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of ross but features a different mix of brands consisting mostly of moderate department store and discount store labels at lower average price points the average dd’s discounts sm store is approximately 26000 gross square feet and is located in an established strip shopping center in densely populated urban and suburban neighborhoods the dd’s discounts sm and ross merchant store and distribution organizations are separate and distinct however dd’s discounts sm shares other certain corporate and support services with ross 

forwardlooking statements and risk factors affecting future performance 

this report includes certain forwardlooking statements regarding planned new store growth and expected sales and earnings levels which reflect the company’s current beliefs projections and estimates with respect to future events and the company’s future financial performance operations and competitive position the words “expect” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “looking ahead” “forecast” “guidance” “plan” “projected” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

risks and uncertainties that apply to both ross and dd’s discounts sm stores include without limitation the company’s ability to effectively operate and integrate various new supply chain and core merchandising systems including generation of all necessary information in a timely and cost effective manner migrating the company’s data center from newark california to pleasanton california in the first half of 2005 without unexpected delays or interruption in system availability achieving and maintaining targeted levels of productivity and efficiency in its distribution centers obtaining acceptable new store locations competitive pressures in the apparel industry changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel or homerelated merchandise changes in geopolitical and general economic conditions unseasonable weather trends disruptions in supply chain lower than planned gross margin and greater than planned 

operating costs the company’s ability to continue to purchase attractive brandname merchandise at desirable discounts the company’s ability to identify and successfully enter new geographic markets and the company’s ability to attract and retain personnel with the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies 

the company’s corporate headquarters certain of its distribution centers and 30 of its stores are located in california therefore a downturn in the california economy or a major california natural disaster could significantly affect the company’s operating results and financial condition 

the company’s continued success depends in part upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations and to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis there can be no assurance that the company’s existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue growth or profit growth 

future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict the factors underlying the company’s forecasts are dynamic and subject to change as a result any forecasts speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect the company’s outlook at any other point in time the company disclaims any obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates the company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

interest that is payable on the company’s revolving credit facilities and longterm debt is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates in addition lease payments under certain of the company’s synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 29 2005 the company had no borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and had 50 million of longterm debt outstanding which accrues interest at libor plus 150 basis points 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as of and for the year ended january 29 2005 the company does not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material 

the company uses forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices the company had no outstanding forward contracts at january 29 2005

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc “ross” or “the company” operates a chain of offprice retail apparel and home accessories stores which target valueconscious men and women between the ages of 25 and 54 primarily in middleincome households the decisions of the company from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the location of its stores are aimed at this customer base the company offers brandname and designer merchandise at low everyday prices generally 20 to 60 below regular prices of most department and specialty stores the company believes it derives a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of quality brandname merchandise within each of its merchandise categories in an attractive and easytoshop environment 

ross’ mission is to offer competitive values to its target customer by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

 the original ross stores inc was incorporated in california in 1957 in august 1982 the company was purchased by some of its then and current directors and stockholders the six stores acquired were completely refurbished in the company’s offprice format and stocked with new merchandise in june 1989 the company reincorporated in the state of delaware 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

ross seeks to provide its customers with a wide assortment of firstquality inseason brandname apparel accessories and footwear for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 from regular department and specialty store prices as well as similar savings on fragrances items for the home bed and bath merchandise and accessories the company sells recognizable branded merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to five times per week at the company’s stores the company’s buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market the company’s merchandising strategy is reflected in its advertising which emphasizes a strong value message  ross’ customers will find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brandname merchandise 

merchandising   the ross merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase advanceofseason inseason and pastseason merchandise management believes nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of its success ross generally leaves the brandname label on the merchandise it sells 

the company has established a merchandise assortment that it believes is attractive to its target customer although ross offers fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores the company generally offers a large selection of brand names within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item over the past several years the company has diversified its merchandise offerings by adding new product categories such as maternity small furniture or furniture accents educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware sporting goods and in select stores fine jewelry total sales by department in fiscal 2003 were approximately as follows ladies 33 home accents and bed and bath 21 men’s 17 fine jewelry accessories lingerie and fragrances 12 children’s 9 and shoes 8 

purchasing   the company continues to expand its network of approximately 4000 vendors and manufacturers and believes it has adequate sources of firstquality merchandise to meet its requirements 

the company purchases the vast majority of its merchandise directly from manufacturers and has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient inventory 

the company believes that its ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in its success ross buyers use a number of methods that enable the company to offer its customers brandname merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department and specialty stores ross is able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores ross does not typically require that manufacturers provide promotional and markdown allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of the company’s three distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable the company’s buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the vast majority of the merchandise that the company offers in its stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as “closeout” and “packaway” purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores inseason allowing the company to get inseason goods in its stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the company’s warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within the merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

in 2003 the company continued its emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 43 of total inventories as of january 31 2004 compared to 44 at the end of the prior year it is management’s belief that the strong discounts the company is able to offer on packaway merchandise are a key driver of ross’ business 

the company utilizes analytical processes for regionalized merchandise buying and allocation the goal is to finetune the merchandise mix and raise gross profit margins and sales productivity especially in markets that are performing below the company average these analytical processes also provide the company with the tools to help maximize new store productivity in new markets all merchandise departments are utilizing these analytical processes with the exception of fine jewelry which is planned on a store specific basis 

ross’ buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nation’s two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow the company’s buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable the company’s buyers to strengthen vendor relationships  a key element in the success of its offprice buying strategies 

the company’s buyers have an average of over 14 years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdale’s burlington coat factory dayton hudson foot locker kohl’s lechters lord  taylor macy’s marshalls nordstrom robinsonsmay sterns tj maxx and value city in keeping with its strategy since 1992 the company’s merchandising staff has grown over fourfold management believes that this increase enables its merchants to spend even more time in the market which in turn should strengthen the company’s ability to procure the most desirable brands at competitive discounts 

these offprice buying strategies enable the company to purchase merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores 

pricing   the company’s policy is to sell brandname merchandise priced 20 to 60 less than most department and specialty store regular prices the ross pricing policy is reflected on the price tag 

displaying the company’s selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department andor specialty stores 

the ross pricing strategy differs from that of a department or specialty store ross purchases its merchandise at lower prices and marks it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables ross to offer customers consistently low prices specified departments in the store are reviewed weekly for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale and the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of inventory and accelerate the flow of fresh merchandise 

the ross store 

as of january 31 2004 the company operated 568 stores they are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood strip shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market permits the company clusters stores to maximize economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management 

the company believes a key element of its success is its organized attractive easytoshop instore environment which allows customers to shop at their own pace the ross store is designed for customer convenience in its merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas the ross store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department ross encourages its customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers promoting a selfservice atmosphere at most stores shopping carts baskets andor shopping bags are available at the entrance for customer convenience all cash registers are centrally located at store entrances for customer ease and efficient staffing 

during 2003 the company installed new pointofsale “pos” hardware and software systems in all stores this new technology minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by using electronic systems for scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing credit for personal checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds in addition the new pos systems allow the company to accept pinbased debit cards and sell electronic gift cards to customers ross provides cash or credit card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30 days approximately 48 of payments in 2003 and 46 of payments in 2002 were made with credit cards and debit cards merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or credited with a ross credit voucher at the price on the receipt 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of its business strategy ross strives to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled the company to operate at low costs are 

 distribution 

the company has a sourcebased distribution network with a total of three distribution processing facilities strategically located close to the source of inbound merchandise receipts there are two 13 million square foot distribution centers that the company leases in fort mill south carolina and perris california the company owns a third 426000 square foot distribution center located in carlisle pennsylvania in addition the company leases two warehouses totaling about 485000 square feet in carlisle pennsylvania and 253000 square feet in fort mill south carolina and utilizes other thirdparty facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory 

in the second half of 2003 the company transitioned production from its 19yearold newark california distribution center to the new perris facility which opened in september perris is now the company’s primary west coast distribution center the company is in the process of looking at alternative uses for the newark facility and is obtaining independent thirdparty market valuations of that facility see additional discussion in management’s discussion and analysis 

the company also utilizes thirdparty cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to five times per week depending on location the company believes that its three distribution centers can provide adequate processing capacity to support store growth at least through 2006 

information systems 

during 2003 the company continued to invest in new systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years initiatives in 2003 and 2004 include the following 

 advertising 

the company relies primarily on television advertising to communicate its value proposition  brandname merchandise at low everyday prices this strategy reflects the company’s belief that television is the most efficient and costeffective medium for communicating everyday savings on a wide selection of brandname bargains for both the family and home 

trademarks 

the trademark for ross dress for less® has been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

on january 31 2004 the company had approximately 26600 employees which includes an estimated 16700 parttime employees additionally the company hires temporary employees  especially during the peak seasons the company’s employees are nonunion management of the company considers the relationship between the company and its employees to be good 

competition 

the company believes the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home accessories industry are offering large discounts on brandname merchandise and a wellbalanced assortment appealing to its target customer and consistently providing a store environment that is convenient and easytoshop to execute this concept the company has strengthened its buying organization and developed a merchandise allocation system to distribute product based on regional factors as well as other systems and procedures to maximize cost efficiencies and leverage expenses in an effort to mitigate competitive pressures on gross margin the company believes that it is well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

nevertheless the national retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive ross faces intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than ross the company also competes to some degree with any retailer that sells apparel and home accessories through catalogs or over the internet the retail apparel business may become even more competitive in the future 

dd’s discounts sm 

during 2003 the company announced the development of dd’s discounts sm  a new offprice concept targeted to serve the needs of lower income households one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country this new business will generally have similar merchandise departments and categories to those of ross but will feature a different mix of brands consisting of mostly moderate and discount store labels at lower average price points the company plans to open ten initial dd’s discounts sm locations on the west coast during the second half of 2004 see additional discussion concerning dd’s discounts sm in management’s discussion and analysis

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview 

the company is the second largest offprice apparel retail company in the united states with 568 stores in 25 states and guam at the end of fiscal 2003 the company’s primary strategy has been a continued focus on pursuing and refining its existing offprice business and steadily expanding the number of stores and its geographic markets in establishing growth objectives for the business the company closely monitors market share trends for the offprice industry according to data from the npd group which provides global sales and marketing information on the retail industry the offprice share of total apparel sales in 2003 grew to 78 from 74 in 2002 reflecting the ongoing importance of value to consumers fullpriced department stores and mass merchandise retailers experienced a decline in apparel market share over the same period the company’s strategies are designed to take advantage of these growth trends and continued customer demand for namebrand fashions for the family and the home at competitive everyday discounts 

in addition the company recently introduced a new offprice concept dd’s discounts sm  to target what it believes to be an underserved but fastgrowing demographic  lower income households the company believes that ultimately the united states can support a total of 1500 ross locations and over 500 dd’s discounts sm   stores – for an aggregate potential of over 2000 locations considering the significant expansion opportunities that remain in both existing and new markets the company plans to grow to over 1000 stores by the end of fiscal 2008 and generate more than 7 billion annually in revenue by fiscal 2008 

the fiscal years ended january 31 2004 february 1 2003 and february 2 2002 are referred to as 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

results of operations 

 stores   total stores open at the end of 2003 2002 and 2001 were 568 507 and 452 respectively the number of stores at the end of 2003 2002 and 2001 increased by 12 12 and 11 respectively the increased rate of growth in 2003 and 2002 compared to prior years reflected the company’s entry into new markets the company’s operating strategy is to open additional stores in new and existing geographic markets based on market penetration the ability to reduce overhead expenses local demographic characteristics competition and population density management continually evaluates opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations the company also evaluates its current store locations and determines store closures based on similar criteria 

 sales   the 11 total sales increase for 2003 reflects a 1 increase in sales from “comparable” stores stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months the opening of 61 net new stores in 2003 and the full year impact of stores opened in 2002 the 18 total sales increase for 2002 reflects a 7 increase in sales from comparable stores the opening of 55 net new stores in 2002 and the full year impact of stores opened in 2001 the 10 total sales increase for 2001 reflects a 3 increase in sales from comparable stores the opening of 43 net new stores in 2001 and the full year impact of 2000 store openings 

the company’s sales mix as shown below reflects the growth in its home businesses which was a key contributor to comparable store sales growth in 2003 2002 and 2001 

 management expects to address the competitive climate for apparel and home goods offprice retailers by pursuing and refining the company’s existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen its organization to diversify the merchandise mix and to more fully develop the organization and systems to strengthen regional merchandise offerings although the company’s existing strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales and earnings gains in 2003 2002 and 2001 there can be no assurance that these strategies will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth 

cost of goods sold   cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales remained flat at 744 for both 2003 and 2002 as a percentage of sales merchandise margin in 2003 remained flat compared to 2002 distribution and logistics costs decreased by approximately 25 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an approximate 15 basis point reduction in distribution costs and a 10 basis point reduction in freight costs this decrease in distribution costs as a percentage of sales in 2003 was offset by a 25 basis point increase in store occupancy costs in 2003 compared to 2002 largely attributable to reduced leverage resulting from the slower rate of comparable store sales growth over the same period in the prior year buying costs as a percentage of sales remained flat compared to 2002 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased from 751 in 2001 to 744 in 2002 which is largely attributable to improved leverage resulting from a 7 comparable store sales increase and distribution processing efficiencies as a percentage of sales merchandise margin in 2002 increased by approximately 25 basis points compared to 2001 store occupancy and depreciation as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 25 basis points distribution and logistics costs as a percentage of sales in 2002 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year due to a 20 basis point reduction in distribution costs partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in freight costs buying costs in 2002 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to 2001 primarily due to improved leverage resulting from the 7 comparable store sales increase 

there can be no assurance that the gross profit margins realized in 2003 2002 and 2001 will continue in future years 

selling general and administrative expenses   total selling general and administrative expenses “sga” were 6284 million in 2003 a 561 million increase from 2002 during 2003 sga as a percentage of sales declined approximately 20 basis points this decrease was primarily due to a 30 basis point decrease in benefitrelated costs which were partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in depreciation costs store operating costs as a percentage of sales remained flat in 2003 compared to 2002 

total sga was 5723 million in 2002 an 869 million increase from 2001 during 2002 sga as a percentage of sales decreased slightly due primarily to higher leverage on store payroll benefit costs and operating costs partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation costs store operating costs as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 20 basis points from 2001 due primarily to improved leverage resulting from a 7 comparable store sales increase general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales grew by approximately 15 basis points in 2002 due mainly to an increase in incentive compensation costs partially offset by improved leverage 

the largest component of sga is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime at january 31 2004 february 1 2003 and february 2 2002 was approximately 26600 22500 and 21000 respectively 

interest   interest expense and interest income as a percentage of sales in 2003 was relatively flat compared to the prior year the table below reflects interest income and expense for 2003 2002 and 2001 

 taxes on earnings   the company’s effective tax rate for 2003 2002 and 2001 was approximately 39 which represents the applicable federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit received for state taxes during 2004 the company expects its effective tax rate to remain at approximately 39 

net earnings   the increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales the increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to improved leverage realized from the increase in comparable store sales growth on store expenses and on buying distribution occupancy and depreciation costs in 2002 when compared to 2001 combined with slightly higher merchandise margins which was partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs diluted earnings per share in 2003 increased by 17 to 147 from 126 in 2002 this increase is attributable to an approximate 13 increase in net earnings and 3 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding

inventory   the company’s merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method the company purchases manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as “packaway” inventory packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the company’s warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year included in the carrying value of the company’s inventory is a provision for shrinkage the shrinkage reserve is based on historical shrinkage rates as evaluated through the company’s physical inventory counts and cycle counts if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if sales of the inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets   the company records a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group in the course of performing this analysis management determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for years ended january 31 2004 february 1 2003 and february 2 2002 should actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future 

selfinsurance   the company self insures certain of its workers’ compensation and general liability risks as well as certain of its health insurance plans the company’s selfinsurance liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company’s accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result see the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 

forwardlooking statements and factors affecting future performance 

this report includes certain forwardlooking statements which reflect the company’s current beliefs and estimates with respect to future events and the company’s future financial performance operations and competitive position the words “expect” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “looking ahead” “forecast” “plan” “projected” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

the company’s continued success depends in part upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis there can be no assurance that the company’s existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict 

the forwardlooking statements that are contained in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from historical results or current expectations these risk factors apply to both ross and dd’s discounts sm stores and include without limitation a general deterioration in economic trends changes in geopolitical conditions ongoing competitive pressures in the apparel industry the company’s ability to obtain acceptable store locations the company’s ability to continue to purchase attractive brandname merchandise at desirable discounts the company’s ability to operate its distribution network at targeted levels of productivity the company’s ability to successfully extend its geographic reach into new markets unseasonable weather trends changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences in apparel or homerelated merchandise the company’s ability to attract and retain personnel with the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies the company’s ability to implement and integrate various new systems and technologies and greater than planned costs in addition the company is evaluating whether it will incur a potential noncash nonrecurring charge to write down the value of the company’s newark headquarters and distribution center to current fair market value additionally the anticipated relaxation of trade restrictions with china in january 2005 may affect the company’s buying strategies and price points   in addition the company’s corporate headquarters certain of its distribution centers and 32 of its stores are located in california therefore a downturn in the california economy or a major california natural disaster could significantly affect the company’s operating results and financial condition 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risks which primarily include changes in interest rates the company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

interest that is payable on the company’s revolving credit facilities and longterm debt is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates in addition lease payments under certain of the company’s synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are therefore affected by changes in market interest rates as of january 31 2004 the company had no borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and had 50 million of longterm debt outstanding which accrues interest at libor plus 150 basis points 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as of and for the year ended january 31 2004 the company does not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio

 item 1 business 

ross stores inc “ross” or “the company” operates a chain of offprice retail apparel and home accessories stores which target value conscious men and women between the ages of 25 and 54 primarily in middleincome households the decisions of the company from merchandising purchasing and pricing to the location of its stores are aimed at this customer base the company offers brandname and designer merchandise at low everyday prices generally 20 to 60 below regular prices of most department and specialty stores the company believes it derives a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of quality brandname merchandise within each of its merchandise categories in an attractive easytoshop environment 

ross’ mission is to offer competitive values to its target customer by focusing on the following key strategic objectives 

achieve an appropriate level of recognizable brands and labels at strong discounts throughout the store meet customer needs on a more regional basis deliver an instore shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the offprice customer and manage real estate growth to increase market share in major markets the original ross stores inc was incorporated in california in 1957 in august 1982 the company was purchased by some of its then and current directors and stockholders the six stores acquired were completely refurbished in the companys offprice format and stocked with new merchandise in june 1989 the company reincorporated in the state of delaware 

merchandising purchasing and pricing 

ross seeks to provide its customers with a wide assortment of first quality inseason brandname apparel accessories and footwear for the entire family at everyday savings of 20 to 60 from regular department and specialty store prices as well as similar savings on fragrances items for the home bed and bath merchandise and accessories the company sells recognizable branded merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category new merchandise typically is received from three to five times each week at the company’s stores the company’s buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis enabling them to respond to merchandise trends and purchasing opportunities in the market the companys merchandising strategy is reflected in its advertising which emphasizes a strong value message—ross customers will find great savings everyday on a broad assortment of namebrand merchandise 

merchandising the ross merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of offprice buying techniques to purchase both inseason and pastseason merchandise the companys emphasis on nationally recognized name brands reflects managements conviction that brandname merchandise sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of its success ross generally leaves the brandname label on the merchandise it sells 

the company has established a merchandise assortment that it believes is attractive to its target customer group although ross offers fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores the company generally offers a large selection of brand names within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors labels prices colors styles and fabrics within each size or item over the past sever 

al years the company has diversified its merchandise offerings by adding new product categories such as maternity small furnishings educational toys and games luggage gourmet food and cookware and fine jewelry in select stores the respective departments accounted for total sales in fiscal 2002 approximately as follows ladies’ 34 home accents and bed and bath 19 mens 18 fine jewelry accessories lingerie and fragrances 12 children’s 9 and shoes 8 

purchasing the company continues to expand its network of over 4000 vendors and manufacturers and believes it has adequate sources of first quality merchandise to meet its requirements the company purchases the vast majority of its merchandise directly from manufacturers and has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient inventory 

the company believes that its ability to effectively execute certain offprice buying strategies is a key factor in its success ross buyers use a number of methods that enable the company to offer its customers brandname merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores by purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department and specialty stores ross is able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products 

unlike most department and specialty stores ross does not typically require that manufacturers provide promotional and markdown allowances return privileges split shipments drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise for most orders only one delivery is made to one of the companys three distribution centers these flexible requirements further enable the companys buyers to obtain significant discounts on inseason purchases 

the vast majority of the merchandise that the company offers in its stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season these buys are referred to as closeout and packaway purchases closeouts can be shipped to stores in season allowing the company to get in season goods in its stores at lower prices packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the companys warehouses until a later date which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within the merchandise assortments packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and therefore not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends 

throughout the past decade ross gradually increased the amount of packaway inventories in 2002 the company continued its emphasis on these important resources in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace packaway accounted for approximately 44 of total inventories as of february 1 2003 compared to 43 at the end of the prior year it is management’s belief that the strong discounts the company is able to offer on packaway merchandise are a key driver of ross’ business instore inventories at the end of fiscal 2002 were up about 1 from the prior year on a comparable store basis and total consolidated inventories were up about 15 mainly due to a greater number of stores in operation compared to the prior year 

during 2001 and 2000 the company implemented enhanced analytical processes for regionalized merchandise buying and allocation the goal is to fine tune the merchandise mix and raise gross profit margins and sales productivity especially in markets that are performing below the company average these analytical processes also provide the company with the tools to maximize new store productivity in new markets at the end of 2002 all merchandise departments were planned utilizing these analytical processes with the exception of fine jewelry which is planned on a store specific basis 

ross’ buying offices are located in new york city and los angeles the nations two largest apparel markets these strategic locations allow buyers to be in the market on a daily basis sourcing opportunities and 

negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers these locations also enable the companys buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key determinant in the success of its offprice buying strategies 

the companys buyers have an average of 15 years of experience including merchandising positions with other retailers such as bloomingdales burlington coat factory dayton hudson foot locker lechters lord  taylor macys marshalls nordstrom robinsonsmay sterns tj maxx and value city in keeping with its strategy over the past decade the company’s merchandising staff has grown almost fourfold management believes that this increase enables its merchants to spend even more time in the market which in turn should strengthen the companys ability to procure the most desirable brands at competitive discounts 

this combination of offprice buying strategies enables the company to purchase merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores 

pricing the companys policy is to sell brandname merchandise that can generally be priced at 20 to 60 less than most department and specialty store regular prices the ross pricing policy is to affix a ticket displaying the companys selling price as well as the estimated comparable selling price for that item in department andor specialty stores 

the ross pricing strategy differs from that of a department or specialty store ross purchases its merchandise at lower prices and marks it up less than a department or specialty store this strategy enables ross to offer customers consistently low prices specified departments in the store are reviewed weekly for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale and the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of inventory and accelerate the flow of fresh merchandise 

the ross store 

as of february 1 2003 the company operated 507 stores they are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood strip shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas where the size of the market permits the company clusters stores to maximize economies of scale in advertising distribution and field management 

the company believes a key element of its success is its organized attractive easytoshop instore environment which allows customers to shop at their own pace the ross store is designed for customer convenience in its merchandise presentation dressing rooms checkout and merchandise return areas the ross stores sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout a customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department ross encourages its customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers promoting a selfservice atmosphere at most stores shopping carts baskets andor shopping bags are available at the entrance for customer convenience all cash registers are centrally located at store entrances for customer ease and efficient staffing 

the company minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by using electronic systems for scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing credit for personal checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds approximately 46 of payments in 2002 were made with credit cards and debit cards ross provides cash or credit card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30 days merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or credited with a ross credit voucher at the price on the receipt 

operating costs 

consistent with the other aspects of its business strategy ross strives to keep operating costs as low as possible among the factors which have enabled the company to operate at low costs are 

labor costs that generally are lower than fullprice department and specialty stores due to i a store design that creates a selfselection retail format and ii the utilization of labor saving technologies economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs as a result of centralized merchandising marketing and purchasing decisions model store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to the ross format distribution 

the company has three distribution centers—one located in newark california which is also the company’s corporate headquarters the second located in carlisle pennsylvania and the third located in fort mill south carolina having distribution centers strategically located on each coast enhances cost efficiencies and decreases turnaround time in getting the merchandise from the vendors to the stores the company is constructing a new distribution center in perris california which is expected to be complete by the third quarter of 2003 this new facility will become the primary west coast distribution center see further discussion in management discussion and analysis the company utilizes third party cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to five times a week depending on location the company believes that its three distribution centers can provide adequate processing capacity to support store growth until its new distribution center located in perris california becomes operational during the third quarter of 2003 

the company also leases warehouse facilities primarily to store packaway purchases in newark and in carlisle 

control systems 

during 2002 the company continued to invest in new systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years initiatives in 2002 included the following 

implementation of a new financial system that features webenabled technology and intranet capability that has resulted in the automation of many manual processes implementation of a new warehouse management system in the new south carolina distribution center which will also be rolled out in the new southern california distribution center as well as the existing carlisle distribution center development began on a new core merchandising system which is expected to provide more indepth inventory and sales data this technology should enhance the company’s ability to plan buy and allocate merchandise more precisely eventually including by store by color and by size these new systems are targeted for completion during 2004 and over time are eventually expected to also support regional markdown capability implementation began on new pointofsale and sales audit systems to provide faster and more efficient transaction processing as well as extended multiple tender capabilities these systems are expected to be complete in 2004 advertising 

the company relies primarily on television advertising to communicate its value proposition brandname merchandise at low everyday prices this strategy reflects the companys belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating everyday savings on a wide selection of brandname bargains for both the family and home 

trademarks 

the trademark for ross dress for less ® has been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 

employees 

on february 1 2003 the company had approximately 22500 employees which includes an estimated 12200 parttime employees additionally the company hires temporary employees—especially during the peak seasons the companys employees are nonunion management of the company considers the relationship between the company and its employees to be good 

competition 

the company believes the principal competitive factors in the offprice retail apparel and home accessories industry are offering large discounts on brandname merchandise appealing to its target customer and consistently providing a store environment that is convenient and easy to shop to execute this concept the company has strengthened its buying organization and developed a merchandise allocation system to distribute product based on regional factors as well as other systems and procedures to maximize cost efficiencies and leverage expenses in an effort to mitigate competitive pressures on gross margin the company believes that it is well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors 

nevertheless the national apparel retail market is highly fragmented ross faces intense competition for business from department stores specialty stores discount stores other offprice retailers and manufacturerowned outlet stores many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than ross the company also competes to some degree with any retailer that sells apparel and home accessories through catalogues or over the internet the retail apparel business may become even more competitive in the future

during the fiscal year ended february 1 2003 no one store accounted for more than 1 of the companys sales the company carries earthquake insurance on its corporate headquarters distribution centers and all of its stores 

the companys real estate strategy is to open additional stores mainly in existing market areas to increase its market penetration and reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market important considerations in evaluating a new market are the availability of potential sites demographic characteristics competition and population density of the market in fiscal 2002 the company entered alabama a new state while also continuing to open stores in its existing markets in addition management continues to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions 

the following table summarizes the locations of the company’s stores by state as of february 1 2003 and february 2 2002 

 where possible the company has obtained sites in existing buildings requiring minimal alterations this has allowed ross to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time at reasonable costs in a given market to date the company has been able to secure leases in suitable locations for its stores at february 1 2003 the majority of the companys stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years with three to four renewal options of five years each the average unexpired original lease term of its leased stores is five years or 20 years if renewal options are included see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements

 sales the 18 total sales increase for 2002 reflects a 7 increase in sales from “comparable” stores stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months the opening of 55 net new stores in 2002 and the full year impact of 2001 store openings the 10 total sales increase for 2001 reflects a 3 increase in sales from comparable stores the opening of 43 net new stores in 2001 and the full year impact of 2000 store openings the 10 total sales increase in 2000 reflects a 1 increase in comparable store sales the opening of 31 net new stores and the full year impact of 1999 store openings 

the company’s sales mix as shown below reflects the growth in home businesses which was a key contributor to comparable store sales growth in 2002 and 2001 

 management expects to address the competitive climate for apparel and offprice retailers by pursuing and refining the company’s existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen the merchandise organization diversifying the merchandise mix and more fully developing the organization and systems to strengthen regional merchandise offerings although the company’s existing strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales and earnings gains in 2002 2001 and 2000 there can be no assurance that these strategies will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth 

cost of goods sold the decrease in the cost of goods sold ratio in 2002 compared to 2001 resulted in part from higher leverage on buying distribution occupancy and depreciation costs in 2002 when compared to 2001 buying and distribution costs as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 30 basis points from 2001 which is largely attributable to improved leverage resulting from a 7 comparable store sales increase and distribution processing efficiencies the 7 increase in comparable store sales also resulted in an approximate 25 basis point reduction in store occupancy and depreciation as a percentage of sales when compared to 2001 in addition the company realized about 15 basis points of improvement in merchandise margins in 2002 as compared to 2001 due primarily to lower markdowns and improved shortage results partially offset by higher freight costs and a reduction in initial markup due to our sharper pricing strategy 

the increase in the cost of goods sold ratio in 2001 compared to 2000 resulted in part from higher distribution center expenses and reduced leverage on occupancy and buying costs in 2001 when compared to 2000 buying and distribution costs as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 40 basis points in 2001 mainly as a result of higher third party distribution processing costs store occupancy and depreciation as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 10 basis points when compared to 2000 due primarily to an 11 increase in new store openings as compared to an 8 gain in the prior year in addition the company realized about 10 basis points in lower merchandise margins in 2001 as compared to 2000 due primarily to a reduction on initial markup due to an improved mix of brandname merchandise 

there can be no assurance that the gross profit margins realized in 2002 2001 and 2000 will continue in future years 

general selling and administrative expenses total general selling and administrative expenses “gsa” were 5723 million in 2002 an 869 million increase from 2001 during 2002 gsa as a percentage of sales decreased slightly due primarily to higher leverage on store payroll benefit costs and operating costs partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation costs store operating costs as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 20 basis points from 2001 due primarily to improved leverage resulting from a 7 comparable store sales increase general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales grew by approximately 15 basis points in 2002 due mainly to an increase in incentive compensation costs partially offset by improved leverage 

total gsa was 4855 million in 2001 a 470 million increase from 2000 during 2001 gsa as a percentage of sales rose primarily due to higher store payroll and operating costs as compared to 2000 store operating costs as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 25 basis points from 2000 due mainly to higher payroll and benefit costs as compared to the prior year general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 20 basis points primarily due to improved leverage 

the largest component of gsa is payroll the total number of employees including both full and parttime at yearend 2002 2001 and 2000 was approximately 22500 21000 and 19800 respectively 

interest expense the decrease in interest expense in 2002 as compared to 2001 and 2000 as a percentage of sales is mainly due to lower average borrowings 

taxes on earnings the companys effective tax rate for 2002 2001 and 2000 was approximately 39 which represents the applicable federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit received for state taxes during 2003 the company expects its effective tax rate to remain at approximately 39 

net earnings the increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2002 as compared to 2001 is primarily due to improved leverage realized from the increase in comparable store sales growth on store expenses and on buying distribution occupancy and depreciation costs in 2002 when compared to 2001 combined with slightly higher merchandise margins which was partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs diluted earnings per share in 2002 increased by 32 to 252 from 191 in 2001 this increase is attributable to the 30 increase in net earnings and a 2 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding the decrease in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2001 as compared to 2000 is primarily due to higher distribution payroll and benefit costs partially offset by improved leverage on fixed expenses diluted earnings per share in 2001 increased by 5 to 191 from 182 in 2000 this increase is attributable to the 2 increase in net earnings and a 3 reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3324 million 2429 million and 1433 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the primary source of cash from operations in 2002 2001 and 2000 is related to net earnings excluding noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization higher accounts payable and other accrued expense balances partially offset by cash used to finance an increase in merchandise inventories working capital was 296 million at the end of 2002 compared to 225 million at the end of 2001 and 197 million at the end of 2000 the company had a current ratio of 151 in 2002 2001 and 2000 the companys primary source of liquidity is the sale of its merchandise inventory management regularly reviews the age and condition of the merchandise and is able to maintain current inventory in its stores through the replenishment processes and liquidation of noncurrent merchandise through clearance markdowns 

investing activities 

in 2002 2001 and 2000 the company spent approximately 1332 million 860 million and 821 million respectively for capital expenditures net of leased equipment related primarily to fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores relocate remodel or expand existing stores update management information systems and various other expenditures for existing stores distribution centers and the central office the company opened 60 45 and 34 new stores and relocated remodeled or expanded 1 14 and 21 stores in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

financing activities 

during 2002 2001 and 2000 liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from operations bank credit facilities and trade credit substantially all of the companys store sites certain warehouses and buying offices are leased and except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment do not represent longterm capital investments the company owns its distribution center and corporate headquarters in newark california and its distribution center in carlisle pennsylvania shortterm trade credit represents a significant source of financing for investments in merchandise inventory trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with the companys vendors management regularly reviews the adequacy of credit available to the company from all sources and has been able to maintain adequate lines to meet the capital and liquidity requirements of the company 

the table below presents significant contractual payment obligations of the company at yearend 2002 

contractual obligations

offbalance sheet arrangements 

operating leases substantially all of the company’s store sites certain warehouses and buying offices are leased the company owns its distribution center and corporate headquarters in newark california and its distribution center in carlisle pennsylvania 

distribution center financings the company leases a new 13 million square foot distribution center in fort mill south carolina which was completed in july 2002 this center including equipment and systems is being financed under an 873 million fiveyear operating lease commonly referred to as a synthetic lease which expires in may 2006 monthly rent expense is currently payable at 75 basis points over 30day libor at the end of the lease term the company must refinance the 873 million synthetic lease facility purchase the distribution center at cost or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party the company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to 85 of the amount financed the company’s potential estimated purchase obligation of 873 million is included in other synthetic lease obligations in the table above 

in april 2002 construction began on another 13 million square foot distribution center which is expected to be complete in the third quarter of 2003 this new center is located in perris california approximately 70 miles southeast of los angeles a desirable location for both sourcing and shipping of product more than 25 of the company’s store base is in the southwest region of the country and the majority of its west coast merchandise receipts originate in southern california the perris distribution center will feature the same warehouse management systems and technology installed in the new south carolina center the company believes the new perris center should improve supply chain logistics and efficiencies and result in higher distribution center productivity and improved freight costs as a result the company plans to transfer its primary west coast distribution capabilities from its current 19 yearold newark distribution center to the new perris center during the third quarter of 2003 

the land and building portion of the new perris center is being financed under an 80 million fiveyear synthetic lease facility which expires in december 2006 upon completion rent expense on this center will be payable monthly at the applicable margin currently 71 basis points over the applicable commercial paper rate or 30day libor at the end of the lease term the company must refinance the 80 million synthetic lease facility purchase the distribution center at cost or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party if the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than the amount financed by the lessor or 80 million the company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to 87 of the amount financed the company’s potential estimated purchase obligation of 80 million is included in other synthetic lease obligations in the table above the equipment and systems for the perris california center were financed with the 50 million fiveyear senior unsecured term debt facility which is included in longterm debt in the table above 

the two synthetic lease facilities described above have covenant restrictions requiring maintaining certain interest rate coverage and leverage ratios in addition the interest rates under these agreements may vary depending on the company’s actual interest coverage ratios 

these synthetic lease facilities are not included in the company’s consolidated balance sheet as of february 1 2003 the financial accounting standards board has recently issued authoritative guidance which could require the company to consolidate the underlying assets and liabilities of one or both of these synthetic lease facilities in our consolidated balance sheet see further discussion under “new accounting pronouncements”

the company estimates that cash flows from operations existing bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating cash needs fund the aforementioned planned capital investments repurchase common stock and make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months 

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2002 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs sfas no 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance principally emerging issues task force issue no 943 and is effective for restructuring activities if any initiated after december 31 2002 sfas no 146 requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred under issue no 943 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the companys commitment to an exit plan sfas no 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at 

its fair value accordingly sfas no 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs if any as well as the amounts recognized but will have no impact on exit liabilities recorded by the company prior to december 31 2002 

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure—an amendment of fasb statement no 123” this statement amends fasb sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition sfas no 148 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results the adoption of sfas no 148 did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

in november 2002 the fasb issued fasb interpretation “fin” no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued it also requires that a guarantor recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december 15 2002 the adoption of fin 45 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

on january 17 2003 the fasb issued fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards these entities have been commonly referred to as special purpose entities the underlying principle behind fin 46 is that if a business enterprise has the majority financial interest in an entity defined in the guidance as a variable interest entity the assets liabilities and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise fin 46 explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity the company will apply the provisions of fin 46 prospectively for all variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 for variable interest entities created before january 31 2003 the company will be required to consolidate all entities in which it was deemed to be the primary beneficiary beginning in the third quarter of 2003 

as of february 1 2003 the company was party to an agreement with a variable interest entity to finance and lease the perris california distribution center as further described in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements under existing accounting guidance neither the project assets nor related obligations are currently included in the companys balance sheets as the variable interest entity is currently structured the company would be considered the primary beneficiary under fin 46 and would be required to consolidate the entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003 fin 46 requires that the company consolidate the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the variable interest entities at their carrying amounts as if fin 46 had been effective when the enterprise first met the conditions to be the primary beneficiary based upon the project costs incurred through february 1 2003 consolidation of the variable interest entities would result in an additional 40 million in property and related debt as of february 1 2003 the company expects to spend a total of approximately 80 million upon completion of the perris distribution center which would result in an 80 million increase in property and 

related debt and approximately 23 million of annual depreciation if the company were to consolidate this variable interest entity the company may consider other financing structures for these projects in the future which may result in nonconsolidation under fin 46 the company does not anticipate the changes in accounting requirements to impact planned levels of financing or its credit ratings 

the company was also a party to an 87 million synthetic lease facility for its south carolina distribution center as further described in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements the company believes that consolidation of this synthetic lease will not be required under fin 46 because the lessorowner of the distribution center is not a variable interest entity further guidance or clarification related to fin 46 may be issued by the fasb securities and exchange commission or other authoritative bodies which could impact the accounting for this synthetic lease 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

inventory  the company’s merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if sales of the inventory are more difficult than anticipated additional inventory writedowns may be required 

longlived assets  the company records a longlived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows in the course of performing this analysis management determined that no longlived asset impairment charge was required for years ended february 1 2003 february 2 2002 and february 3 2001 should actual results differ materially from projected results an impairment charge may be required in the future 

self insurance  the company self insures certain of its workers’ compensation and general liability risks as well as certain of its health insurance plans the company’s selfinsurance liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of the medical profession and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 

the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company’s accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for management’s judgment in their application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result see the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 

forwardlooking statements and factors affecting future performance 

this report includes a number of forwardlooking statements which reflect the company’s current beliefs and estimates with respect to future events and the company’s future financial performance operations and competitive position the words “expect” “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “looking ahead” “forecast” “plan” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements 

the company’s continued success depends in part upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis there can be no assurance that the company’s existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict 

the forwardlooking statements that are contained in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from historical results or current expectations these factors include without limitation a general deterioration in economic trends changes in geopolitical conditions ongoing competitive pressures in the apparel industry the company’s ability to obtain acceptable store locations the company’s ability to continue to purchase attractive brandname merchandise at desirable discounts the company’s ability to successfully open its distribution center in southern california in a timely and costeffective manner the company’s ability to successfully extend its geographic reach into new markets unseasonable weather trends changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences in apparel or homerelated merchandise the company’s ability to attract and retain personnel with the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies the company’s ability to implement and integrate various new systems and technologies and greater than planned costs in addition the company’s corporate headquarters one of its distribution centers and 35 of its stores are located in california therefore a downturn in the california economy or a major natural disaster there could significantly affect the company’s operating results and financial condition 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
