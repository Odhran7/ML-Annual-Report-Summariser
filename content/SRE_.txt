overview 

we are a californiabased holding company with energy infrastructure investments in north america our businesses invest in develop and operate energy infrastructure and provide electric and gas services to customers through regulated public utilities 

sempra was formed in 1998 through a business combination of enova and pe the holding companies of our regulated public utilities in california sdge which began operations in 1881 and socalgas which began operations in 1867 we have since expanded our regulated public utility presence into texas through our 8025 interest in oncor and 50 interest in sharyland utilities 

we have a strong and growing presence in mexico through a diverse portfolio of energy infrastructure projects and assets serving mexico’s growing energy needs our energy infrastructure footprint also includes our 502 interest in cameron lng jv which is a natural gas liquefaction export facility operating in louisiana and construction and development of lng projects and assets on the gulf coast and pacific coast of north america 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 we formed sempra infrastructure a new segment that includes the operating companies of our subsidiary si partners as well as a holding company and certain services companies through an internal reorganization we consolidated the assets of our lng business previously included in our sempra lng segment and our ownership of ienova previously included in our sempra mexico segment under sempra global previously included in parent and other which was renamed si partners this reorganization simplifies sempra’s ownership and management of its nonutility energy infrastructure assets in north america by consolidating them under a single platform as a result the sempra lng and sempra mexico segments no longer exist our historical segment disclosures have been restated to conform with the current presentation so that all segment discussions reflect the revised segment information of our four separate reportable segments 

in 2018 we announced a multiphase portfolio optimization initiative designed to sharpen our strategic focus on north america we have since executed on that initiative by completing the sales of our renewables businesses and our nonutility natural gas storage assets in the us and by completing the sales of our businesses in south america we present the south american businesses as discontinued operations throughout this report 

business strategy 

our mission is to be north america’s premier energy infrastructure company we are primarily focused on transmission and distribution investments among other areas that we believe are capable of producing stable cash flows and earnings visibility with the goal of delivering safe and reliable energy to our customers and increasing shareholder value

sdge 

sdge is a regulated public utility that provides electric services to a population of at december 31 2021 approximately 36 million and natural gas services to approximately 33 million of that population covering a 4100 square mile service territory in southern california that encompasses san diego county and an adjacent portion of orange county 

table of c ontents 

sdge’s assets at december 31 2021 covered the following territory 

electric utility operations 

electric transmission and distribution system service to sdge’s customers is supported by its electric transmission and distribution system which includes substations and overhead and underground lines these electric facilities are primarily in the san diego imperial and orange counties of california and in arizona and nevada and consisted of 2148 miles of transmission lines 23829 miles of distribution lines and 160 substations at december 31 2021 occasionally various areas of the service territory require expansion to accommodate customer growth and maintain reliability and safety 

sdge’s 500kv southwest powerlink transmission line which is shared with arizona public service company and imperial irrigation district extends from palo verde arizona to san diego california sdge’s share of the line is 1162 mw although it can be less under certain system conditions sdge’s sunrise powerlink is a 500kv transmission line constructed and operated by sdge with import capability of 1000 mw of power 

mexico’s baja california transmission system is connected to sdge’s system via two 230kv interconnections with combined capacity of up to 600 mw in the northtosouth direction and 800 mw in the southtonorth direction although it can be less under certain system conditions 

edison’s transmission system is connected to sdge’s system via five 230kv transmission lines 

table of c ontents 

electric resources to meet customer demand sdge supplies power from its own electric generation facilities and procures power on a longterm basis from other suppliers for resale through cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts or through purchases on the spot market sdge does not earn any return on commodity sales volumes sdge’s supply at december 31 2021 was as follows 



1   excludes approximately 128 mw of energy storage owned and approximately 164 mw of energy storage contracted 

2   sdge owns and operates four natural gasfired power plants three of which are in california and one of which is in nevada 

charges under contracts with suppliers are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity tolling contracts are purchasedpower contracts under which sdge provides natural gas for generation to the energy supplier 

sdge procures natural gas under shortterm contracts for its owned generation facilities and for certain tolling contracts associated with purchasedpower arrangements purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

sdge is a participant in the western systems power pool which includes an electricpower and transmissionrate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities power agencies energy brokers and power marketers located throughout the us and canada participants can make power transactions on standardized terms including marketbased rates preapproved by the ferc participation in the western systems power pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk 

customers and demand sdge provides electric services through the generation transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes 



1 includes intercompany sales 

sdge currently provides procurement service for most of its customer load however some customers can receive procurement service from a loadserving entity other than sdge through programs such as cca and da in such cases sdge no longer procures energy for this departing load accordingly sdge’s cca and da customers receive primarily transportation and distribution services from sdge 

cca is only available if the customer’s local jurisdiction city offers such a program and da is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours a number of jurisdictions in sdge’s territory including the city and county of san diego and 14 other 

table of c ontents 

municipalities have implemented are implementing or are considering implementing cca based on our current expectations sdge could procure energy for less than half of its current customer load by december 31 2022 

sdge’s historical energy procurement may exceed the needs of its bundled customers as customers elect cca and da service accordingly the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources could then be borne by sdge’s remaining bundled procurement customers to help achieve the goal of ratepayer indifference whether or not customers’ energy is procured by sdge or by cca or da the cpuc revised the power charge indifference adjustment framework sdge implemented the framework on january 1 2019 by adopting several refinements designed to more equitably share energy procurement costs among customers served by sdge and customers served by cca and da 

san diego’s mild climate and sdge’s robust energy efficiency programs contribute to lower consumption by our customers rooftop solar installations continue to reduce residential and commercial volumes sold by sdge at december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the residential and commercial rooftop solar capacity in sdge’s territory totaled 1620 mw 1423 mw and 1233 mw respectively 

demand for electricity is dependent on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products consumer preference environmental regulations legislation renewable power generation the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs demandside management impact and distributed generation resources california’s energy policy supports increased electrification particularly electrification of vehicles which could result in significant increases in sales volumes in the coming years other external factors such as the price of purchased power the use of hydroelectric power the use of and further development of renewable energy resources and energy storage development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in the market price of electricity which may in turn impact demand demand for electricity is also impacted by seasonal weather patterns or “seasonality” tending to increase in the summer months to meet cooling load and in the winter months to meet heating load 

competition sdge faces competition to serve its customer load from the growth in distributed and local power generation including solar installations in addition the electric industry is undergoing rapid technological change and thirdparty energy storage alternatives and other technologies may increasingly compete with sdge’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers however sdge does not earn any return on commodity sales 

natural gas utility operations 

we describe sdge’s natural gas utility operations below in “sempra california’s natural gas utility operations” 

socalgas 

socalgas is a regulated public utility that owns and operates a natural gas distribution transmission and storage system that supplies natural gas to a population of at december 31 2021 approximately 22 million covering a 24000 square mile service territory that encompasses southern california and portions of central california excluding san diego county the city of long beach and the desert area of san bernardino county 

table of c ontents 

socalgas’ assets at december 31 2021 covered the following territory 

natural gas utility operations 

we describe socalgas’ natural gas utility operations below in “sempra california’s natural gas utility operations” 

sempra california’s natural gas utility operations 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

at december 31 2021 socalgas’ natural gas facilities included 3047 miles of transmission and storage pipelines 51724 miles of distribution pipelines 48549 miles of service pipelines and nine transmission compressor stations and sdge’s natural gas facilities consisted of 176 miles of transmission pipelines 9058 miles of distribution pipelines 6686 miles of service pipelines and one compressor station 

socalgas’ and sdge’s gas transmission pipelines interconnect with four major interstate pipeline systems el paso natural gas transwestern pipeline kern river pipeline company and mojave pipeline company allowing customers to bring gas supplies into the socalgas gas transmission pipeline system from the various outofstate gas producing basins additionally an interconnection with pge’s intrastate gas transmission pipeline system allows gas to flow into socalgas’ gas transmission pipeline system socalgas’ gas transmission pipeline system also has an interconnect with a mexican gas pipeline company at otay mesa on the californiamexico border that allows gas to not only flow south from the gas producing basins in the southwestern us but to also flow north into socalgas’ gas transmission pipeline system from lngsourced supplies in mexico there are also several instate gas interconnections allowing for delivery of californiaproduced gas including a number of direct connections from renewable natural gas producers 

socalgas purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for sdge’s and socalgas’ core customers socalgas purchases natural gas from various sources including from canada the us rockies and the southwestern regions of the us purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bid week indices 

to support the delivery of natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the needs of customers socalgas has firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights 

table of c ontents 

energy companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas 

natural gas storage 

socalgas owns four natural gas storage facilities with a combined working gas capacity of 137 bcf and 135 injection withdrawal and observation wells that provide natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers socalgas’ and sdge’s core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas’ storage capacity socalgas uses the remaining storage capacity for load balancing services for all customers and if available to others including sdge for its noncore customer requirements natural gas withdrawn from storage is important to help maintain service reliability during peak demand periods including consumer heating needs in the winter as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility has a storage capacity of 86 bcf and subject to the cpuc limitations described below represents 63 of socalgas’ natural gas storage capacity socalgas discovered a natural gas leak at one of its wells at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in october 2015 and permanently sealed the well in february 2016 socalgas was subsequently authorized to make limited withdrawals and injections of natural gas at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and on an interim basis has been directed by the cpuc to maintain up to 4116 bcf of working gas at the facility to help achieve reliability for the region at reasonable rates as determined by the cpuc to help maintain system reliability the cpuc issued a protocol authorizing withdrawals of natural gas from the facility if available gas supply and gas prices reach defined thresholds for socalgas’ system as determined by the protocol we discuss the leak in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part i – item 1a risk factors” and in “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – socalgas” 

customers and demand 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers in its territory and sdge’s territory on a combined portfolio basis socalgas also offers natural gas transportation and storage services for others 



1   includes intercompany sales 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase their natural gas supplies from producers marketers or brokers socalgas and sdge are obligated to maintain adequate delivery capacity to serve the requirements of all their core customers 

noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale and large commercial and industrial customers a portion of socalgas’ noncore customers are nonendusers which include wholesale customers consisting primarily 

table of c ontents 

of other utilities including sdge or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers 

noncore customers are responsible for procuring their natural gas requirements as the regulatory framework does not allow socalgas and sdge to recover the cost of natural gas procured and delivered to noncore customers 

demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products consumer preference environmental regulations legislation california’s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs other external factors such as weather the price of demand for and supply sources of electricity the use of and further development of renewable energy resources and energy storage development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas outside california and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price which may in turn impact demand 

one of the larger sources for natural gas demand is electric generation natural gasfired electric generation within southern california and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity growth in selfgeneration from rooftop solar the addition of more efficient gas technologies new energy efficiency initiatives and the degree to which regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from socalgas’ and sdge’s service areas the demand for natural gas may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to seasonality weather conditions and other impacts and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources given the significant quantity of natural gasfired generation we believe natural gas is a dispatchable fuel that can help provide electric reliability in our california service territories 

the natural gas distribution business is subject to seasonality and cash provided by operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry but subject to current regulatory limitations socalgas typically injects natural gas into storage during the months of april through october and usually withdraws natural gas from storage during the months of november through march 

sempra texas utilities 

sempra texas utilities is comprised of our equity method investments in oncor holdings and sharyland holdings oncor holdings is an indirect wholly owned entity of sempra that owns an 8025 interest in oncor tti owns the remaining 1975 interest in oncor sempra owns an indirect 50 interest in sharyland holdings which owns a 100 interest in sharyland utilities 

sempra texas utilities’ assets at december 31 2021 covered the following territory 

table of c ontents 

oncor 

oncor is a regulated electricity transmission and distribution utility that operates in the northcentral eastern western and panhandle regions of texas oncor delivers electricity to enduse consumers through its electrical systems and also provides transmission grid connections to merchant generation facilities and interconnections to other transmission grids in texas oncor’s transmission and distribution assets are located in over 120 counties and more than 400 incorporated municipalities including the cities of dallas and fort worth and surrounding suburbs as well as waco wichita falls odessa midland tyler temple killeen and round rock among others most of oncor’s power lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways streets and rightsofway as permitted by law 

at december 31 2021 oncor had 4537 employees including 772 employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement 

certain ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments which we describe in “part i – item 1a risk factors” are in effect and are intended to enhance oncor holdings’ and oncor’s separateness from their owners and to mitigate the risk that these entities would be negatively impacted by the bankruptcy of or other adverse financial developments affecting their owners sempra does not control oncor holdings or oncor and the ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to direct the management policies and operations of oncor holdings and oncor including the deployment or disposition of their assets declarations of dividends strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions including limited representation on the oncor holdings and oncor boards of directors because oncor holdings and oncor are managed independently ie ringfenced we account for our 100 ownership interest in oncor holdings as an equity method investment 

electricity transmission oncor’s electricity transmission business is responsible for the safe and reliable operations of its transmission network and substations these responsibilities consist of the construction and maintenance of transmission facilities and substations and the monitoring controlling and dispatching of highvoltage electricity over its transmission facilities in coordination with ercot which we discuss below in “regulation – utility regulation – ercot market” 

table of c ontents 

at december 31 2021 oncor’s transmission system included approximately 18249 circuit miles of transmission lines a total of 1174 transmission and distribution substations and interconnection to 130 thirdparty generation facilities totaling 45403 mw 

transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by either the puct or to a small degree related to limited interconnection to other markets the ferc network transmission revenues compensate oncor for delivery of electricity over transmission facilities operating at 60 kv and above other services offered by oncor through its transmission business include system impact studies facilities studies transformation service and maintenance of transformer equipment substations and transmission lines owned by other parties 

electricity distribution oncor’s electricity distribution business is responsible for the overall safe and reliable operation of distribution facilities including electricity delivery power quality and system reliability these responsibilities consist of the ownership management construction maintenance and operation of the electricity distribution system within its certificated service area oncor’s distribution system receives electricity from the transmission system through substations and distributes electricity to endusers and wholesale customers through 3679 distribution feeders 

oncor’s distribution system included more than 38 million points of delivery at december 31 2021 and consisted of 122441 miles of overhead and underground lines 

distribution revenues from residential and small business users are based on actual monthly consumption kwh and distribution revenues from large commercial and industrial users are based on depending on size and annual load factor either actual monthly demand kw or the greater of actual monthly demand kw or 80 of peak monthly demand during the prior eleven months 

customers and demand oncor operates the largest transmission and distribution system in texas delivering electricity to more than 38 million homes and businesses operating more than 140000 miles of transmission and distribution lines as of december 31 2021 in a territory with an estimated population of approximately 13 million the consumers of the electricity oncor delivers are free to choose their electricity supplier from retail electric providers who compete for their business accordingly oncor is not a seller of electricity nor does it purchase electricity for resale rather oncor provides transmission services to its electricity distribution business as well as nonaffiliated electricity distribution companies cooperatives and municipalities and distribution services to retail electric providers that sell electricity to retail customers at december 31 2021 oncor’s distribution customers consisted of approximately 95 retail electric providers and certain electric cooperatives in its certificated service area 

oncor’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other electricity usage drivers with revenues being highest in the summer 

competition oncor operates in certificated areas designated by the puct the majority of oncor’s service territory is single certificated with oncor as the only certificated electric transmission and distribution provider however in multicertificated areas of texas oncor competes with certain other utilities and rural electric cooperatives for the right to serve enduse customers in addition the electric industry is undergoing rapid technological change and thirdparty distributed energy resources and other technologies may increasingly compete with oncor’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers 

sharyland utilities 

sharyland utilities is a regulated electric transmission utility that owns and operates at december 31 2021 approximately 63 miles of electric transmission lines in south texas including a direct current line connecting mexico and assets in mcallen texas sharyland utilities is responsible for providing safe reliable and efficient transmission and substation services and investing to support infrastructure needs in its service territory which we discuss below in “regulation – utility regulation – ercot market” transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by the puct 

sempra infrastructure 

our sempra infrastructure segment includes the operating companies of our subsidiary si partners as well as a holding company and certain services companies si partners is included within our sempra infrastructure reportable segment but is not the same in its entirety as the reportable segment sempra infrastructure develops builds operates and invests in energy infrastructure to help enable the energy transition in north american markets and globally 

sempra infrastructure owned an 80 interest in si partners at december 31 2021 with the remaining 20 interest owned by kkr upon completion of its purchase of a nci in si partners on october 1 2021 on december 21 2021 sempra entered into a purchase and sale agreement with adia pursuant to which adia agreed to acquire a 10 nci in si partners the consummation of the adia transaction is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory and thirdparty approvals and other customary closing conditions following the closing of the adia transaction sempra kkr and adia would directly or 

table of c ontents 

indirectly own 70 20 and 10 respectively of the outstanding class a units of si partners si partners has two authorized classes of limited partnership interests designated as “class a units” which are common voting units and “sole risk interests” which are only owned by sempra are nonvoting and are not considered in the calculation of each limited partner’s respective ownership interests subject to certain restrictions we discuss kkr’s purchase and adia’s pending purchase of nci in si partners as well as si partners’ limited partnership agreement that governs the partners’ respective rights and obligations in respect of their ownership interests in si partners in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

si partners held a 100 ownership interest in sempra lng holding lp and a 999 ownership interest in ienova at december 31 2021 following completion of the exchange offer and cash tender offer to acquire the publicly owned shares of ienova which we discuss in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements si partners simplifies sempra’s ownership and management of its nonutility energy infrastructure assets in north america by consolidating them under a single platform these assets include lng and natural gas infrastructure in the us and mexico and renewable energy lpg and refined products infrastructure in mexico 

at december 31 2021 sempra infrastructure owned or held interests in the following assets 

lng and netzero solutions 

sempra infrastructure’s lng and netzero solutions business line is comprised of a natural gas liquefaction portfolio in operation construction or development and is focused on energy diversification and the clean energy transition in markets that our customers serve 

cameron lng jv sempra infrastructure owns 502 of cameron lng jv while an affiliate of totalenergies se an affiliate of mitsui  co ltd and japan lng investment llc a company jointly owned by mitsubishi corporation and nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha each own 166 of cameron lng jv we account for our ownership interest in cameron lng jv under the equity method no single owner controls or can unilaterally direct significant activities of cameron lng jv 

cameron lng jv owns cameron lng jv phase 1 a natural gas liquefaction export regasification and import facility with three natural gas pretreatment processing and liquefaction trains cameron lng jv phase 1 is located in hackberry louisiana along the calcasieu ship channel which handles significant industrial shipping including large oil and lng tankers and is well 

table of c ontents 

positioned to supply the atlantic and pacific markets cameron lng jv phase 1 achieved commercial operations of train 1 train 2 and train 3 in august 2019 february 2020 and august 2020 respectively the three liquefaction trains have a combined nameplate capacity of 139 mtpa of lng with an export capacity of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf of natural gas per day cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of totalenergies se mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd which collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the three trains at the facility 

eca regas facility sempra infrastructure owns and operates the eca regas facility in baja california mexico which is capable of processing one bcf of natural gas per day and has a storage capacity of 320000 cubic meters in two tanks of 160000 cubic meters each 

the eca regas facility generates revenues from firm storage service fees under firm storage service agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with shell mexico and gazprom that expire in 2028 which permit them to collectively use 50 of the terminal’s capacity with the remaining 50 of the capacity available for sempra infrastructure’s use shell mexico and gazprom have commenced binding arbitration to terminate these agreements and seek other relief the land on which the eca regas facility and the proposed eca lng liquefaction projects is situated as well as land adjacent to those properties are the subject of litigation we discuss the eca regas facility arbitration and land litigation in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

sempra infrastructure uses its 50 capacity at the eca regas facility to satisfy its obligation under an lng sale and purchase agreement with tangguh psc through 2029 which we discuss below and eca lng phase 1 will be the sole user of this capacity thereafter 

asset and supply optimization sempra infrastructure has an lng sale and purchase agreement through 2029 with tangguh psc for the supply of the equivalent of 500 mmcf of natural gas per day at a price based on the socal border index for natural gas the lng sale and purchase agreement allows tangguh psc to divert certain lng volumes to other global markets in exchange for payments of diversion fees sempra infrastructure may also enter into shortterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified at the eca regas facility for sale to other parties sempra infrastructure uses the natural gas produced from this lng to supply a contract for the sale of natural gas to the cfe at prices that are based on the socal border index if lng volumes received from tangguh psc are not sufficient to satisfy the commitment to the cfe sempra infrastructure may purchase natural gas in the market to satisfy such commitment 

sempra infrastructure purchases transports and sells natural gas and has customers in both the us and mexico including the cfe sempra infrastructure may also purchase natural gas from other sempra affiliates natural gas purchases and transportation arrangements are substantially backed by longterm us dollarbased contracts for the sale of natural gas to third parties both us sourced and derived from imported lng lng offtake and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity 

eca lng phase 1 sempra infrastructure owns an 834 interest in eca lng phase 1 and an affiliate of totalenergies se owns the remaining 166 interest eca lng phase 1 is constructing a onetrain natural gas liquefaction facility at the site of sempra infrastructure’s existing eca regas facility with a nameplate capacity of 325 mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of 25 mtpa we expect eca lng phase 1 to begin producing lng by the end of 2024 

eca lng phase 1 has definitive 20year lng sale and purchase agreements with an affiliate of totalenergies se for approximately 17 mtpa of lng and mitsui  co ltd for approximately 08 mtpa of lng 

the construction of the eca lng phase 1 project is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties see “part i – item 1a risk factors” and “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – sempra infrastructure” 

additional potential lng and netzero solutions’ projects sempra infrastructure is evaluating the following development opportunities 

▪ cameron lng jv phase 2 project an expansion of cameron lng jv’s liquefaction export facility 

▪ eca lng phase 2 project a largescale natural gas liquefaction export project to be located at the site of sempra infrastructure’s existing eca regas facility in baja california mexico 

▪ port arthur lng a largescale natural gas liquefaction export project and associated infrastructure on a greenfield site in the vicinity of port arthur texas located along the sabineneches waterway 

▪ vista pacifico lng a midscale natural gas liquefaction export project and associated infrastructure in the vicinity of topolobampo in sinaloa mexico 

▪ baja sur lng an earlystage regasification facility in la paz baja california sur mexico 

▪ hackberry carbon storage a carbon capture and sequestration project that is intended to reduce emissions at cameron lng jv 

table of c ontents 

no final investment decision has been reached for any of these potential projects the development of these projects is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties for a discussion of these proposed projects and their risks see “part i – item 1a risk factors” and “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – sempra infrastructure” 

demand and competition north america benefits from numerous competitive advantages as a potential supplier of lng to world markets including but not limited to the following 

▪ high levels of developed and undeveloped natural gas resources including unconventional natural gas and tight oil relative to domestic consumption levels 

▪ flexible and elastic markets in gas and oil drilling and production resulting in efficient unit costs of gas production 

▪ availability of extensive preexisting natural gas pipeline transmission systems and natural gas storage capacity with proximity to production locations 

brownfield liquefaction projects also benefit from the particular competitive advantage of the proximity of preexisting infrastructure such as lng tankage and berths 

global lng competition may limit north american lng exports as international liquefaction projects attempt to match north american lng production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility it is expected that north american lng exports will increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand and thereby facilitate additional growth of a global commodity market for natural gas and lng 

additionally our cameron lng jv coowners and customers compete globally to market and sell lng to end users including gas and electric utilities located in lngimporting countries around the world by providing liquefaction services cameron lng jv and future lng export development projects compete indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global lng market in addition to the us these competitors are located in the middle east southeast asia africa south america australia and europe 

the lng regasification business is impacted by worldwide lng market prices high lng prices in markets outside the market in which sempra infrastructure’s eca regas facility operates have resulted and could continue to result in lowerthanexpected deliveries of lng cargoes to the eca regas facility which could increase costs if sempra infrastructure is instead required to obtain lng in the open market at prevailing prices any inability to obtain expected lng cargoes could also impact sempra infrastructure’s ability to maintain the minimum level of lng required to keep the eca regas facility in operation at the proper temperature prices in international lng markets through which sempra infrastructure must purchase natural gas to meet its contractual obligations to deliver natural gas to customers may also affect how sempra infrastructure optimizes its assets and supply which could have an adverse impact on its earnings 

energy networks 

sempra infrastructure’s energy networks business line is comprised of a natural gas transportation and distribution network 

crossborder interconnections and incountry pipelines sempra infrastructure develops builds operates and invests in systems for the receipt transportation compression and delivery of natural gas and ethane at december 31 2021 these systems consisted of 1850 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines plus 124 miles in development 16 natural gas compression stations plus one in development and 139 miles of ethane pipelines in mexico the design capacity of these pipeline assets is over 16400 mmcf per day of natural gas 204 mmcf per day of ethane gas and 106000 barrels per day of ethane liquid capacity on sempra infrastructure’s pipelines and related assets is substantially contracted under longterm us dollarbased agreements with major industry participants such as the cfe cenagas pemex shell mexico gazprom and other similar counterparties some of these pipeline assets are affected by disputes related to the property on which the pipelines are located which we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

sempra infrastructure owns a 40mile natural gas pipeline in south louisiana the cameron interstate pipeline which links the cameron lng jv phase 1 facility in cameron parish in louisiana to five interstate pipelines that offer access to major feed gas supply basins in texas and the northeast midcontinent and southeast regions of the us the majority of transportation capacity on the cameron interstate pipeline is under longterm transportation service agreements with shippers for delivery to cameron lng jv phase 1 

natural gas distribution sempra infrastructure’s natural gas distribution regulated utility ecogas operates in three separate distribution zones in mexicali chihuahua and la lagunadurango mexico at december 31 2021 ecogas had approximately 2842 miles of distribution pipeline and approximately 143000 customer meters serving more than 489000 residential commercial and industrial consumers with sales volume of approximately 10 mmcf per day in 2021 ecogas relies on supply and transportation services from sempra infrastructure socalgas and pemex for the natural gas it distributes to its customers

lpg storage and associated systems sempra infrastructure owns and operates the tdf s de r l de c v tdf pipeline system and the guadalajara lpg terminal at december 31 2021 the tdf pipeline system consisted of approximately 118 miles of 12inch diameter lpg pipeline with a design capacity of 34000 barrels per day and associated storage and dispatch facilities the tdf pipeline system runs from pemex’s burgos facility in the state of tamaulipas mexico to sempra infrastructure’s delivery facility near the city of monterrey mexico and is fully contracted to pemex on a firm basis through 2027 sempra infrastructure’s guadalajara lpg terminal is an 80000barrel lpg storage facility near guadalajara mexico with associated loading and dispatch facilities and serves the lpg needs of guadalajara the guadalajara lpg terminal is fully contracted to pemex on a firm basis through 2028 both contracts are us dollardenominated or referenced and are periodically adjusted for inflation 

refined products storage sempra infrastructure’s refined products storage business develops constructs and operates systems for the receipt storage and delivery of refined products principally gasoline diesel and jet fuel throughout the mexico states of baja california colima puebla sinaloa veracruz and valle de méxico for private companies the veracruz marine terminal reached commercial operations in march 2021 and the inland terminal in the vicinity of mexico city reached commercial operations in july 2021 the two terminals have a combined storage capacity of more than 27 million barrels our customer contracts for our refined products storage business are structured as longterm us dollardenominated firm capacity storage agreements with counterparties including chevron corporation marathon petroleum corporation and valero energy corporation the contracted rate under these contracts is independent from each terminal’s regulated rate as determined by the cre 

at december 31 2021 sempra infrastructure had marine and inland terminals under development and construction with a projected storage capacity of approximately 5 million barrels we expect the topolobampo marine terminal to reach commercial operations in the first half of 2022 the inland terminal in the vicinity of puebla has been temporarily shut down during the pendency of an industrywide investigation initiated by the cre to enforce mexico’s fuel procurement laws and its storage permit may be at risk due to a separate cre administrative proceeding we discuss this investigation and other risks and uncertainties related to the construction of these projects in “part i – item 1a risk factors” and “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – sempra infrastructure” 

demand and competition ecogas faces competition from other distributors of natural gas in each of its three distribution zones in mexicali chihuahua and la lagunadurango mexico as other distributors of natural gas build or consider building natural gas distribution systems sempra infrastructure’s pipeline and storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated pipeline and storage facilities they compete primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets the overall demand for natural gas distribution services increases during the winter months while the overall demand for power increases during the summer months 

clean power 

sempra infrastructure’s clean power business line consists of a renewable energy infrastructure portfolio and a natural gasfired power plant in mexico 

renewable power generation sempra infrastructure develops builds invests in and operates renewable energy generation facilities that have longterm ppas to sell the electricity they generate to their customers which are generally load serving entities as well as industrial and other customers load serving entities sell electric service to their endusers and wholesale customers upon receipt of power delivery from these energy generation facilities while industrial and other customers consume the electricity to run their facilities at december 31 2021 sempra infrastructure had a fully contracted total nameplate capacity of 1044 mw related to its wind and solar power generation facilities that were either fully operating or under construction some of these facilities are impacted by regulatory actions by the mexican government and related litigation which we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements “part i – item 1a risk factors” and “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – sempra infrastructure”

1 commenced commercial operations in january 2022 

natural gasfired generation  sempra infrastructure owns and operates the tdm power plant in the vicinity of mexicali baja california adjacent to the mexicous border tdm is a 625mw natural gasfired combinedcycle power plant that commenced commercial operations in june 2003 the power plant is connected to our gasoducto rosarito pipeline system which enables it to receive regasified lng from the eca regas facility as well as continental gas supplied from the us on the north baja pipeline tdm generates revenue from selling electricity and resource adequacy to the california iso and to governmental public utility and wholesale power marketing entities 

demand and competition sempra infrastructure competes with mexican and foreign companies for new energy infrastructure projects in mexico some of its competitors including public or stateoperated companies and their affiliates may have better access to capital and greater financial and other resources which could give them a competitive advantage for such projects 

generation from sempra infrastructure’s renewable energy assets is susceptible to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind inclement weather and hours of sunlight because sempra infrastructure sells power that it generates at its esj wind power generation facility into california sempra infrastructure’s future performance and the demand for renewable energy may be impacted by us state mandated requirements to deliver a portion of total energy load from renewable energy sources the rules governing these requirements in california are generally known as the rps program in california certification of a generation project by the cec as an err allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements if such purchase meets the provisions of sb x12 the california renewable energy resources act the rps program may affect the demand for output from renewable energy projects developed by sempra infrastructure particularly the demand from california’s utilities the first phase of esj a wind power generation facility that delivers energy into california has been certified by the cec and is in compliance with the rps program as of december 31 2021 sempra infrastructure is pursuing err certification for the second phase of esj 

tdm competes daily with other generating plants that supply power into the california electricity market sempra infrastructure manages commodity price risk at tdm by using a mix of day ahead sales of energy energy spreads hedging ancillary services and shortterm to mediumterm capacity sales

utility regulation 

california 

sdge and socalgas are principally regulated at the state level by the cpuc cec and carb 

the cpuc 

▪ consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for staggered sixyear terms 

▪ regulates among other things sdge’s and socalgas’ customer rates and conditions of service sales of securities rates of return capital structure rates of depreciation and longterm resource procurement except as described below in “us federal” 

▪ has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric generation transmission and distribution and natural gas storage transmission and distribution facilities in california 

▪ conducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines and conducts investigations related to various matters such as safety reliability and planning deregulation competition and the environment and 

▪ regulates the interactions and transactions of sdge and socalgas with sempra and its other affiliates 

the cpuc also oversees and regulates other energyrelated products and services including solar and wind energy bioenergy alternative energy storage and other forms of renewable energy in addition the cpuc’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety and other violations 

the cec publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based on these forecasts the cec 

▪ determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs 

▪ sponsors alternativeenergy research and development projects 

▪ promotes energy conservation programs to reduce demand for natural gas and electricity within california 

▪ maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages and 

▪ certifies powerplant sites and related facilities within california 

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support sdge’s and socalgas’ longterm investment decisions 

california requires certain of its electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver a significant percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the rps program 

ab 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 assigns responsibility to carb for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing ghg emissions the law requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emissions reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a department within the california environmental protection agency an organization that reports directly to the governor’s office sempra infrastructure is also subject to the rules and regulations of carb 

the operation and maintenance of socalgas’ natural gas storage facilities are regulated by calgem and the cpuc as well as various other state and local agencies 

texas 

oncor’s and sharyland utilities’ rates are regulated at the state level by the puct and in the case of oncor at the city level by certain cities the puct has original jurisdiction over wholesale transmission rates and services and retail rates and services in unincorporated areas and in those municipalities that have ceded original jurisdiction to the puct and has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review the retail rate and service orders and ordinances of municipalities generally the texas pura prohibits the collection of any rates or charges by a public utility as defined by pura that do not have the prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authority ie the puct or the municipality with original jurisdiction 

at the state level pura requires utility owners or operators of electric transmission facilities to provide openaccess wholesale transmission services to third parties at rates and terms that are nondiscriminatory and comparable to the rates and terms of the utility’s own use of its system the puct has adopted rules implementing the state openaccess requirements for all utilities that are subject to the puct’s jurisdiction over electric transmission services including oncor 

table of c ontents 

us federal 

sdge and socalgas are also regulated at the federal level by the ferc the epa the doe and the dot and for sdge the nrc 

the ferc regulates sdge’s and socalgas’ interstate sale and transportation of natural gas the ferc also regulates sdge’s transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access rates of return on transmission investment rates of depreciation electric rates involving sales for resale and the application of the uniform system of accounts the us energy policy act governs procedures for requests for electric transmission service the california ious’ electric transmission facilities are under the operational control of the california iso as member utilities oncor and sharyland utilities operate within the ercot market which we discuss below to a small degree related to limited interconnections to other markets oncor’s electric transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by the ferc 

the nrc oversees the licensing construction operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities in the us including songs in which sdge owns a 20 interest and which was permanently retired in 2013 the nrc and various state regulations require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities we provide further discussion of songs matters including the closure and decommissioning of the facility in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the epa implements federal laws to protect human health and the environment including federal laws on air quality water quality wastewater discharge solid waste management and hazardous waste disposal and remediation the epa also sets national environmental standards that state and tribal governments implement through their own regulations sdge socalgas oncor and sharyland utilities are therefore subject to an interrelated framework of environmental laws and regulations 

the dot through phmsa has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures including procedures intended to manage cybersecurity risks applicable to sdge’s and socalgas’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines as well as natural gas storage facilities the dot has certified the cpuc to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in california 

ercot market 

as member utilities oncor and sharyland utilities operate within the ercot market which represents approximately 90 of the electricity consumption in texas ercot is the regional reliability coordinating organization for member electricity systems in texas and the iso of the interconnected transmission grid for those systems ercot is subject to oversight by the puct and the texas legislature ercot is responsible for ensuring reliability adequacy and security of the electric systems as well as nondiscriminatory access to transmission service by all wholesale market participants in the ercot region ercot’s membership consists of corporate and associate members including electric cooperatives municipal power agencies independent generators independent power marketers transmission service providers distribution services providers independent retail electric providers and consumers 

the puct has primary jurisdiction over the ercot market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of power supply across texas’ main interconnected electric transmission grid oncor and sharyland utilities along with other owners of electric transmission and distribution facilities in texas participate with the ercot iso and other member utilities in its operations each of these texas utilities has planning design construction operation and maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and for the loadserving substations it owns primarily within its certificated distribution service area each participates with the ercot iso and other ercot utilities in obtaining regulatory approvals and planning designing constructing and upgrading transmission lines in order to remove any existing constraints and interconnect energy generation on the ercot transmission grid these transmission line projects are necessary to meet reliability needs support energy production and increase bulk power transfer capability 

oncor and sharyland utilities are subject to reliability standards adopted and enforced by the texas reliability entity inc an independent organization that develops reliability standards for the ercot region and monitors and enforces compliance with the standards of the north american electric reliability corporation including critical infrastructure protection and ercot protocols

ratemaking mechanisms 

sempra california 

general rate case proceedings 

a cpuc grc proceeding is designed to set sufficient base rates to allow sdge and socalgas to recover their reasonable forecasted operating costs and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on its investment the proceeding generally establishes the test year revenue requirements which authorizes how much sdge and socalgas can collect from their customers and provides for attrition or annual increases in revenue requirements for each year following the test year 

we discuss the grc in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cost of capital proceedings 

a cpuc cost of capital proceeding determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base which is a weightedaverage of the authorized returns on debt preferred equity and common equity referred to as return on equity or roe weighted on a basis consistent with the authorized capital structure the authorized return on rate base approved by the cpuc is the rate that sdge and socalgas use to establish customer rates to finance investments in cpucregulated electric distribution and generation natural gas distribution transmission and storage assets as well as general plant and information technology systems investments to support operations 

a cost of capital proceeding also addresses the ccm which applies in interim years between cost of capital proceedings and considers changes in the cost of capital based on changes in interest rates based on the applicable 12month average moody’s utility bond index the index applicable to each utility is based on each utility’s credit rating the ccm benchmark rates for sdge and socalgas are the basis of comparison to determine if future measurement periods “trigger” the ccm the trigger occurs if the change in the applicable average moody’s utility bond index relative to the ccm benchmark is larger than plus or minus 100 bps the ccm if triggered would automatically update the authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and update the authorized roe upward or downward by onehalf of the difference between the ccm benchmark and the applicable 12month average moody’s utility bond index unless the cpuc accepts a utility’s interim application to have its cost of capital assessed between regular cost of capital proceedings based on an extraordinary or catastrophic event that materially impacts the utility’s cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole sdge filed such an interim application in august 2021 due to the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic 

we discuss the cost of capital and ccm in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

transmission rate cases 

sdge files separately with the ferc for its authorized roe on fercregulated electric transmission operations and assets the proceeding establishes a roe and a formulaic rate whereby rates are determined using 1 a base period of historical costs and a forecast of capital investments and 2 a trueup period similar to balancing account treatment that is designed to provide earnings equal to sdge’s actual cost of service including its authorized return on investment sdge makes annual information filings with the ferc in december to update rates for the following calendar year sdge may also file for roe incentives that might apply under ferc rules sdge’s debttoequity ratio is set annually based on the actual ratio at the end of each year 

we discuss sdge’s to5 filing with the ferc in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

incentive mechanisms 

the cpuc applies certain performancebased measures and incentive mechanisms to all california ious under which sdge and socalgas have earnings potential above authorized cpuc base operating margin if they achieve or exceed specific performance and operating goals generally for performancebased measures if performance is above or below specific benchmarks the utility is eligible for financial awards or subject to financial penalties 

table of c ontents 

other costbased recovery 

the cpuc and the ferc as it relates to sdge authorize sdge and socalgas to collect revenue requirements from customers for operating costs and capital related costs such as depreciation taxes and return on rate base including 

▪ costs to purchase natural gas and electricity 

▪ costs associated with administering public purpose demand response and customer energy efficiency programs 

▪ other programmatic activities such as gas distribution gas transmission gas storage integrity management and wildfire mitigation and 

▪ costs associated with thirdparty liability insurance premiums 

authorized costs are recovered as the commodity or service is delivered to the extent authorized amounts collected vary from actual costs the differences are generally recovered or refunded within a subsequent period based on the nature of the balancing account mechanism in general the revenue recognition criteria for balanced costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred because these costs are substantially recovered in rates through a balancing account mechanism changes in these costs are reflected as changes in revenues the cpuc and the ferc may impose various review procedures before authorizing recovery or refund for programs authorized including limitations on the total cost of the program revenue requirement limits or reviews of costs for reasonableness these procedures could result in disallowances of recovery from ratepayers 

sempra texas utilities 

rates and cost recovery 

oncor’s and sharyland utilities’ rates are each regulated at the state level by the puct and in the case of oncor at the city level by certain cities and are subject to regulatory ratesetting processes and earnings oversight this regulatory treatment does not provide assurance as to achievement of earnings levels or recovery of actual costs instead their rates are based on an analysis of each utility’s costs and capital structure in a designated test year as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital however there is no assurance that the puct will judge all of the texas utilities’ costs to have been prudently incurred and therefore fully recoverable the approved levels of recovery could be significantly less than requested levels there can also be no assurance that the puct will approve other items proposed in any rate proceeding or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will necessarily result in rates that produce full recovery of the texas utilities’ actual posttest year costs andor the return on invested capital allowed by the puct 

the puct’s substantive rules allow texas electric utilities providing wholesale or retail distribution service to file under certain circumstances once per year and up to four rate adjustments between comprehensive base rate proceedings to recover distributionrelated investments on an interim basis the puct’s substantive rules also allow the texas utilities to update their transmission rates periodically on an interim basis to reflect changes in invested capital these “capital tracker” provisions are intended to encourage investment in the electric system to help ensure reliability and efficiency by allowing for timely recovery of and return on new transmission and distribution investments 

capital structure and return on equity 

oncor has a puctauthorized roe of 98 and an authorized regulatory capital structure of 575 debt to 425 equity on may 10 2021 oncor filed an application with the puct requesting to extend its base rate review filing deadline from october 1 2021 to june 1 2022 on july 29 2021 the puct approved an order granting the extension as a result oncor’s next base rate review must be filed on or before june 1 2022 

sharyland utilities’ puctauthorized roe is 938 and its authorized regulatory capital structure is 55 debt to 45 equity sharyland utilities filed its 2020 rate case with the puct in december 2020 and received puct approval on july 15 2021 

sempra infrastructure 

ecogas’ revenues are derived from service and distribution fees charged to its customers in mexican pesos the price ecogas pays to purchase natural gas which is based on international price indices is passed through directly to its customers the service and distribution fees charged by ecogas are regulated by the cre which performs a review of rates every five years and monitors prices charged to endusers in the fourth quarter of 2020 ecogas filed its rate case for the period 2021 through 2025 ecogas expects to receive a decision in the first half of 2022 the tariffs operate under a returnonassetbase model in the annual tariff adjustment rates are adjusted to account for inflation or fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation indexing includes separate us and mexican cost components so that us costs can be included in the final distribution rates

risks related to sempra 

operational and structural risks 

sempra’s cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments 

we are a holding company and substantially all our assets are owned by our subsidiaries or entities we do not control including equity method investments our ability to pay dividends and meet our debt and other obligations largely depends on cash flows from our subsidiaries and equity method investments which in turn depend on their ability to execute their business strategies and generate cash flows in excess of their own expenditures common and preferred dividends if any and debt and other obligations in addition entities accounted for as equity method investments which we do not control and our subsidiaries are all separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us and could be precluded from doing so by legislation regulation court order or contractual restrictions in times of financial distress or in other circumstances the inability to access capital from our subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

sempra’s rights to the assets of its subsidiaries and equity method investments are structurally subordinated to the claims of each entity’s trade and other creditors in addition if sempra is a creditor of any such entity its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the entity’s assets and any indebtedness of the entity senior to that held by sempra sempra may elect to make capital contributions to its subsidiaries unlike a loan there is no obligation for a subsidiary to repay a capital contribution to its parent which cannot be accessed by the parent and becomes structurally subordinated to claims by creditors of the applicable subsidiary 

sempra has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses it does not control or manage or in which it shares control 

we have and make investments in businesses we do not control or manage or in which we share control including as a result of sales of a portion of our ownership interest in some of our businesses in some cases we engage in arrangements with or for these businesses that could expose us to risks in addition to our investment including guarantees indemnities and loans for businesses we do not control we are subject to the decisions of others which may not always be in our interest and could negatively affect us in addition irrespective of whether or not we control these businesses we could be responsible for liabilities or losses related to the businesses or elect to make capital contributions to these businesses during times of financial distress that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we discuss these investments further in notes 5 6 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

when we share control of a business with other owners any disagreements among the owners about strategy financial operational transactional or other important matters could hinder the business from moving forward with key initiatives or taking other actions and could negatively affect the relationships among the owners and the efficient functioning of the business any such circumstance could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

table of c ontents 

our business could be negatively affected by actions of activist shareholders 

activist shareholders may engage in proxy solicitations advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes in or assert influence on our board of directors and management in taking these steps activist shareholders could seek to acquire our capital stock which in high volumes could threaten our ability to use some or all of our nol carryforwards if it results in our corporation undergoing an “ownership change” under applicable tax rules responding to activist shareholders could require us to incur legal and advisory fees proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require time and attention by our board of directors and management diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategies 

any perceived uncertainties about our future direction or control our ability to execute our strategies or the composition of our board of directors or management team arising from activist shareholder attention or other action could lead to a perception of instability or a change in the direction of our business which could be exploited by our competitors andor other activist shareholders result in the loss of business opportunities and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects further any such actions could cause fluctuations in the trading prices of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors 

financial and capital stockrelated risks 

any impairment of our assets or investments could negatively impact us 

we could experience a reduction in the fair value of our assets including our longlived assets intangible assets or goodwill andor our investments that we account for under the equity method upon the occurrence of many of the risks discussed in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report including any closure of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility without adequate cost recovery any inability to operate our existing facilities or develop new projects in mexico due to proposed changes to existing laws or regulations or other circumstances affecting the energy sector or our assets in that country and more generally any loss of permits or approvals that requires us to adjust or cease certain operations and any investment in capital projects that do not receive required approvals or are changed abandoned or otherwise not completed any such reduction in the fair value of our assets or investments could result in an impairment loss that could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which the charge is recorded we discuss our impairment testing of longlived assets and goodwill and the factors considered in such testing in “part ii – item 7 mda – critical accounting estimates” and in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the economic interest voting rights and market value of our outstanding common and preferred stock may be adversely affected by any additional equity securities we may issue 

at february 18 2022 we have 315653893 shares of our common stock and 900000 shares of our nonconvertible series c preferred stock outstanding we may seek to raise capital by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities which may materially dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our outstanding common and preferred stock and materially adversely affect the trading price of our common and preferred stock 

dividend requirements associated with our preferred stock subject us to risks 

any failure to pay scheduled dividends on our series c preferred stock when due would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our preferred stock our common stock and our debt securities and would prohibit us under the terms of the preferred stock from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of our common stock subject to limited exceptions until we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock additionally the terms of the series c preferred stock generally provide that if dividends on any shares of the preferred stock have not been declared and paid or have been declared but not paid for three or more semiannual dividend periods whether or not consecutive the holders of the preferred stock would be entitled to elect two additional members to our board of directors subject to certain terms and limitations 

our common stock is listed on the mexican stock exchange and registered with the cnbv which subjects us to additional regulation and liability in mexico 

in addition to being listed for trading on the nyse our common stock is listed for trading on the mexican stock exchange and registered with the cnbv such listing and registration subjects us to filing and other requirements in mexico that could increase costs and increase performance risk of personnel given additional responsibilities in addition the cnbv as the mexican securities market regulator has the authority to make inspections of sempra’s business primarily in the form of requests for information and documents impose fines or other penalties on sempra and its directors and officers for violations of mexican

risks related to all sempra businesses 

operational risks 

our businesses are subject to risks arising from their infrastructure and information systems 

our businesses own and operate electric transmission distribution and storage facilities natural gas transmission distribution regasification liquefaction and storage facilities and other energy infrastructure which are in many cases interconnected andor managed by information technology systems even though our businesses undertake capital investment projects to construct replace maintain improve and upgrade their respective facilities and information systems there is a risk of among other things potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure and systems human error shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment materials or labor operational restrictions resulting from environmental requirements or governmental interventions inability to enter into maintain extend or replace longterm supply contracts and performance below expected levels and these risks could be amplified while capital investment projects are in process because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by these or similar events occurring on the systems of such third parties some of which may be unanticipated or uncontrollable by us 

additional risks associated with the ability of our businesses to safely and reliably operate maintain improve and upgrade their respective facilities and systems many of which are beyond our businesses’ control include 

▪ failure to meet customer demand for electricity andor natural gas including electrical blackout curtailments or gas outages 

▪ natural gas surges into homes or other properties 

▪ the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air water or soil including gas leaks 

▪ inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to catastrophic events 

the occurrence of any of these events could affect demand for electricity natural gas or other forms of energy cause unplanned outages damage our businesses’ assets andor operations damage the assets andor operations of third parties on which our businesses rely damage property owned by customers or others and cause personal injury or death any such outcome could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

our businesses face risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has been materially impacting communities supply chains economies and markets around the world since march 2020 to date the covid19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our results of operations however sempra and some or all its businesses have been and could continue to be impacted by this pandemic or any future pandemic in a number of ways including 

▪ implementing protocols and processes to comply with applicable government mandates related to virus exposure testing and vaccination 

▪ conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel and work locations and virtualization of certain business activities which could result in increased employee turnover or absenteeism decreased efficiency and productivity and other similar affects that could increase operating costs and jeopardize our ability to satisfy compliance requirements and sustain operations 

▪ disruption in the capital markets which has affected and could further affect liquidity strategic initiatives and prospects including in some cases a slowdown of planned capital spending 

▪ customerprotection measures implemented by sdge and socalgas including suspending service disconnections due to nonpayment for all customers except for socalgas’ noncore customers waiving late payment fees offering flexible payment plans and automatically enrolling residential and small business customers with pastdue balances in longterm repayment plans which have collectively resulted in a reduction in payments from sdge and socalgas’ customers and an increase in uncollectible accounts that could become material and may not be fully recoverable 

▪ precautionary preemptive and responsive actions taken by our current and prospective counterparties customers and partners as well as regulators and other governing bodies that affect our businesses which have affected and could further affect our operations results liquidity and ability to pursue capital projects and strategic initiatives 

any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we will continue to actively monitor the effects of the covid19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our 

table of c ontents 

business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are necessary for the safety of our employees customers partners and suppliers and generally the communities we serve however we cannot at this time predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may further impact our businesses 

severe weather natural disasters and other similar events could materially adversely affect us 

our facilities and infrastructure including projects in development and under construction may be damaged by severe weather natural disasters accidents explosions or acts of terrorism war or criminality because we are in the business of using storing transporting and disposing of highly flammable explosive and radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure as well as the risks to the surrounding communities for which we could be held responsible are substantially greater than the risks such incidents pose to a typical business 

such incidents could result in business and project development disruptions power outages property damage injuries and loss of life for which we could be liable and could cause secondary incidents that also may have these or other negative effects such as fires leaks of natural gas natural gas odorant propane ethane other ghg emissions or radioactive material spills or other damage to natural resources or other nuisances to affected communities any of these occurrences could decrease revenues and earnings andor increase costs including maintenance costs or restoration expenses amounts associated with claims against us and regulatory fines penalties and disallowances in some cases we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault such as when the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies which we discuss further below under “risks related to sempra california – operational risks” for our regulated utilities these costs may not be recoverable in rates insurance coverage for these costs may increase or become prohibitively expensive be disputed by insurers or become unavailable for certain of these risks or at sufficient levels and any insurance proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to limitations exclusions high deductibles failure to comply with procedural requirements or other factors such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners supply chains and transportation which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide electricity and natural gas to customers moreover weatherrelated incidents have become more prevalent unpredictable and severe as a result of climate change or other factors and we are currently experiencing a global pandemic any of which could have a greater impact on our businesses than currently anticipated and for our regulated utilities rates may not be adequately or timely adjusted to reflect any such increased impact any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

we seek growth opportunities in the market organically and inorganically including through the acquisition of or partnerships in operating companies 

we diligently analyze the financial viability of each acquisition partnership and jv we pursue however our diligence may prove to be insufficient and there could be difficulties in integrating acquired assets to our standards or in a timely manner or latent unforeseen defects in addition we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from future acquisitions partnerships or jvs such as increased earnings cost savings or revenue enhancements for various reasons including difficulties integrating operations and personnel higher and unexpected acquisition and operating costs unknown liabilities and fluctuations in markets any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

increasing activities and projects intended to advance new energy technologies could introduce new risks to our businesses 

we may periodically undertake or become involved in research and development projects and other activities designed to develop new technologies in the energy space including those related to hydrogen energy storage carbon sequestration grid modernization and others these activities and projects can involve significant employee time as well as substantial capital resources that may not be recoverable in rates or with respect to our nonregulated utility businesses may not be able to be passed through to customers in addition the timing to complete these activities and projects is inherently uncertain and may require significantly more time and funding than we initially anticipate moreover many of these technologies are in the early stage of development and the applicable activities and projects may not be completed or the applicable technologies may not prove economically and technically feasible if any of these circumstances occurs we may not recover or receive an adequate or any return on our investment and other resources invested in these activities and our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected 

the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees 

several of our businesses have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions which are generally negotiated on a companybycompany basis any failure to negotiate and reach an agreement on these labor contracts could result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions any such labor disruption or negotiated wage or benefit increases whether due to 

table of c ontents 

union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

in addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face we face evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and energy grid natural gas pipeline storage and other infrastructure 

our businesses collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees and our operations rely on complex interconnected networks of generation transmission distribution storage control and communication technologies and systems our use of business technologies including deployment of any new technologies represents a largescale opportunity for attacks on or other failures to protect our information systems confidential information and energy grid and natural gas infrastructure in particular cyber and other attacks targeting utility systems and other energy infrastructures as well as the impacts of these attacks on companies and their communities are increasing in sophistication magnitude and frequency and may further increase in the event of geopolitical events and other uncertainties such as the conflict in ukraine additionally sdge and socalgas are increasingly required to disclose large amounts of data including customer energy usage and personal information about customers to support changes to california’s electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice increasing the risks of inadvertent disclosure or other unauthorized access of sensitive information further the virtualization of many business activities during the covid19 pandemic increases cyber risk and generally there has been an associated increase in targeted cyberattacks moreover all our businesses operating in california are subject to enhanced state privacy laws which require companies that collect information about california residents to among other things make disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and be liable under a new cause of action for breaches of certain highly sensitive personal information and other states in which we do business could adopt similar laws 

although we invest in risk management and information security measures for the protection of our systems and information these measures could be insufficient or otherwise fail the costs and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing these protection measures are significant and they could materially increase to address increasingly intense and complex cyber risks we often rely on thirdparty vendors to deploy new business technologies and maintain modify and update our systems and these third parties may not have adequate risk management and information security measures with respect to their systems any cyberattack including ransomware attacks on our or our vendors’ information systems or the integrity of the energy grid our pipelines or our distribution storage and other infrastructure or unauthorized access damage or improper disclosure of confidential information could result in disruptions to our business operations regulatory compliance failures inabilities to produce accurate and timely financial statements energy delivery failures financial and reputational loss customer dissatisfaction litigation violation of privacy laws and fines or penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects although sempra currently maintains cyber liability insurance this insurance is limited in scope and subject to exceptions conditions and coverage limitations and may not cover any or even a substantial portion of the costs associated with any compromise of our information systems or confidential information and there is no guarantee that the insurance we currently maintain will continue to be available at rates we believe are commercially reasonable 

financial risks 

our debt service obligations expose us to risks and with respect to sempra could require additional equity securities issuances 

our businesses have debt service obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects by among other things 

▪ making it more difficult and costly for each of these businesses to service pay or refinance their debts as they become due particularly during adverse economic or industry conditions 

▪ limiting flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities or react to business developments or changes in the industry sectors in which they operate 

▪ requiring cash to be used for debt service payments thereby reducing the cash available for other purposes 

▪ causing lenders to require materially adverse terms in the instruments for new debt such as restrictions on uses of proceeds or other assets or limitations on incurring additional debt creating liens paying dividends repurchasing stock making investments or receiving distributions from subsidiaries or equity method investments 

table of c ontents 

sempra’s goal is to maintain or improve its credit ratings but it may not be able to do so to maintain these credit ratings we may seek to reduce our outstanding indebtedness with the proceeds from issuances of equity securities we may not be able to complete equity issuances on terms we consider acceptable or at all and any new equity we do issue may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of existing holders of sempra’s common andor preferred stock any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

the availability and cost of debt or equity financing could be negatively affected by market and economic conditions and other factors and any such effects could materially adversely affect us  

our businesses are capitalintensive in general we rely on longterm debt to fund a significant portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and shortterm borrowings to fund a significant portion of daytoday business operations sempra may also seek to raise capital by issuing equity or selling equity interests in our subsidiaries or investments 

limitations on the availability of credit increases in interest rates or credit spreads or other negative effects on the terms of any debt or equity financing could cause us to fund operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or fail to raise our targeted amount of funding which could negatively impact our ability to meet contractual and other commitments pursue development projects make nonsafety related capital expenditures and sustain operations any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

in addition to market and economic conditions factors that can affect the availability and cost of capital include 

▪ adverse changes to laws and regulations including the recent and proposed changes to the regulation of the energy market in mexico 

▪ the overall health of the energy industry 

▪ volatility in electricity or natural gas prices 

▪ for sempra sdge and socalgas risks related to california wildfires 

▪ for sempra sdge and socalgas any deterioration of or uncertainty in the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in california 

▪ credit ratings downgrades 

we are subject to risks due to uncertainty relating to the calculation of libor and its scheduled discontinuance 

certain of our financial and commercial agreements including those for variable rate indebtedness as well as interest rate derivatives incorporate libor as a benchmark for establishing certain rates as directed by the us federal reserve banks ceased making new liborbased issuances at the end of 2021 and publication of certain key us dollar libor tenors for existing loans is expected to cease in mid2023 these events could cause libor to perform differently than it has performed historically use of the secured overnight financing rate sofr which has been identified as the replacement benchmark rate for libor may result in interest payments that are higher than expected or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made using libor changes to or the discontinuance of libor any uncertainty regarding such changes or discontinuance and the performance and characteristics of alternative benchmark rates could negatively affect our existing and future variable rate indebtedness and interest rate hedges and the cost of doing business under our commercial agreements that incorporate libor and could require us to seek to amend the terms of the relevant indebtedness or agreements which may be materially worse than existing terms the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place those ratings on negative outlook 

credit rating agencies routinely evaluate sempra sdge socalgas and si partners and certain of our other businesses and their ratings are based on a number of factors including the factors described below and the ability to generate cash flows level of indebtedness overall financial strength specific transactions or events such as share repurchases and significant litigation the status of certain capital projects and the state of the economy and our industry generally these credit ratings could be downgraded or other negative credit rating actions could occur at any time we discuss these credit ratings further in “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity” 

for sempra moody’s sp and fitch collectively the rating agencies have noted that the following events among others could lead to negative ratings actions 

▪ expansion of natural gas liquefaction projects or other unregulated businesses in a manner inconsistent with its present level of credit quality 

▪ sempra’s consolidated financial measures do not improve or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics 

table of c ontents 

▪ catastrophic wildfires caused by sdge or catastrophic wildfires caused by any california electric ious that participate in the wildfire fund which could exhaust the fund considerably earlier than expected 

▪ a ratings downgrade at sdge socalgas andor si partners 

for sdge the rating agencies have noted that the following events among others could lead to negative ratings actions 

▪ catastrophic wildfires caused by sdge or other california electric ious 

▪ a consistent weakening of sdge’s financial metrics or a deterioration in the regulatory environment 

▪ a ratings downgrade at sempra 

for socalgas the rating agencies have noted that the following events among others could lead to negative ratings actions 

▪ socalgas’ financial measures consistently weaken or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics 

▪ socalgas experiences increased business risk including a deterioration in the regulatory environment leading to weakening of its standalone business risk profile 

▪ a ratings downgrade at sempra 

for si partners the rating agencies have noted that the following events among others could lead to negative ratings actions 

▪ si partners’ failure to meet certain financial credit metrics 

▪ a deterioration in si partners’ business risk profile including incremental construction risk or adverse changes in the operating environment in mexico 

▪ a ratings downgrade at sempra 

a downgrade of any of our businesses’ credit ratings or ratings outlooks as well as the reasons for such downgrades may materially adversely affect the market prices of our equity and debt securities the interest rates at which borrowings can be made and debt securities issued and the various fees on credit facilities this could make it more costly for the affected businesses to borrow money issue equity or debt securities andor raise other types of capital any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and contractual commitments and our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

we do not fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices and for those contract positions that are hedged our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as expected 

we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps andor options among others to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity to try to reduce our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the extent of the coverage to these exposures varies over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as expected fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects certain of the contracts we may use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting which may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts that may not reflect the associated gains or losses of the underlying position being hedged and could result in fluctuations of our results from period to period 

risk management procedures may not prevent or mitigate losses 

although we have in place risk management and control systems designed to quantify and manage risk these systems may not prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended or function as expected in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits which are primarily based on historic price movements and which we discuss further in “part ii – item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” may not protect us from losses if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices as a result of these and other factors our risk management procedures and systems may not prevent or mitigate losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

market performance or changes in other assumptions could require unplanned contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

sempra sdge and socalgas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees the cost of providing these benefits is affected by many factors including the market value of plan assets and the other factors described in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements a decline in the market value of plan assets or an adverse change in any of these other factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations for these plans which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

table of c ontents 

legal and regulatory risks 

our businesses require numerous permits licenses franchises and other approvals from various governmental agencies and the failure to obtain or maintain any of them could materially adversely affect us 

our businesses require numerous permits licenses rightsofway franchises certificates and other approvals from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies these approvals may not be granted in a timely manner or at all or may be modified rescinded or fail to be extended for a variety of reasons obtaining or maintaining these approvals could result in higher costs or the imposition of conditions or restrictions on our operations further these approvals require compliance by us and may require compliance by our customers which could result in modification suspension or rescission and subject us to fines and penalties if these requirements are not complied with if one or more of these approvals were to be suspended rescinded or otherwise terminated including due to expiration or legal or regulatory changes or modified in a manner that makes our continued operation of the applicable business prohibitively expensive or otherwise undesirable or impossible we may be required to adjust or temporarily or permanently cease certain of our operations sell the associated assets or remove them from service andor construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area in which case we may lose some of our rate base or revenuegenerating assets our development projects may be negatively affected and we may incur impairment charges or other costs that may not be recoverable the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

we may invest funds in capital projects prior to receiving all regulatory approvals if there is a delay in obtaining these approvals if any approval is conditioned on changes or other requirements that increase costs or impose restrictions on our existing or planned operations if we fail to obtain or maintain these approvals or comply with them or other applicable laws or regulations if we are involved in litigation that adversely impacts any approval or rights to the applicable property or if management decides not to proceed with a project we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project any such occurrence could cause our costs to materially increase result in material impairments and otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

our businesses are facing climate change concerns and have environmental compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on us 

climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect our businesses in many ways including increasing the costs we incur in providing our services and the energy we transmit impacting the demand for and consumption of our services and the energy we transmit due to changes in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate energy customers are also increasingly indicating preferences for carbonneutral and renewable sources of energy 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes orders rules and regulations relating to environmental protection and climate change to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring and surveillance pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees and these amounts could increase as a result of various factors we may not control including if requirements change enforcement of requirements increases permits are not issued renewed or amended as anticipated energy demands increase or our mix of energy supplies changes in addition we may be responsible for onsite liabilities associated with the environmental and site condition of our projects and properties regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown which exposes us to risks arising from contamination at our existing and former facilities and offsite waste disposal sites that have been used in our operations for our regulated utilities some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject our businesses to fines and penalties including criminal penalties in some cases andor curtailments of our operations any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

increasing international national regional and statelevel environmental concerns and related new or proposed legislation and regulation or changes to existing legislation or regulation such as increased requirements for monitoring and surveillance pollution monitoring and control equipment safety practices emission fees taxes penalties or other obligations or restrictions may have material negative effects on our operations operating costs corporate planning and the scope and economics of proposed expansions infrastructure projects or other capital expenditures in particular existing and potential new or amended legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions and climate change may materially restrict our operations negatively impact demand for our services andor the energy we transmit limit development opportunities force costly or otherwise burdensome changes to our operations or otherwise materially adversely affect us for example sb 100 requires each california electric utility including sdge to procure at least 50 of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2026 and 60 by 2030 sb 100 also creates the policy of meeting all of california’s retail 

table of c ontents 

electricity supply with a mix of rps programeligible and zerocarbon resources by 2045 the law also includes stipulations that this policy not increase carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid and not allow resource shuffling and requires that the cpuc cec carb and other state agencies incorporate this policy into all relevant planning in addition to signing sb 100 into law the thengovernor of california also signed an executive order establishing a new statewide goal to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible and no later than 2045 and achieve and maintain net negative emissions thereafter the executive order calls on carb to address this goal in future scoping plans which affect several major sectors of california’s economy including transportation agriculture development industrial and others california has issued new climate initiatives in line with this statewide goal including two executive orders requiring sales of all passenger vehicles to be zeroemission by 2035 

moreover shifts in investor sentiment regarding fossil fuels is leading some to reduce investment in or divest from the sector completely maintaining investor confidence and attracting capital will be dependent on successfully demonstrating our ability to reduce emissions associated with our operations and the energy we transmit consistent with our aim to have netzero emissions by 2050 our ability to reach netzero emissions by 2050 depends on many factors some of which we do not control including supportive energy laws and policies development and availability of alternative fuels successful research and development efforts focused on lowcarbon technologies that are economically and technically feasible cooperation from our partners financing sources and commercial counterparties and customer participation in conservation and energy efficiency programs although we have developed interim targets and various plans designed to support california in reaching its ghg emissions mandates including sb 100 and our own energy goals we may not be successful 

we will need to continue to make capital expenditures and incur costs to develop and deploy new technologies and modernize grid systems in our efforts to achieve our climate targets and those mandated by applicable authorities which may not be recoverable in rates or with respect to our nonregulated utility businesses may not be able to be passed through to customers even if such costs are recoverable the resulting rates or other costs to customers may increase to levels that reduce customer demand and growth sdge and socalgas as well as any of our other businesses affected by ghg emissions mandates may also be subject to fines and penalties if mandated renewable energy goals are not met and all of our businesses could suffer reputational harm if we do not meet or scale back our ghg emissions goals or there are negative views about our environmental practices generally any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

our businesses are subject to numerous governmental regulations and complex tax and accounting requirements and may be materially adversely affected by these regulations or requirements or any changes to them 

the electric power and natural gas industries are subject to numerous governmental regulations and our businesses are also subject to complex tax and accounting requirements these regulations and requirements may undergo changes at the federal state local and foreign levels including in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these regulations and requirements including in the event of changes to them or how they are implemented interpreted or enforced could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect how we conduct our business new tax legislation regulations or interpretations or changes in tax policies in the us or other countries in which we operate or do business could negatively affect our tax expense andor tax balances and our businesses generally any failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could subject us to fines and penalties including criminal penalties in some cases and result in the temporary or permanent shutdown of certain facilities or operations the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among sdge socalgas and other sempra businesses these rules are commonly referred to as “affiliate rules” and they primarily impact transmission supply capacity and marketing activities including restricting our ability to sell natural gas or electricity to or trade with sdge and socalgas and its ability to effect these transactions with each other these rules as well as any changes to these rules or their interpretations or additional more restrictive cpuc or ferc rules related to transactions with affiliates could materially adversely affect our operations and in turn our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

we may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or other proceedings in which we are involved 

our businesses are involved in a number of lawsuits binding arbitrations and regulatory proceedings we discuss material pending proceedings in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we have spent and continue to spend substantial money time and employee and management focus on these lawsuits and other proceedings and on related investigations and regulatory matters the uncertainties inherent in lawsuits and other proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the timing costs and ranges of costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property

operational risks 

wildfires in california pose risks to sempra california particularly sdge and sempra 

potential for increased and more severe wildfires 

over the past few years california has been experiencing some of the largest wildfires measured by acres burned in its history frequent and more severe drought conditions inconsistent and extreme swings in precipitation changes in vegetation unseasonably warm temperatures very low humidity stronger winds and other factors have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the intensity and prevalence of wildfires in california including in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories and have made these wildfires increasingly difficult to prevent and contain changing weather patterns including as a result of climate change could cause these conditions to become even more extreme and unpredictable these wildfires could jeopardize thirdparty property and sdge’s and socalgas’ electric and natural gas infrastructure and result in temporary power shortages in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories certain of california’s local land use policies and forestry management practices have been relaxed to allow for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in highrisk fire areas which could lead to increased thirdparty claims and greater losses in the event of fires in these areas for which sdge or socalgas may be liable any such wildfires in sdge’s and socalgas’ territories could materially adversely affect sdge’s socalgas’ and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects which we discuss further in this risk factor below and above under “risks related to all sempra businesses – operational risks”

in july 2019 the wildfire legislation was signed into law which we discuss in further detail in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the wildfire legislation’s revised legal standard for the recovery of wildfire costs may not be implemented effectively or applied consistently we may not be eligible for the wildfire legislation’s cap on wildfirerelated liability if sdge fails to maintain a valid annual safety certification from the oeis andor the wildfire fund could be exhausted due to claims against the fund by sdge or other participating ious as a result of fires in their respective service territories any of which could have a material adverse effect on sempra’s and sdge’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects pge has indicated that it will seek reimbursement from the wildfire fund for losses associated with the dixie fire which burned from july 2021 through october 2021 and was reported to be the largest single wildfire measured by acres burned in california history in addition the wildfire legislation did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation which imposes strict liability meaning that liability is imposed regardless of fault on a utility whose equipment such as its electric distribution and transmission lines is determined to be a cause of a fire in such an event the utility would be responsible for the costs of damages including potential business interruption losses and interest and attorneys’ fees even if the utility has not been found negligent the doctrine of inverse condemnation also is not exclusive of other theories of liability including if the utility were found negligent in which case additional liabilities such as fire suppression cleanup and evacuation costs medical expenses and personal injury punitive and other damages could be imposed we are unable to predict the impact of the wildfire legislation on sdge’s ability to recover costs and expenses in the event that sdge’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation if a major fire is determined to be caused by sdge’s equipment or if a major fire is determined to be caused by another participating iou and the wildfire fund is depleted as a result sempra’s and sdge’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected 

cost recovery through insurance or rates 

as a result of the strict liability standard applied to electric ioucaused wildfires in california substantial recent losses recorded by insurance companies and the risk of an increase in the number and size of wildfires obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could be caused by sdge or socalgas particularly sdge has become increasingly difficult and costly if these conditions continue or worsen insurance for wildfire liabilities may become unavailable or may become prohibitively expensive and we may be challenged or unsuccessful when we seek recovery of increases in the cost of insurance through the regulatory process in addition insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses we may incur or it may not be 

table of c ontents 

available in sufficient amounts to meet the 1 billion of primary insurance required by the wildfire legislation we are unable to predict whether we would be able to recover in rates or from the wildfire fund the amount of any uninsured losses a loss that is not fully insured is not sufficiently covered by the wildfire fund andor cannot be recovered in customer rates such as the cpuc decision denying sdge’s recovery of costs related to wildfires in its service territory in 2007 could materially adversely affect sempra’s and one or both of sdge’s and socalgas’ results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

wildfire mitigation efforts 

although we spend significant resources on measures designed to mitigate wildfire risks these measures may not be effective in preventing wildfires or reducing our wildfirerelated losses and their costs may not be fully recoverable in rates sdge is required by applicable california law to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the oeis and could be subject to increased risks if these plans are not approved in a timely manner and fines or penalties for any failure to comply with the approved plans one of our wildfire mitigation and safety tools is to deenergize certain of our facilities when certain weather conditions become extreme and there is elevated wildfire ignition risk these “public safety power shutoffs” have been subject to scrutiny by various stakeholders including customers regulators and lawmakers which could lead to legislation or rulemaking that increases the risk of penalties and liability for damages associated with these events such costs may not be recoverable in rates unrecoverable costs adverse legislation or rulemaking scrutiny by key stakeholders ineffective wildfire mitigation measures or other negative effects associated with these efforts could materially adversely affect sempra’s and sdge’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

the electricity industry is undergoing significant change including increased deployment of distributed energy resources technological advancements and political and regulatory developments 

electric utilities in california are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources ders such as solar generation energy storage energy efficiency and demand response technologies and california’s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of these changes this growth of ders will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to among other things accommodate increasing twoway flows of electricity and increase the grid’s capacity to interconnect these resources in addition enabling california’s clean energy goals will require sustained investments in grid modernization renewable integration projects energy efficiency programs energy storage options and electric vehicle infrastructure the growth of the thirdparty energy storage alternatives and other technologies may increasingly compete with sdge’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers the cpuc is conducting proceedings to evaluate various projects and pilots implement changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid to prepare for higher penetration of ders consider future grid modernization and grid investments evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by ders determine what if any compensation would be feasible and appropriate and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator these proceedings and the broader changes in california’s electricity industry could result in new regulations policies andor operational changes that could materially adversely affect sdge’s and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

sdge provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a longterm basis while sdge currently provides such procurement service for most of its customer load some customers can receive procurement service from a loadserving entity other than sdge through programs such as cca and da in such cases sdge no longer procures energy for this departing load cca is only available if a customer’s local jurisdiction city offers such a program and da is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours a number of jurisdictions in sdge’s territory including the city and county of san diego and 14 other municipalities have implemented are implementing or are considering implementing cca based on our current expectations sdge could procure energy for less than half of its current customer load by december 31 2022 sdge’s historical energy procurement may exceed the needs of its bundled customers as customers elect cca and da service accordingly the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources could then be borne by sdge’s remaining bundled procurement customers existing state law requires that customers having cca and da procure their electricity must absorb the cost of abovemarket electricity procurement commitments already made by sdge on their behalf which requirements are designed to equitably share costs among customers served by sdge and by cca and da if adequate mechanisms are not implemented to help ensure compliance with this law if the law changes or if the law does not function as intended to achieve ratepayer indifference remaining bundled customers of sdge could experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of cca and da customers prior to their departure or if all such costs are not recoverable in rates sdge could experience material increases in its unrecoverable commodity costs any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects

natural gas and natural gas storage have increasingly been the subject of political and public scrutiny including a desire by some to reduce or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source 

certain california legislators and stakeholder advocacy and activist groups have expressed a desire to limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source by advocating increased use of renewable electricity and electrification in lieu of the use of natural gas reducing methane emissions also has become a major focus of certain us legislators and the current us administration certain california state agencies and city governments have proposed policies or passed ordinances to prohibit or restrict the use and consumption of natural gas in new buildings appliances and other applications these policies and ordinances and any other similar regulatory action could have the effect of reducing natural gas use over time the cpuc has initiated an oir to among other things implement a longterm planning strategy to manage the state’s transition away from natural gasfueled technologies in an effort to meet california’s decarbonization goals carb california’s primary regulator for ghg emissions reduction programs continues to pursue plans for reducing ghg emissions in line with california’s climate goals that include proposals to reduce natural gas demand including more aggressive energy efficiency programs increased renewable electric generation and replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances a substantial reduction in or the elimination of natural gas as an energy source in california could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ sdge’s and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects including impairment of some or all of socalgas’ and sdge’s natural gas infrastructure assets if they were not permitted to be repurposed for alternative fuels required to be depreciated on an accelerated basis or become stranded without adequate recovery of and on the investments 

sdge may incur significant costs and liabilities from its partial ownership of a nuclear facility being decommissioned 

sdge has a 20 ownership interest in songs which we discuss further in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sdge and each of the other owners of songs is responsible for financing its share of the facility’s expenses and capital expenditures including those related to decommissioning activities although the facility is being decommissioned sdge’s ownership interest in songs continues to subject it to risks including 

▪ the potential release of radioactive material 

▪ the potential harmful effects from the former operation of the facility 

▪ limitations on the insurance commercially available to cover losses associated with operating and decommissioning the facility 

▪ uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning the facility 

sdge maintains the songs ndt to provide funds for nuclear decommissioning trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities which are subject to market fluctuations a decline in the market value of trust assets an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts or changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates technology and the cost of labor materials and equipment could increase the funding requirements for these trusts which costs may not be fully recoverable in rates in addition cpuc approval is required to make withdrawals from the ndt and cpuc approval for certain expenditures may be denied if the cpuc determines the expenditures are unreasonable in addition decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the songs ndt rate recovery for overruns would require cpuc approval which may not occur 

the occurrence of any of these events could result in a reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

legal and regulatory risks 

sdge and socalgas are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may materially adversely affect sempra sdge and socalgas 

rates and other financial matters 

the cpuc regulates sdge’s and socalgas’ customer rates except for sdge’s electric transmission rates that are regulated by the ferc and conditions of service as well as its sales of securities rates of return capital structure rates of depreciation longterm resource procurement and other financial matters in various ratemaking proceedings the cpuc also periodically approves sdge’s and socalgas’ customer rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs including income taxes and an authorized rate of return on investments while incorporating a riskbased decisionmaking framework as well as settlements with third parties the outcome of ratemaking proceedings can be affected by various factors many of which are not in our control including the level of opposition by intervening parties any rejection by the cpuc of settlements with third 

table of c ontents 

parties potential rate impacts increasing levels of regulatory review changes in the political regulatory or legislative environments and the opinions of regulators consumer and other stakeholder groups and customers these ratemaking proceedings include decisions about major programs in which sdge and socalgas make investments under an approved cpuc framework but which investments may remain subject to a cpuc filing or reasonableness review with unclear standards that may result in the disallowance of incurred costs sdge and socalgas also may be required to incur costs and make investments to comply with proposed legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives including those related to california’s climate goals and policies and its ability to recover these costs and investments may depend on the final form of the legislative or regulatory requirements and the ratemaking mechanisms associated with them recovery can also be affected by the timing and process of the ratemaking mechanism in which there can be a significant time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers’ rates and material differences between the forecasted and authorized costs embedded in rates which are set on a prospective basis and the actual costs incurred the cpuc may also experience delays in its decisions on recovery or may deny recovery altogether on the basis that costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect sdge’s and socalgas’ rates and its and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

in addition under the cpuc’s cost of capital framework sdge and socalgas are required to file new cost of capital applications every three years sdge’s and socalgas’ cost of capital are then assessed in the intervening years through the ccm the ccm if triggered by changes in key benchmark interest rates automatically updates sdge’s or socalgas’ as applicable authorized rates of return for that year for the 12months ended september 30 2021 socalgas did not trigger the ccm while sdge exceeded its benchmark rate which would trigger the ccm the cpuc alternatively provides that sdge and socalgas each has the right to have its cost of capital assessed through an application based on an extraordinary or catastrophic event that materially impacts its cost of capital and affect utilities differently than the market as a whole if the cpuc finds that the conditions are met to file such an application the ccm would not apply sdge has filed an application to have its cost of capital for 2022 assessed through a cost of capital proceeding based on the extraordinary events of the covid19 pandemic rather than have the ccm applied the cpuc has established a proceeding to determine if sdge’s cost of capital was impacted by an extraordinary event if the cpuc finds that there was not an extraordinary event the ccm trigger for sdge could materially adversely affect the results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects of sempra and sdge if the cpuc finds that there was an extraordinary event it will then determine whether to suspend the ccm for 2022 and preserve sdge’s current authorized cost of capital or hold a second phase of the proceeding to set a new cost of capital for 2022 we further discuss the ccm including the impact of sdge’s trigger of the ccm in the most recent measurement period in “part i – item 1 business – ratemaking mechanisms – sempra california – cost of capital proceedings” and in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets and other similar matters involving sdge these ratemaking mechanisms are subject to many risks similar to those described above regarding the cpuc 

cpuc authority over operational matters 

the cpuc has regulatory authority related to safety standards and practices competitive conditions  reliability and planning affiliate relationships and a wide range of other operational matters including citation programs concerning matters such as safety activity disconnection and billing practices resource adequacy and environmental compliance for example in june 2019 the cpuc opened an oii to determine whether socalgas’ and sempra’s organizational culture and governance prioritize safety phase 1 of the oii involved a cpuc consultant producing a report that evaluates organizational culture governance policies practices and accountability metrics in relation to operations including record of safety incidents in january 2022 the cpuc issued a ruling initiating phase 2 activities and entering the phase 1 consultant’s report into the record consistent with the recommendations of the phase 1 consultant’s report the ruling indicates that phase 2 will focus on constructive forwardlooking actions intended to improve safety outcomes in the future many of these standards and programs are becoming more stringent and could impose severe penalties including enforcement programs under which the cpuc staff can issue citations that in some cases can impose substantial fines the cpuc conducts reviews and audits of the matters under its authority and could launch investigations or open proceedings at any time on any such matter it deems appropriate the results of which could lead to citations disallowances fines and penalties as well as corrective or mitigation actions required to address any noncompliance that may not be sufficiently funded in customer rates or at all any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on sempra’s sdge’s and socalgas’ results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to sdge and socalgas in notes 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

influence of other organizations and potential regulatory changes 

sdge socalgas and sempra may be materially adversely affected by revisions or reinterpretations of existing or new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies any of which could change how sdge and socalgas operate affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms require them to incur additional expenses or otherwise materially adversely affect their and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

sdge and socalgas are also affected by numerous advocacy groups including california public advocates office the utility reform network utility consumers’ action network and the sierra club any success by any of these groups in directly or indirectly influencing regulatory bodies with authority over our operations could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s socalgas’ and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

socalgas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs expenses and other liabilities related to the leak a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance 

from october 23 2015 through february 11 2016 socalgas experienced a natural gas leak from one of the injectionandwithdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in los angeles county as further described in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements numerous lawsuits investigations and regulatory proceedings have been initiated in response to the leak resulting in significant costs 

civil litigation 

as of february 18 2022 approximately 390 lawsuits including approximately 36000 plaintiffs two consolidated class action complaints claims for violations of proposition 65 and shareholder derivative actions are pending against socalgas related to the leak some of which have also named sempra andor certain officers and directors of socalgas and sempra additional litigation including by public entities or criminal complaints may be filed against us related to the leak or our responses to it all pending cases are coordinated before a single court in the la superior court for pretrial management most of the lawsuits are the subject of an agreement entered into in september 2021 that would result in dismissal of the claims therein and releases by all participating plaintiffs of socalgas sempra and their respective affiliates from all claims related to the leak however this agreement is subject to various conditions to effectiveness including a minimum participation rate by the applicable plaintiffs and approvals by the la superior court which may not be satisfied if these conditions are not satisfied then the agreement will not become effective and all lawsuits subject to the agreement will remain pending if these conditions are satisfied then socalgas will be required to make payments of up to 18 billion to the participating plaintiffs the two class action complaints are the subject of agreements also entered into in september 2021 that would result in dismissal of the claims therein and releases by plaintiffs and class members one of these agreements requires approvals by the la superior court which may not be satisfied in which case the complaint will remain pending if the settlement is approved then socalgas will be required to pay 40 million to a class of property owners sempra elected to make an 800 million equity contribution to socalgas in september 2021 and may elect to make additional equity contributions in the future that are intended to maintain socalgas’ approved capital structure in connection with the accruals related to these agreements such amounts as well as the costs of defending against or settling or otherwise resolving the remaining pending lawsuits including any lawsuits filed by plaintiffs or class or putative class members who do not agree to settle under or opt out of the agreements described above and any compensatory statutory or punitive damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs if awarded or imposed could materially adversely affect socalgas’ and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we discuss these risks further above under “risks related to all sempra businesses – legal and regulatory risks” and in this risk factor below under “insurance and estimated costs” 

governmental investigations orders and additional regulation 

in june 2019 the cpuc opened an oii to consider penalties against socalgas for the leak the first phase will consider among other things whether socalgas violated applicable laws cpuc orders or decisions rules or requirements and whether socalgas engaged in unreasonable andor imprudent practices with respect to its operation and maintenance of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility or its related recordkeeping practices the sed has alleged hundreds of violations in this first phase asserting that socalgas violated california public utilities code section 451 and failed to cooperate in the investigation and to keep proper records the second phase will consider whether socalgas should be sanctioned for the leak and what damages fines or other penalties if any should be imposed for any violations unreasonable or imprudent practices or failure to sufficiently cooperate with the sed as determined by the cpuc in the first phase in addition the second phase will determine the ratemaking treatment or other disposition of costs incurred by socalgas in connection with the leak which could result in little or no recovery of such costs socalgas has engaged in settlement discussions with the sed in connection with this proceeding 

table of c ontents 

this oii and other investigations into the leak could result in findings of violations of laws orders rules or regulations as well as fines and penalties any of which could involve substantial costs and cause reputational damage in addition socalgas may incur higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures as a result of these investigations or new laws orders rules and regulations arising out of this incident or our responses thereto which may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates the occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect socalgas’ and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

natural gas storage operations and reliability 

in february 2017 the cpuc opened a proceeding pursuant to sb 380 oii to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region including considering alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility’s services if it were eliminated 

if the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value the facility could be impaired higher than expected operating costs could be incurred andor additional capital expenditures may be required any or all of which may not be recoverable in rates and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

insurance and estimated costs 

at december 31 2021 socalgas estimates certain costs related to the leak are 3221 million the cost estimate which includes the 1279 million of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance this cost estimate may increase significantly as more information becomes available a portion of the cost estimate has been paid and 1983 million is accrued as reserve for aliso canyon costs at december 31 2021 on socalgas’ and sempra’s consolidated balance sheets 

the civil litigation against us related to the leak seeks compensatory statutory and punitive damages restitution and civil and administrative fines penalties and other costs we also could be subject to damages fines or other penalties as a result of the pending regulatory investigations and other matters related to the leak except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain legal and regulatory matters as described above the cost estimate does not include litigation regulatory proceedings or other matters to the extent it is not possible to predict at this time the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the possible costs or a range of possible costs for damages restitution civil or administrative fines or penalties defense settlement or other costs or remedies that may be imposed or incurred the cost estimate also does not include certain other costs incurred by sempra associated with defending against shareholder derivative lawsuits and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate further we are not able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued these costs or losses not included in the cost estimate could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

we have received insurance payments for many of the categories of costs included in the cost estimate and we intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for the costs we have incurred other than insurance for certain future defense costs we may incur as well as directors’ and officers’ liability we have exhausted all of our insurance in this matter we continue to pursue other sources of insurance coverage for costs related to this matter but we may not be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for any of these costs if we are not able to secure additional insurance recovery if any costs we have recorded as an insurance receivable are not collected if there are delays in receiving insurance recoveries or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible such amounts which could be significant could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

any failure by the cpuc to adequately reform sdge’s rate structure could have a material adverse effect on sdge and sempra 

the nem program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of onsite renewable generation primarily solar installations for residential and business customers under the current mechanism nem customers receive a full retail rate for energy they generate but do not use that is fed to the utility’s power grid which results in these customers not paying their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system subject to certain exceptions but still receiving electricity from the system when their selfgeneration is inadequate to meet their electricity needs as more and higher electricuse customers switch to nem and selfgenerate energy the burden on remaining nonnem customers who effectively subsidize the unpaid nem costs increases which in turn encourages more selfgeneration and further increases rate pressure on remaining nonnem customers 

table of c ontents 

the current electric residential rate structure in california is primarily based on consumption volume which places a higher rate burden on customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers as of december 31 2021 the cpuc has declined to adopt a fixed charge independent of consumption volume for residential customers however it has advised the utilities to renew their requests for a fixed charge at a later date if such proposals include an adequate customer outreach and communications plan in august 2020 the cpuc initiated a rulemaking to further develop a successor to the existing nem tariff in december 2021 a proposed decision was issued recommending substantial reform of the nem program through the establishment of a new net billing tariff that would apply to new net metered customers the new net billing tariff is intended to provide for the payment by new net metered customers of their proportionate share of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system which if the proposed decision is adopted should reduce the costshifting burden from new net metered customers to nonnem customers the timing of the final decision is uncertain depending on the structure and functionality of the net billing tariff which is uncertain the risks associated with the existing nem tariff could continue or increase 

sdge believes the establishment of a charge independent of consumption volume for residential customers is critical to help distribute rates among all customers that rely on the electric transmission and distribution system including those participating in the nem program the absence of a charge independent of consumption volume coupled with the continuing increase of solar installation and other forms of selfgeneration as well as the progression of distributed energy resources and energy efficiency initiatives that could also reduce delivered volumes could adversely impact electricity rates and the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system any such impact could subject sdge to increased customer dissatisfaction increased likelihood of noncompliance with cpuc or other safety or operational standards and increased risks attendant to any such noncompliance as we discuss above as well as increased costs including power procurement operating and capital costs and potential disallowance of recovery for these costs 

if the cpuc fails to adequately reform sdge’s rate structure to better achieve reasonable costbased electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system such failure could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

risks related to sempra texas utilities 

operational and structural risks 

certain ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management operations and policies of oncor 

various “ringfencing” measures governance mechanisms and commitments are in place that create legal and financial separation between oncor holdings oncor and their subsidiaries on the one hand and sempra and its affiliates and subsidiaries on the other hand these measures are designed to enhance oncor’s separateness from its owners and mitigate the risk that oncor would be negatively impacted by a bankruptcy or other adverse financial development affecting its owners these measures subject us and oncor to various restrictions including 

▪ seven members of oncor’s 13person board of directors must be independent directors in all material respects under the rules of the nyse in relation to sempra and its affiliates and any other owners of oncor and also must have no material relationship with sempra or its affiliates or any other owners of oncor currently or within the previous 10 years of the six remaining directors two must be designated by sempra two must be designated by oncor’s minority owner tti and two must be current or former oncor officers 

▪ oncor will not pay dividends or other distributions except for contractual tax payments if a majority of its independent directors or any of the directors appointed by tti determines that it is in the best interest of oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements 

▪ oncor will not pay dividends or other distributions except for contractual tax payments if that payment would cause its debttoequity ratio to exceed the debttoequity ratio approved by the puct 

▪ if oncor’s senior secured debt credit rating by any of the rating agencies falls below bbb or baa2 for moody’s oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions except for contractual tax payments unless otherwise allowed by the puct 

▪ there must be certain “separateness measures” maintained to reinforce the legal and financial separation of oncor from sempra including a requirement that dealings between oncor and sempra or sempra’s affiliates other than oncor holdings and its subsidiaries must be on an arm’slength basis limitations on affiliate transactions and a prohibition on pledging oncor assets or stock for any entity other than oncor 

table of c ontents 

▪ a majority of oncor’s independent directors and the directors designated by tti that are present and voting with at least one required to be present and voting must approve any annual or multiyear budget if the aggregate amount of capital expenditures or om in such budget is more than a 10 increase or decrease from the corresponding amounts in the budget for the preceding fiscal year or multiyear period as applicable 

▪ sempra must continue to hold indirectly at least 51 of the ownership interests in oncor holdings and oncor until at least march 9 2023 unless otherwise authorized by the puct 

as a result of these measures we do not control oncor holdings or oncor and we have limited ability to direct the management policies and operations of oncor holdings and oncor including the deployment or disposition of their assets declarations of dividends strategic planning and other important corporate matters we have limited representation on the oncor holdings and oncor boards of directors which are each controlled by independent directors moreover all directors of oncor including the directors we have appointed have considerable autonomy and have a duty to act in the best interest of oncor consistent with the approved ringfence and delaware law which may in certain cases be contrary to our interests to the extent the directors approve or oncor otherwise pursues actions that are not in our interests our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects may be materially adversely affected 

industryrelated risks 

changes in the regulation or operation of the electric utility industry andor the ercot market could materially adversely affect oncor which could materially adversely affect us 

oncor operates in the electric utility industry and as a result it is subject to many of the same or similar risks as sempra california as we describe above under “risks related to sempra california” in particular the costs and burdens associated with complying with the various legislative and regulatory requirements to which oncor is subject at the federal state and local levels and adjusting oncor’s business and operations in response to legislative and regulatory developments including changes in ercot and any fines or penalties that could result from any noncompliance may have a material adverse effect on oncor in addition oncor operates in the ercot market and as a result any economic weakness or reduced electricity demand in ercot could materially adversely affect oncor moreover legislative regulatory market or industry activities could adversely impact oncor’s collections and cash flows and jeopardize the predictability of utility earnings including temporary measures such as the approximately fourmonth long moratorium on customer disconnections due to nonpayment that was in place following an extreme winter weather event and resulting power outages in february 2021 other actions taken by governmental authorities customers or other third parties to address financial challenges following this event or other similar events legislation affecting the ercot market to address issues with its operation during this event or other similar events or to improve grid reliability generally or the growth of thirdparty distributed energy resources and other technologies that may increasingly compete with oncor’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers if oncor does not successfully respond to any such changes applicable to it oncor could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

financial risks 

oncor’s operations are capitalintensive and it could have liquidity needs that necessitate additional investments 

oncor’s business is capitalintensive and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements in the past oncor has financed much of its cash needs from operations and with proceeds from indebtedness but these sources of capital may not be adequate or available in the future because our commitments to the puct prohibit us from making loans to oncor we may elect to make additional capital contributions if oncor fails to meet its capital requirements or is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs any such investments could be substantial would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes and could increase our indebtedness any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects

in connection with the signing and closing of the merger of efh with an indirect subsidiary of sempra the merger efh sought and received a supplemental private letter ruling from the irs and sempra and efh received tax opinions from their respective counsels that generally provide that the merger will not affect the conclusions reached in respectively the irs private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spinoff described above similar to the irs private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spinoff the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs and any opinions issued with respect to the merger are based on factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by sempra and efh now sempra texas holdings corp and a subsidiary of sempra if such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete any such undertakings are not complied with or the facts upon which the irs supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions which will not impact the irs position on the transactions are based are different from the actual facts relating to the merger the tax opinions andor supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and could be challenged by the irs even though sempra texas holdings corp would have administrative appeal rights if the irs were to invalidate its private letter ruling andor supplemental private letter ruling including the right to challenge any adverse irs position in court any such appeal would be subject to uncertainties and could fail if it is ultimately determined that the merger caused the spinoff not to qualify for the intended tax treatment sempra through its ownership of sempra texas holdings corp could incur substantial tax liabilities which would materially reduce and potentially eliminate the value associated with our indirect investment in oncor and could have a material adverse effect on sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects and the market value of its common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

risks related to sempra infrastructure 

operational risks 

project development activities may not be successful projects under construction may not be completed on schedule or within budget and completed projects may not operate at expected levels any of which could materially adversely affect us 

all energy infrastructure projects 

we are involved in a number of energy infrastructure projects which subject us to numerous risks success in developing such a project is contingent upon among other things 

▪ our financial condition and cash flows and other factors that impact our ability to invest sufficient funds into the project including for preliminary matters that may need to be accomplished before we can determine whether the project is feasible or economically attractive 

▪ project assessment and design and our ability to foresee and incorporate new and developing trends and technologies in the energy industry such as our pursuit of projects and design solutions to help enable our and our customers’ climate goals 

▪ our ability to reach a final investment decision or meet other milestones which may be influenced by external factors outside our control including the global economy and energy and financial markets actions by regulators achieving necessary internal and external approvals including as applicable by all project partners and many of the other factors described in this risk factor 

▪ negotiation of satisfactory epc agreements including any renegotiation that may be required in the event of delays in final investment decisions or other failures to meet specified deadlines 

▪ progressing relationships from mous or similar arrangements which are nonbinding and generally do not impose obligations on any of the parties to execution of definitive agreements and participation in the project 

▪ identification of suitable partners customers suppliers and other necessary counterparties negotiation of satisfactory equity purchase sale supply transportation and other appropriate commercial agreements and satisfaction of any conditions to effectiveness of such agreements including reaching a final investment decision within agreed timelines 

▪ timely receipt and maintenance of required governmental permits licenses and other authorizations that do not impose material conditions and are otherwise granted under terms we find reasonable 

▪ our project partners’ contractors’ and other counterparties’ willingness and financial or other ability to make their required investments or fulfill their contractual commitments on a timely basis 

▪ timely satisfactory and onbudget completion of construction which could be negatively affected by engineering problems work stoppages equipment unavailability contractor performance and a variety of other factors many of which we discuss above under “risks related to all sempra businesses – operational risks” and elsewhere in this risk factor 

table of c ontents 

▪ implementation of new or changes to existing laws or regulations that impact our infrastructure or the energy sector generally 

▪ obtaining adequate and reasonably priced financing for the project 

▪ the absence of hidden defects or inherited environmental liabilities for any project construction 

▪ fast and costeffective resolution of any litigation or unsettled property rights affecting the project 

▪ geopolitical events and other uncertainties such as the conflict in ukraine 

any failures with respect to the above factors or other factors material to any particular project could involve additional costs and otherwise negatively affect our ability to successfully complete the project and force us to impair or write off amounts we have invested in the project if we are unable to complete a development project if we experience delays or if construction financing or other project costs exceed our estimated budgets and we are required to make additional capital contributions we may never recover or receive an adequate or any return on our investment and other resources invested in the project and our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected 

the operation of existing facilities and any future projects we are able to complete involves many risks including the potential for unforeseen design flaws engineering challenges equipment failures or the breakdown for other reasons of facilities equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption environmental contamination and the other operational risks that we discuss above under “risks related to all sempra businesses – operational risks” any of these events could lead to our facilities being idle for an extended period of time or our facilities operating below expected levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

lng export projects 

in addition to the risks described above that are applicable to all our energy infrastructure projects we are exposed to additional risks in connection with our lng export projects including the eca lng phase 1 project under construction and our potential development of additional lng export facilities we discuss our lng export projects in “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – sempra infrastructure” each of these projects faces numerous risks our ability to reach a final investment decision for each project and if such a decision is reached and a project is completed the overall success of the project are dependent on global energy markets including natural gas and oil supply demand and pricing in general depressed natural gas and lng prices in the markets we intend to serve due to shifts in supply or other factors could reduce the pricing and cost advantages of exporting domestically produced natural gas and lng which could lead to decreased demand in addition global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections could reduce demand for natural gas and lng in some sectors a reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation or as a result of calls by some to limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source globally oil prices could also make lng projects in other parts of the world more feasible and competitive with lng projects in north america thus increasing supply and competition for any available lng demand any of these developments could impact competition and prospects for developing lng export projects and negatively affect the performance and prospects of any of our projects that are or become operational 

our proposed projects may face distinct disadvantages relative to some other lng projects under construction or in development by other project developers including 

▪ the proposed expansion of the cameron lng jv facility phase 2 is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the financing agreements for phase 1 of the project and requires unanimous consent of all jv partners including with respect to the equity investment obligations of each partner we may not be able to satisfy these conditions and requirements in which case our ability to develop the phase 2 project would be jeopardized 

▪ our port arthur texas project is a greenfield site and therefore is subject to disadvantages relative to brownfield sites including increased time and costs to develop and construct the project 

▪ the eca lng projects are subject to ongoing land and permit disputes that could obstruct efforts to find or maintain suitable partners customers and financing arrangements and hinder or halt construction and if the projects are completed operations we discuss these risks below and under “risks related to sempra infrastructure – legal risks” in addition the mexican regulatory process and overlay of us regulations for natural gas exports to lng facilities in mexico are not well developed which among other factors contributed to delays obtaining a necessary permit from the mexican government and reaching a final investment decision for the eca lng phase 1 project and could cause similar delays or other hurdles in the future and lead to difficulties finding or maintaining suitable partners customers and financing arrangements we have entered into contracts with affiliates and third parties subject to certain conditions to supply and transport gas to and across the usmexico border to meet the requirements of the eca lng phase 1 project if and when it becomes operational if affiliates or third parties experience any delays or fail to obtain and maintain necessary permits and arrangements to provide such supply or transportation service or if we fail to maintain adequate gas supply and transportation agreements to support the project fully it 

table of c ontents 

could cause additional costs or delays to the eca lng phase 1 project finally although we have planned measures to not disrupt operations at the eca regas facility with the construction or operation of the eca lng phase 1 project we expect construction of the proposed eca lng phase 2 project would conflict with eca regas facility operations making the decision on whether and how to pursue the eca lng phase 2 project dependent in part on whether the investment in this largescale liquefaction export facility would over the long term be more beneficial than continuing to provide regasification services under existing contracts for 100 of the eca regas facility’s capacity through 2028 

development of additional trains and liquefaction facilities will depend on the ability of our existing pipeline interconnections to be expanded or the ability to permit and construct new pipeline facilities each of which may require us to enter into additional pipeline interconnection agreements with thirdparty pipelines we and third parties may not be able to successfully develop and construct such new pipeline facilities or we may not be able to secure such additional pipeline interconnections on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the capital requirements for natural gas liquefaction and lng export projects that we have decided or may in the future decide to proceed with can be significant in addition our proposed facilities may not be completed in accordance with estimated timelines or budgets or at all as a result of the above or other factors and delays cost overruns or our inability to complete one or more of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

financing arrangements 

we may become involved in various financing arrangements with respect to any of our energy infrastructure projects such as guarantees indemnities or loans these arrangements could expose us to additional risks including exposure to losses upon the occurrence of certain events related to the development construction operation or financing of the applicable projects that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

we are dependent on the equipment provided by third parties to operate cameron lng jv’s phase 1 project and the failure of such equipment may adversely impact our business and performance 

cameron lng jv has experienced operating issues with equipment provided by certain thirdparty vendors which have caused reductions in operating capacity and the declaration of force majeure events by cameron lng jv under its tolling agreements certain of cameron lng jv’s customers have raised objections regarding these force majeure declarations and cameron lng jv’s customers may raise objections in the future regarding these declarations or other force majeure declarations for similar operating issues cameron lng jv’s customers have rights under their tolling agreements to obtain certain future quantities of excess lng production in connection with these and certain other force majeure events and future force majeure events may also lead to the additional accrual of similar rights the requirement to deliver excess lng production to these customers in connection with these force majeure events has had and in the future could have an adverse impact to sempra infrastructure’s and our business and cash flows as cameron lng jv loses fees related to the excess production 

these and other operational issues arising from equipment or facilities provided by thirdparty vendors may require us to undertake remediation repair or equipment replacement activities in the future that could result in reductions or cessations in production from our facilities although we are seeking to enforce warranty and other claims against our epc contractors and other equipment vendors and suppliers we may face challenges in successfully enforcing these claims against these third parties any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

hydraulic fracturing is subject to political economic and other uncertainties 

domestic and international hydraulic fracturing operations face political and economic risks and uncertainties several states have imposed or are considering imposing more stringent permitting public disclosure and well construction requirements and some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions that may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general andor hydraulic fracturing in particular we cannot predict whether additional federal state local or international laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit the current us administration may have a negative view of hydraulic fracturing which could increase the risk of regulation that negatively affects these operations if additional regulation or permitting requirements are imposed on domestic hydraulic fracturing operations natural gas prices in north america could rise and the relative pricing advantage in favor of domestic natural gas could decline which could materially adversely affect demand for lng exports and our ability to develop commercially viable lng export facilities beyond cameron lng jv phase 1 and eca lng phase 1 which are fully contracted any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

table of c ontents 

fixedprice longterm contracts for services or commodities expose our businesses to inflationary pressures 

sempra infrastructure seeks to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities in an effort to optimize the use of its facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure if these contracts are at fixed prices their profitability may be negatively affected by inflationary pressures including increased labor materials equipment commodities and other operational costs rising interest rates that affect financing costs and changes in applicable exchange rates we may try to mitigate these risks by among other things using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating and providing for cost escalation when bidding on projects contracting for direct passthrough of operating costs andor entering into hedges however these measures may not fully or substantially offset any increases in operating expenses or financing costs caused by inflationary pressures and their use could introduce additional risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

increased competition could materially adversely affect us 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors many of whom have extensive and diversified development andor operating experience domestically and internationally and financial resources similar to or greater than ours in particular the natural gas pipeline storage and lng market segments recently have been characterized by strong and increasing competition for winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets in addition our mexican natural gas distribution business faces increased competition now that its former exclusivity period with respect to its distribution zones has expired and other distributors are legally permitted to build and operate natural gas distribution systems and compete to attract customers in the locations where it operates these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

we may not be able to enter into maintain extend or replace longterm supply sales or capacity agreements 

the eca regas facility has longterm capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties and also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified for sale to other parties in addition cameron lng jv has longterm liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements with three counterparties that collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of its phase 1 facility the longterm nature of these agreements and the small number of customers at each of these facilities exposes us to risks including increased risk if these counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis increased credit risks and risks associated with the longterm nature of our relationships with these counterparties we are currently engaged in a legal dispute with the two thirdparty capacity customers shell mexico and gazprom at the eca regas facility involving breach of contract claims a constitutional challenge of the cre’s approval of the general terms and conditions for service at the facility and proceedings seeking to modify or revoke certain material permits needed by the facility and the proposed eca lng projects we discuss this dispute in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements these challenges and proceedings or any similar or other issues that arise with respect to these or our other longterm contracts including the conflict in ukraine could lead to significant legal and other costs result in cancelation of certain key contracts or otherwise adversely affect our relationships with longterm customers suppliers or partners and could negatively impact the reliability of revenues from the applicable projects and the prospects for any implicated development projects any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

sempra infrastructure’s ability to enter into new or replace existing longterm capacity agreements for its natural gas pipeline operations is dependent on among other factors demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from its transportation customers which may include our lng export facilities a decrease in demand for or supply of lng or natural gas from such customers or the occurrence of other events that hinder sempra infrastructure from maintaining such agreements or establishing new ones could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive as more plants are built supplies of energy and related products may exceed demand competitive pressures may increase and wholesale electricity prices may decline or become more volatile without longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased volatility and we may be unable to sell the power that sempra infrastructure’s facilities are capable of producing or sell it at favorable prices any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

our businesses depend on the performance of counterparties and any performance failures by these counterparties could materially adversely affect us 

our businesses depend on business partners customers suppliers and other counterparties who owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm arrangements to perform their obligations in accordance with such arrangements should they fail to perform we may need to enter into alternative arrangements or honor our underlying commitments at then 

table of c ontents 

current market prices which may result in additional losses to us to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties any efforts to enforce the terms of these arrangements through legal or other means could involve significant time and costs and would be unpredictable and may not be successful in addition many such arrangements including our relationships with the applicable counterparties are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses we also may not be able to secure replacement agreements with other partners customers or suppliers at all or on terms at least as favorable to the original terms if any of these agreements terminate further we often extend credit to customers and other counterparties and although we perform credit analyses prior to extending credit we may not be able to collect the amounts owed to us which presents an increased risk for our longterm supply sales and capacity contracts the failure of any of our counterparties to perform in accordance with their arrangements with us could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

sempra infrastructure’s obligations and those of its lng suppliers are contractually subject to suspension or termination for “force majeure” events which generally are beyond the control of the parties and limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages that may prohibit recovery of all costs incurred for any breach of an agreement any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

sempra infrastructure engages in jvs and invests in companies in which other equity partners may have or share with us control over the applicable project or investment we discuss the risks related to these arrangements above under “risks related to sempra – operational and structural risks” 

we rely on transportation assets and services much of which we do not own or control to deliver natural gas and electricity 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and services owned and operated by third parties to among other things 

▪ deliver the natural gas lng electricity and lpg we sell to customers or use for our natural gas liquefaction export facilities 

▪ supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities 

▪ provide retail energy services to customers 

if transportation is disrupted if the construction of new or modified interconnecting infrastructure is not completed on schedule or if capacity is inadequate we may not be able to move forward with our projects on schedule we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities electricity and other services to our customers we may be responsible for damages incurred by these customers such as the cost of acquiring alternative supplies at thencurrent spot market rates and we could lose customers that may be difficult to replace in competitive market conditions any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

financial risks 

our international businesses and operations expose us to foreign currency and inflation risks 

our operations in mexico pose foreign currency and inflation risks exchange and inflation rates with respect to the mexican peso and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on the revenue costs and cash flows from our international operations which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we may attempt to hedge crosscurrency transactions and earnings exposure through various means including financial instruments and shortterm investments but these hedges may not successfully achieve our objectives of mitigating earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries we are susceptible to volatility in oci caused by exchange rate fluctuations for entities whose functional currencies are not the us dollar moreover mexico has experienced periods of high inflation and exchange rate instability in the past and severe devaluation of the mexican peso could result in governmental intervention to institute restrictive exchange control policies as has occurred before in mexico and other latin american countries we discuss our foreign currency exposure at our mexican subsidiaries in “part ii – item 7 mda” and “part ii – item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

our businesses are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices that could materially adversely affect us 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for pipeline operations lng facilities or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers the regional and other markets in which we purchase these commodities are competitive and can be subject to significant pricing volatility as a result of many factors including adverse weather conditions supply and demand changes availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources commodity production levels and storage 

table of c ontents 

capacity energy and environmental legislation and regulations and economic and financial market conditions our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas lng electricity or other commodities we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we have not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions 

legal and regulatory risks 

our international businesses and operations expose us to increased legal regulatory tax economic geopolitical and management oversight risks and challenges 

overview 

we own or have interests in a variety of energy infrastructure assets in mexico and we do business with companies based in foreign markets including particularly our lng export operations conducting these activities in foreign jurisdictions subjects us to complex management security political legal economic and financial risks that vary by country many of which may differ from and potentially be greater than those associated with our wholly domestic businesses and the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects these risks include the following and the other risks discussed in this risk factor below 

▪ tax trade environmental and other foreign laws and regulations and compliance with them including legal limitations on ownership in some foreign countries and inadequate or inconsistent enforcement of regulations 

▪ actions by local regulatory bodies including setting rates and tariffs that may be earned by or charged to our businesses 

▪ adverse changes in social political economic or market conditions or the stability of foreign governments 

▪ adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals challenges to or difficulty obtaining maintaining and complying with permits or approvals difficulty enforcing contractual and property rights differing legal standards for lawsuits or other proceedings and unsettled property rights and titles in mexico 

▪ expropriation or theft of assets 

▪ with respect to our nonutility international business activities changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers which may be driven by many of the factors listed above among others 

mexican government influence on economic and energy matters 

the mexican government has exercised and continues to exercise significant and increasing influence over the mexican economy and energy sector and is proposing additional changes that in each case could fundamentally impact private investment in this sector 

with respect to the electricity market the mexican legislature is currently considering proposed constitutional reform that would among other things make the cfe the only entity allowed to commercialize electric energy in mexico thereby eliminating the wholesale electricity market entirely this reform would also limit the overall capacity and types of plants eligible to generate electricity for the cfe to commercialize resulting in the cancelation of electricity generation permits and contracts for the sale of electricity to the cfe including permits at all of sempra infrastructure’s operational power generation facilities recent mexican governmental actions in the electricity market also include resolutions orders decrees regulations and proposed amendments to mexican law that could among other things threaten the prospects for privateparty renewable energy generation in the country limit the ability to dispatch renewable energy and receive or maintain operational permits and increase costs of electricity for legacy renewables and cogeneration energy contract holders 

with respect to midstream and downstream activities recent governmental actions include amendments in june october and november of 2021 to mexico’s general foreign trade rules that establish additional requirements for obtaining authorizations for the import and export of hydrocarbons refined products petrochemicals and biofuels through channels other than those authorized lda authorizations the eca regas facility and the veracruz terminal have lda authorizations that are valid through 2023 although the ability to subsequently renew these authorizations may be limited by these amended rules we are assessing the effect of these amended rules on our operations and development of future projects including those in the vicinity of topolobampo manzanillo and ensenada as well as the proposed eca lng liquefaction projects in addition amendments to mexico’s hydrocarbons law that give sener and the cre additional powers to suspend and revoke permits were published in may 2021 while the courts have enjoined enforcement of these amendments pending a final disposition in the case of several of our projects the amendments provide that suspension of permits will be determined by sener or the cre when a danger to national security energy security or the national economy is foreseen and also provide new grounds for the revocation of permits under certain circumstances additionally in the case of existing permits the amendments direct authorities to revoke permits that 

table of c ontents 

fail to comply with the minimum storage requirements established by sener or fail to comply with requirements or violate provisions established by the amended hydrocarbons law 

finally as part of an industrywide audit and investigative process initiated by the cre to enforce fuel procurement laws federal prosecutors conducted inspections at several refined products terminals including sempra infrastructure’s refined products terminal in puebla to confirm that the gasoline andor diesel in storage were legally imported during the inspection of the puebla terminal in september 2021 a federal prosecutor took samples from all the train and storage tanks in the terminal and ordered that the facility be temporarily shut down during the pendency of the analysis of the samples and investigation while leaving the terminal in sempra infrastructure’s custody in addition in november 2021 the cre notified sempra infrastructure of the commencement of an administrative proceeding for revoking the storage permit at the puebla terminal due to alleged breach of its terms and conditions we cannot predict when the investigation will be completed the outcome of the administrative proceeding or whether andor when the facility will be able to commence commercial operations 

we discuss these mexican governmental actions further in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot predict whether proposed changes like the constitutional reform to the electricity market or other similar governmental actions will ultimately be passed or otherwise become effective in their current forms nor can we predict the nature or level of impact of this constitutional reform on nonelectric segments of the energy sector we also cannot predict whether actions to enjoin enforcement or suspend or overturn existing laws and other governmental actions will be successful more generally we cannot predict the impact that the political social and judicial landscape in mexico will have on that country’s economy and energy sector and our business in mexico if any of the recent mexican governmental actions are passed or otherwise become effective if efforts to enjoin their enforcement or suspend or overturn them fail or if other similar moves by the mexican government are taken to curb privateparty participation in the energy sector including the passage of additional laws or regulations or increased investigative and enforcement activities this could materially impact our ability to operate our facilities at existing levels or at all may result in increased costs for sempra infrastructure and its customers may adversely affect our ability to develop new projects and may negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying values of our investments in mexico any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

us and mexican laws and foreign policy including trade and related matters 

our international business activities are subject to us and mexican laws and regulations related to foreign operations or doing business internationally including the us foreign corrupt practices act the mexican federal anticorruption law in public contracting ley federal anticorrupción en contrataciones públicas and similar laws and are sensitive to us and mexican foreign policy trade policy and other geopolitical factors the current and the last us administrations have taken different stances with respect to international trade agreements tariffs immigration policy and other matters of foreign policy that impact trade and foreign relations shifts in foreign policy could increase the adverse effects on our businesses and create uncertainty making it difficult to predict the impact these policies could have on our businesses violations or alleged violations of the laws referred to above as well as foreign policy positions that adversely affect imports and exports between the us mexican and other economies and foreign companies with whom we conduct business could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

our businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits and our properties in mexico could be subject to expropriation by the mexican government 

we are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the property in mexico where our eca regas facility is situated and our proposed eca lng projects are expected to be situated which we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in addition we may have or seek to obtain longterm leases or rightsofway from governmental agencies or other third parties to operate our energy infrastructure located on land we do not own for a specific period of time if we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties we own or if we are unable to obtain or retain rights to construct and operate on the properties we do not own on reasonable financial and other terms we could lose our rights to occupy and use these properties and the related facilities which could delay or derail proposed projects increase our development costs and result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts related to the affected facilities that could lead to legal costs fines or penalties in addition disputes regarding any of these properties could lead to difficulties finding or maintaining suitable partners customers and project financing arrangements and could hinder or halt our ability to construct and if completed operate the affected facilities or proposed projects any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

table of c ontents 

sempra infrastructure’s energy infrastructure assets may be considered by the mexican government to be a public service or essential for the provision of a public service in which case these assets and the related businesses could be subject to expropriation or nationalization loss of concessions renegotiation or annulment of existing contracts and other similar risks any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects

significant changes in revenues costs and earnings 

this section contains a discussion of the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of operations for sempra sdge and socalgas 

utilities revenues and cost of sales 

our utilities revenues include natural gas revenues at socalgas and sdge and sempra infrastructure’s ecogas and electric revenues at sdge intercompany revenues included in the separate revenues of each utility are eliminated in sempra’s consolidated statements of operations 

socalgas and sdge currently operate under a regulatory framework that permits 

▪ the cost of natural gas purchased for core customers primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers to be passed through to customers in rates substantially as incurred socalgas’ gcim provides socalgas the opportunity to share in the savings andor costs from buying natural gas for its core customers at prices below or above monthly marketbased benchmarks this mechanism permits full recovery of costs incurred when average purchase costs are within a price range around the benchmark price any higher costs incurred or savings realized outside this range are shared between the core customers and socalgas 

▪ sdge to recover the actual cost incurred to generate or procure electricity based on annual estimates of the cost of electricity supplied to customers the differences in cost between estimates and actual are recovered or refunded in subsequent periods through rates 

▪ socalgas and sdge to recover certain program expenditures and other costs authorized by the cpuc or “refundable programs” 

because changes in socalgas’ and sdge’s cost of natural gas andor electricity are recovered in rates changes in these costs are offset in the changes in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings in addition to the changes in cost or market prices natural gas or electric revenues recorded during a period are impacted by the difference between customer billings and recorded or cpucauthorized amounts these differences are required to be balanced over time resulting in over and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts we discuss balancing accounts and their effects further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report

as part of our central risk management function we may enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge si partners’ exposure to movements in the mexican peso from its controlling interest in ienova the gainslosses associated with these derivatives are included in other income expense net as described below and partially mitigate the transactional effects of foreign currency and inflation included in income tax expense benefit for si partners’ consolidated entities and in equity earnings for si partners’ equity method investments we also utilized foreign currency derivatives in 2020 and 2019 to hedge exposure to fluctuations in the peruvian sol and chilean peso related to the sales of our operations in peru and chile respectively we discuss policies governing our risk management below in “part ii – item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

other income net was 58 million in 2021 compared to other expense net of 48 million in 2020 the change was primarily due to 

▪ 46 million lower net losses in 2021 from impacts associated with interest rate and foreign exchange instruments and foreign currency transactions primarily due to 

◦ 36 million lower losses on foreign currency derivatives and crosscurrency swaps as a result of fluctuation of the mexican peso and 

◦ 19 million lower foreign currency losses on a mexican pesodenominated loan to img jv which is offset in equity earnings offset by 

◦ 11 million lower net gains in 2021 on other foreign currency transactional effects

other expense net was 48 million in 2020 compared to other income net of 77 million in 2019 the change was primarily due to 

▪ 92 million net losses in 2020 from interest rate and foreign exchange instruments and foreign currency transactions compared to net gains of 55 million in 2019 primarily due to

1   we discuss how we recognize equity earnings in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sempra 

sempra’s income tax expense decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to

▪ 10 million income tax benefit in 2019 from a reduction in a valuation allowance against certain nol carryforwards as a result of our decision to sell our south american businesses 

we report as part of our pretax results the income or loss attributable to nci however we do not record income taxes for a portion of this income or loss as some of our entities with nci are currently treated as partnerships for income tax purposes and 

table of c ontents 

thus we are only liable for income taxes on the portion of the earnings that are allocated to us our pretax income however includes 100 of these entities if our entities with nci grow and if we continue to invest in such entities the impact on our etr may become more significant 

we discuss the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and inflation on income taxes below in “impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations” see notes 1 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details about our accounting for income taxes and items subject to flowthrough treatment 

sdge 

sdge’s income tax expense increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower income tax benefits in 2021 from flowthrough items

socalgas 

socalgas’ income tax benefit in 2021 compared to an income tax expense in 2020 was primarily due to

equity earnings 

equity earnings increased by 328 million 32 to 13 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to 

▪ 50 million equity earnings in 2021 compared to 100 million equity losses in 2020 related to our investment in rbs sempra commodities to settle pending vat matters and related legal costs and 

▪ 136 million higher equity earnings at sempra infrastructure which included 

◦ 168 million higher equity earnings at cameron lng jv primarily due to the threetrain liquefaction project achieving full commercial operations in august 2020 offset by 

◦ 20 million lower equity earnings at img jv primarily due to foreign currency effects including 19 million lower foreign currency gains on img jv’s mexican pesodenominated loans from its jv owners which is fully offset in other income expense net and 

◦ 9 million lower equity earnings at tag jv primarily due to higher income tax expense in 2021 and 

▪ 40 million higher equity earnings at oncor holdings primarily due to increased revenues from rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital and customer growth offset by increased operating costs and expenses attributable to invested capital 

equity earnings increased by 435 million to 10 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

▪ 487 million higher equity earnings at sempra infrastructure which included 

◦ 367 million higher equity earnings from cameron lng jv primarily due to the threetrain liquefaction project achieving full commercial operations in august 2020 

◦ 94 million higher equity earnings at img jv primarily due to higher revenues from the start of commercial operations of the sur de texastuxpan marine pipeline and foreign currency effects including 42 million foreign currency gains in 2020 compared to 30 million foreign currency losses in 2019 on img jv’s mexican pesodenominated loans from its jv owners which is fully offset in other expense income net offset by lower afudc equity and 

◦ 23 million higher equity earnings at tag jv primarily due to lower income tax expense in 2020 and 

table of c ontents

▪ 100 million equity losses in 2020 related to our investment in rbs sempra commodities to settle pending vat matters and related legal costs 

earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

earnings attributable to nci were 145 million for 2021 compared to 172 million for 2020 the decrease of 27 million 16 was primarily due to 

▪ 87 million decrease from the increase in our ownership interest in ienova as a result of the exchange offer and subsequent cash tender offer to acquire the publicly owned shares of ienova and 

▪ 28 million decrease mainly from foreign currency and inflation effects and associated derivatives offset by 

▪ 98 million increase due to the increase in nci as a result of the sale of a 20 nci in si partners to kkr in october 2021 

earnings attributable to nci were 172 million for 2020 compared to 164 million for 2019 the net change of 8 million 5 was primarily due to an increase at sempra infrastructure mainly from foreign currency effects as a result of fluctuation of the mexico peso offset by a decrease due to the sales of our peruvian businesses in april 2020 and chilean businesses in june 2020 

preferred dividends 

preferred dividends decreased by 105 million to 63 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the conversion of all series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock in january 2021 and july 2021 respectively offset by the issuance of series c preferred stock in june 2020 

preferred dividends increased by 26 million 18 to 168 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to dividends associated with our series c preferred stock which was issued in june 2020 

impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations 

because our natural gas distribution utility in mexico ecogas uses its local currency as its functional currency revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates for the period for consolidation in sempra’s results of operations prior to the sales of our south american businesses in 2020 our operations in south america used their local currency as their functional currency 

foreign currency translation 

any difference in average exchange rates used for the translation of income statement activity from year to year can cause a variance in sempra’s comparative results of operations changes in foreign currency translation rates between years were negligible in 2021 compared to 2020 and resulted in 9 million lower earnings in 2020 compared to 2019 

transactional impacts 

although the financial statements of most of our mexican subsidiaries and jvs have the us dollar as the functional currency some transactions may be denominated in the local currency such transactions are remeasured into us dollars this remeasurement creates transactional gains and losses that are included in other income expense net for our consolidated subsidiaries and in equity earnings for our jvs 

we utilize crosscurrency swaps that exchange our mexican pesodenominated principal and interest payments into the us dollar and swap mexican fixed interest rates for us fixed interest rates the impacts of these crosscurrency swaps are offset in oci and are reclassified from aoci into earnings through other income expense net and interest expense as settlements occur 

certain of our mexican pipelines namely los ramones i at ienova pipelines and los ramones norte at tag jv generate revenue based on tariffs that are set by government agencies in mexico with contracts denominated in mexican pesos that are indexed to the us dollar adjusted annually for inflation and fluctuation in the exchange rate the resultant gains and losses from remeasuring the local currency amounts into us dollars and the offsetting settlement of foreign currency forwards and swaps related to these contracts are included in revenues energyrelated businesses or equity earnings 

income statement activities at our foreign operations and their jvs are also impacted by transactional gains and losses a summary of which is shown in the table below 

table of c ontents 



foreign currency exchange rate and inflation impacts on income taxes and related hedging activity 

our mexican subsidiaries have us dollardenominated cash balances receivables payables and debt monetary assets and liabilities that are affected by mexican currency exchange rate movements for mexican income tax purposes they also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are significant denominated in the mexican peso that must be translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes in addition monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes as a result fluctuations in both the currency exchange rate for the mexican peso against the us dollar and mexican inflation may expose us to fluctuations in income tax expense other income expense net and equity earnings we may use foreign currency derivatives as a means to help manage exposure to the currency exchange rate on our monetary assets and liabilities and this derivative activity impacts other income expense net however we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities which makes us susceptible to volatility in income tax expense caused by exchange rate fluctuations and inflation 

we also utilized foreign currency derivatives in 2020 and 2019 to hedge exposure to fluctuations in the peruvian sol and chilean peso related to the sales of our operations in peru and chile in discontinued operations 



capital resources and liquidity 

overview 

sempra 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

our businesses that invest in develop and operate energy infrastructure and provide electric and gas services to customers have been identified as critical or essential services in the us and mexico and have continued to operate throughout the covid19 pandemic as our businesses continue to operate our priority is the safety of our employees customers partners and the communities we serve we and other companies including our partners are taking steps to try to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees and other stakeholders we continue to work closely with local state and federal authorities in an effort to provide essential services with minimum interruption to customers and in accordance with applicable orders including potential vaccination mandates 

for a further discussion of risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic see “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash requirements through cash flows from operations unrestricted cash and cash equivalents borrowings under our credit facilities issuances of debt distributions from our equity method investments project financing and funding from minority interest owners we believe that these cash flow sources combined with available funds will be adequate to fund our operations in both the shortterm and longterm including to 

table of c ontents 

▪ finance capital expenditures 

▪ repay longterm debt 

▪ fund dividends 

▪ meet liquidity requirements 

▪ fund capital contribution requirements 

▪ fund expenditures related to the natural gas leak at socalgas’ aliso canyon natural gas storage facility 

▪ repurchase shares of our common stock 

▪ fund new business or asset acquisitions or startups 

sempra sdge and socalgas currently have reasonable access to the money markets and capital markets and are not currently constrained in their ability to borrow money at reasonable rates from commercial banks under existing revolving credit facilities or through public offerings registered with the sec however our ability to access the money markets and capital markets or obtain credit from commercial banks outside of our committed revolving credit facilities could become materially constrained if changing economic conditions and disruptions to the money markets and capital markets worsen in addition our financing activities and actions by credit rating agencies as well as many other factors could negatively affect the availability and cost of both shortterm and longterm financing also cash flows from operations may be impacted by the timing of commencement and completion and potentially cost overruns of large projects and other material events such as significant outflows resulting from the agreements expected to resolve certain material litigation related to the leak if cash flows from operations were to be significantly reduced or we were unable to borrow under acceptable terms we would likely first reduce or postpone discretionary capital expenditures not related to safety and investments in new businesses we monitor our ability to finance the needs of our operating investing and financing activities in a manner consistent with our goal to maintain our investmentgrade credit ratings 

postretirement benefits 

sempra sdge and socalgas have significant investments in several trusts to provide for future payments of pensions and other postretirement benefits the trusts’ ability to make ongoing required benefit payments have not been materially adversely affected by changes in asset values which are dependent on market fluctuations contributions and withdrawals however changes in asset values or other factors in future periods such as changes to discount rates assumed rates of return mortality tables and regulations may impact funding requirements for pension and other postretirement benefits plans additionally contributions to our plans are based on our funding policy which generally limits payments from exceeding plan assets of 110 of the projected benefit obligation which are subject to maximum income tax deduction limitations sempra sdge and socalgas expect to contribute 236 million 53 million and 153 million respectively to pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2022 and 22 billion 393 million and 16 billion respectively in the nine years thereafter at sdge and socalgas funding requirements are generally recoverable in rates we discuss our employee benefit plans and our expected contributions to those plans in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

available funds 

our committed lines of credit provide liquidity and support commercial paper sempra sdge and socalgas each have fiveyear credit agreements expiring in 2024 si partners has a threeyear credit agreement expiring in 2024 and ienova has committed lines of credit that expire in 2023 and 2024 in addition ienova and eca lng phase 1 have uncommitted revolving credit facilities that expire in 2022 and 2023 



1 amounts at sempra include 205 held in nonus jurisdictions we discuss repatriation in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

2 available unused credit is the total available on the committed and uncommitted lines of credit that we discuss in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements because our commercial paper programs are supported by these lines we reflect the amount of commercial paper outstanding as a reduction to the available unused credit 

table of c ontents 

shortterm borrowings 

we use shortterm debt primarily to meet liquidity requirements fund shareholder dividends and temporarily finance capital expenditures acquisitions or startups sdge and socalgas use shortterm debt primarily to meet working capital needs revolving lines of credit commercial paper and a term loan at sdge were our primary sources of shortterm debt funding in 2021 

we discuss our shortterm debt activities in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and below in “sources and uses of cash” 

the following table shows selected statistics for our commercial paper borrowings 



longterm debt activities 

major issuances of and payments on longterm debt in 2021 included the following 



in december 2021 sempra redeemed at respective makewhole redemption prices an aggregate principal amount of 235 billion of senior unsecured notes prior to scheduled maturities in 2022 through 2025 upon the early redemptions we recognized 126 million 92 million after tax in charges associated with the makewhole premiums and a writeoff of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs 

in october 2021 sempra infrastructure used proceeds from borrowings against ienova’s committed and uncommitted lines of credit to fully repay 550 million of outstanding principal plus accrued and unpaid interest on the esj and ventika loans prior to their scheduled maturity dates through 2033 and recognized 54 million 30 million after tax and nci in charges associated with hedge termination costs and a writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs 

table of c ontents 

as we discuss in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on january 11 2022 si partners completed a private offering of 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 325 senior notes due january 15 2032 the notes were issued at 98903 of the principal amount and require semiannual interest payments in january and july commencing july 15 2022 sempra infrastructure intends to use the net proceeds of 390 million for general corporate purposes which may include the repayment of certain indebtedness of its subsidiaries 

on february 18 2022 sdge entered into a 400 million twoyear term loan with a maturity date of february 18 2024 sdge may request up to three borrowings for an aggregate amount of 400 million through may 18 2022 on february 18 2022 sdge borrowed 200 million the borrowing bears interest at benchmark rates plus 625 bps the margin is based on sdge’s longterm senior unsecured credit rating 

at december 31 2021 sempra expects to make interest payments on longterm debt totaling 157 billion of which 793 million is expected to be paid in 2022 and 149 billion is expected to be paid in subsequent years through 2079 at december 31 2021 sdge expects to make interest payments on longterm debt totaling 44 billion of which 244 million is expected to be paid in 2022 and 42 billion is expected to be paid in subsequent years through 2051 at december 31 2021 socalgas expects to make interest payments on longterm debt totaling 28 billion of which 167 million is expected to be paid in 2022 and 26 billion is expected to be paid in subsequent years through 2050 we calculate expected interest payments using the stated interest rate for fixedrate obligations including floatingtofixed interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps we calculate expected interest payments for variablerate obligations based on forecasted rates in effect at december 31 2021 

we discuss our longterm debt activities including the use of proceeds on longterm debt issuances and maturities in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

credit ratings 

the credit ratings of sempra sdge and socalgas remained at investment grade levels in 2021 



a downgrade of sempra’s or any of its subsidiaries’ credit ratings or rating outlooks may depending on the severity result in a requirement for collateral to be posted in the case of certain financing arrangements and may materially and adversely affect the market prices of their equity and debt securities the rates at which borrowings are made and commercial paper is issued and the various fees on their outstanding credit facilities this could make it more costly for sempra sdge socalgas and sempra’s other subsidiaries to issue debt securities to borrow under credit facilities and to raise certain other types of financing we provide additional information about our credit ratings at sempra sdge and socalgas in “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

sempra has agreed that if the credit rating of oncor’s senior secured debt by any of the three major rating agencies falls below bbb or the equivalent oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions except for contractual tax payments unless otherwise allowed by the puct oncor’s senior secured debt was rated a2 a and a at moody’s sp and fitch respectively at december 31 2021 

sempra sdge and socalgas have committed lines of credit to provide liquidity and to support commercial paper borrowings under these facilities bear interest at benchmark rates plus a margin that varies with market index rates and each borrower’s credit rating each facility also requires a commitment fee on available unused credit that may be impacted by each borrower’s credit rating for example assuming a onenotch downgrade 

▪ if sempra were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 25 bps the commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 5 bps 

▪ if sdge were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 125 bps the commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 5 bps 

▪ if socalgas were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 125 bps the commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 25 bps 

sempra’s sdge’s and socalgas’ credit ratings also may affect their respective credit limits related to derivative instruments as we discuss in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of c ontents 

loans tofrom affiliates 

at december 31 2021 sempra had 637 million in loans due from unconsolidated affiliates and 287 million in loans due to unconsolidated affiliates 

note receivable 

as we discuss in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in november 2021 sempra loaned 300 million to kkr in exchange for an interestbearing promissory note and reimbursed 5 million of loanrelated transaction costs incurred by kkr the promissory note is due to be repaid in full no later than october 1 2029 and bears compound interest at 5 per annum 

sempra california 

sdge’s and socalgas’ operations have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity their future performance and liquidity will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process environmental regulations economic conditions actions by the california legislature litigation and the changing energy marketplace as well as other matters described in this report sdge and socalgas expect that the available unused credit from their credit facilities described above cash flows from operations and debt issuances will continue to be adequate to fund their respective current operations and planned capital expenditures additionally as we discuss below sempra elected to make an equity contribution to socalgas in 2021 and may elect to make additional equity contributions in the future that are intended to maintain socalgas’ approved capital structure in connection with the accruals related to the leak we describe sdge’s and socalgas’ commitments related to construction projects operating and finance leases and purchase obligations related to the procurement of power and natural gas in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sdge and socalgas manage their capital structures and pay dividends when appropriate and as approved by their respective boards of directors 

as we discuss in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements changes in balancing accounts for significant costs at sdge and socalgas particularly a change between over and undercollected status may have a significant impact on cash flows these changes generally represent the difference between when costs are incurred and when they are ultimately recovered or refunded in rates through billings to customers 

covid19 pandemic protections 

sdge and socalgas are continuing to monitor the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on cash flows and results of operations some customers have experienced and continue to experience a diminished ability to pay their electric or gas bills leading to slower payments and higher levels of nonpayment than has been the case historically these impacts could become significant and could require modifications to our financing plans 

in connection with the covid19 pandemic and at the direction of the cpuc sdge and socalgas implemented certain measures to assist customers including suspending service disconnections due to nonpayment for all customers except for socalgas’ noncore customers waiving late payment fees and offering flexible payment plans at the cpuc’s direction sdge and socalgas are automatically enrolling residential and small business customers with pastdue balances in longterm repayment plans 

in 2021 sdge and socalgas applied on behalf of their customers for financial assistance from the california department of community services and development under the california arrearage payment program which provided funds of 63 million and 79 million for sdge and socalgas respectively in the first quarter of 2022 sdge and socalgas received and will apply the amounts directly to eligible customer accounts to reduce past due balances 

sdge and socalgas have been authorized to track and request recovery of incremental costs associated with complying with customer protection measures implemented by the cpuc related to the covid19 pandemic including costs associated with suspending service disconnections and uncollectible expenses that arise from customers’ failure to pay sdge and socalgas expect to pursue recovery of small and mediumlarge commercial and industrial customers’ tracked costs in rates in future cpuc proceedings which recovery is not assured uncollectible expenses related to residential customers are recorded in a twoway balancing account as we discuss below 

the continuation of these circumstances could result in a further reduction in payments received from sdge’s and socalgas’ customers and a further increase in uncollectible accounts which could become material and any inability or delay in recovering all or a substantial portion of these costs could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects of sempra sdge and socalgas we discuss regulatory mechanisms in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of c ontents 

disconnection oir 

in june 2020 the cpuc issued a decision addressing residential service disconnections that among other things allows sdge and socalgas to each establish a twoway balancing account to record the uncollectible expenses associated with residential customers’ inability to pay their electric or gas bills this decision which became effective in february 2021 also directs sdge and socalgas to each establish an amp that provides successfully participating incomequalified residential customers with relief from outstanding utility bill amounts sdge and socalgas have recorded changes in their allowances for uncollectible accounts at december 31 2021 primarily related to expected forgiveness of outstanding bill amounts for customers eligible under the amp the amp could result in a further reduction in payments received from sdge’s and socalgas’ customers and a further increase to uncollectible accounts which could become material and any inability to recover these costs could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects of sempra sdge and socalgas 

ccm 

a cpuc cost of capital proceeding determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base in december 2019 the cpuc approved the cost of capital and rate structures for sdge and socalgas that became effective on january 1 2020 and will remain in effect through december 31 2022 subject to the ccm 

the ccm applies in the interim years between required cost of capital applications and considers changes in the cost of capital based on changes in interest rates based on the applicable utility bond index published by moody’s the ccm benchmark rate for each 12month period ending september 30 the measurement period the ccm benchmark rate is the basis of comparison to determine if the ccm is triggered which occurs if the change in the applicable moody’s utility bond index relative to the ccm benchmark rate is larger than plus or minus 1000 at the end of the measurement period the index applicable to sdge and socalgas is based on each utility’s credit rating sdge’s ccm benchmark rate is 4498 based on moody’s baa utility bond index and socalgas’ ccm benchmark rate is 4029 based on moody’s a utility bond index alternatively under the ccm sdge and socalgas are permitted to file a cost of capital application in an interim year in which an extraordinary or catastrophic event materially impacts its cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole 

for the measurement period ended september 30 2021 the ccm would trigger for sdge because the average moody’s baa utility bond index between october 1 2020 and september 30 2021 was 117 below sdge’s ccm benchmark rate of 4498 in august 2021 sdge filed an application with the cpuc to update its cost of capital effective january 1 2022 due to the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic rather than have the ccm apply in this application sdge proposed to adjust its authorized capital structure by increasing its common equity ratio from 52 to 54 sdge also proposed to increase its authorized roe from 1020 to 1055 and decrease its authorized cost of debt from 459 to 384 as a result sdge’s proposed return on rate base would decrease from 755 to 746 if such application is approved by the cpuc as filed sdge filed a joint motion with pge and edison to consolidate all three utilities’ cost of capital applications given the overlapping issues of law and fact which joint motion was granted in october 2021 in december 2021 the cpuc established a proceeding to determine if sdge’s cost of capital was impacted by an extraordinary event if the cpuc finds that there was not an extraordinary event the ccm would be effective retroactive to january 1 2022 and would automatically adjust sdge’s authorized roe from 1020 to 962 and adjust its authorized cost of debt to reflect the then current embedded cost and projected interest rate if the cpuc finds that there was an extraordinary event it will then determine whether to suspend the ccm for 2022 and preserve sdge’s current authorized cost of capital or hold a second phase of the proceeding to set a new cost of capital for 2022 sdge expects a final decision in the second half of 2022 in december 2021 the cpuc granted sdge the establishment of memorandum accounts effective january 1 2022 to track any differences in revenue requirement resulting from the interim cost of capital decision expected in 2022 

for the measurement period ended september 30 2021 the ccm was not triggered for socalgas sdge and socalgas are required to file their next cost of capital applications in april 2022 for a january 1 2023 effective date we further discuss the ccm in “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

sdge 

wildfire fund 

the carrying value of sdge’s wildfire fund asset totals 360 million at december 31 2021 we describe the wildfire legislation related accounting treatment and sdge’s commitment to make annual shareholder contributions to the wildfire fund through 2028 in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sdge is exposed to the risk that the participating california electric ious may incur thirdparty wildfire costs for which they will seek recovery from the wildfire fund with respect to wildfires that have occurred since enactment of the wildfire legislation 

table of c ontents 

in july 2019 in such a situation sdge may recognize a reduction of its wildfire fund asset and record an impairment charge against earnings when there is a reduction of the available coverage due to recoverable claims from any of the participating ious pge has indicated that it will seek reimbursement from the wildfire fund for losses associated with the dixie fire which burned from july 2021 through october 2021 and was reported to be the largest single wildfire measured by acres burned in california history if any california electric iou’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire it could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra’s financial condition and results of operations up to the carrying value of our wildfire fund asset with additional potential material exposure if sdge’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire in addition the wildfire fund could be completely exhausted due to fires in the other california electric ious’ service territories by fires in sdge’s service territory or by a combination thereof in the event that the wildfire fund is materially diminished exhausted or terminated sdge will lose the protection afforded by the wildfire fund and as a consequence a fire in sdge’s service territory could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

wildfire cost recovery mechanism 

in july 2021 sdge filed a request with the cpuc to establish an interim cost recovery mechanism that would recover in rates 50 of its wildfire mitigation plan regulatory account balance as of january 1 of each year such potential recovery would be incremental to wildfire costs authorized in its grc and would be subject to reasonableness review we expect the cpuc to issue a final decision in the first half of 2022 

songs decommissioning 

sdge has significant investments in the songs ndt to provide for future payments of nuclear decommissioning the ndt’s ability to make ongoing required payments have not been materially or adversely affected by changes in asset values which are dependent on market fluctuations contributions and withdrawals however asset values could be materially and adversely affected by future activity in the equity and fixed income markets and changes in the estimated decommissioning costs or in the assumptions and judgments made by management underlying these estimates could cause revisions to the estimated total cost associated with retiring the assets funding requirements are generally recoverable in rates we discuss sdge’s ndt and its expected songs decommissioning payments in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

socalgas 

socalgas’ future performance and liquidity will be impacted by the resolution of legal regulatory and other matters concerning the leak which we discuss below in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

aliso canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak 

from october 23 2015 through february 11 2016 socalgas experienced a natural gas leak from one of the injectionandwithdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility located in los angeles county 

cost estimate accounting impact and insurance at december 31 2021 socalgas estimates certain costs related to the leak are 3221 million the cost estimate this cost estimate may increase significantly as more information becomes available a portion of the cost estimate has been paid and 1983 million is accrued as reserve for aliso canyon costs at december 31 2021 on socalgas’ and sempra’s consolidated balance sheets sempra elected to make an 800 million equity contribution to socalgas in september 2021 and may elect to make additional equity contributions in the future that are intended to maintain socalgas’ approved capital structure in connection with the accruals related to these agreements sempra does not expect to issue common equity to fund any such equity contributions 

except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain legal and regulatory matters the cost estimate does not include i any amounts necessary to resolve claims of individual plaintiffs who do not agree to participate in the settlement of the individual actions or members of the property class action who opt out of that settlement or ii the matters that we describe in “civil litigation – unresolved litigation” and “regulatory proceedings” in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements to the extent it is not possible to predict at this time the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the possible costs or a range of possible costs for damages restitution civil or administrative fines or penalties defense settlement or other costs or remedies that may be imposed or incurred the cost estimate also does not include certain other costs incurred by sempra 

table of c ontents 

associated with defending against shareholder derivative lawsuits and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate further we are not able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued these costs or losses not included in the cost estimate could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

we have received insurance payments for many of the categories of costs included in the cost estimate including temporary relocation and associated processing costs controlofwell expenses costs of the governmentordered response to the leak certain legal costs and lost gas as of december 31 2021 we recorded the expected recovery of the cost estimate related to the leak of 360 million as insurance receivable for aliso canyon costs on socalgas’ and sempra’s consolidated balance sheets this amount is exclusive of insurance retentions and 919 million of insurance proceeds we received through december 31 2021 we intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for the costs we have incurred other than insurance for certain future defense costs we may incur as well as directors’ and officers’ liability we have exhausted all of our insurance in this matter we continue to pursue other sources of insurance coverage for costs related to this matter but we may not be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for any of these costs if we are not able to secure additional insurance recovery if any costs we have recorded as an insurance receivable are not collected if there are delays in receiving insurance recoveries or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible such amounts which could be significant could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

natural gas storage operations and reliability natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods including peak electric generation needs in the summer and consumer heating needs in the winter the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility is the largest socalgas storage facility and an important component of socalgas’ delivery system as a result of the leak the cpuc has issued a series of directives to socalgas specifying the range of working gas to be maintained in the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility as well as protocols for the withdrawal of gas to support safe and reliable natural gas service in february 2017 the cpuc opened a proceeding pursuant to the sb 380 oii to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region including considering alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility’s services if it were eliminated 

at december 31 2021 the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of 883 million if the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value we may record an impairment of the facility incur higher than expected operating costs andor be required to make additional capital expenditures any or all of which may not be recoverable in rates and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

labor relations 

field technical and most clerical employees at socalgas are represented by the utility workers union of america or the international chemical workers union council on october 1 2021 a new collective bargaining agreement for these employees covering wages hours working conditions and medical and other benefits went into effect through september 2024 

franchise agreement 

socalgas’ natural gas franchise agreement with the city of los angeles expired on december 31 2021 in december 2021 the los angeles city council awarded socalgas a new 21year natural gas franchise following an invitation for bids which was approved and signed by the city of los angeles mayor in january 2022 the 21year term consists of an initial 13year term from the effective date followed by an 8year term that the city of los angeles has the option to terminate among other conditions the new franchise agreement is subject to cpuc approval of the rates and surcharges therein for it to become effective which socalgas filed for in february 2022 in the interim socalgas continues to serve customers located in the city of los angeles in accordance with the expired agreement by operation of law

sempra texas utilities 

oncor relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements in the event that oncor fails to meet its capital requirements or is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs we may elect to make additional capital contributions to oncor as our commitments to the puct prohibit us from making loans to oncor which could be substantial and reduce the cash available to us for other purposes increase our indebtedness and ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects oncor’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by factors such as its credit ratings regulatory capital requirements increases in its capital plan debttoequity ratio approved by the puct and other restrictions and considerations in addition oncor will not pay dividends if a majority of oncor’s independent directors or any minority member director determines it is in the best interests of oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements 

winter weather event 

in february 2021 ercot required electric distribution companies including oncor to significantly reduce demand on the grid because electricity generation was insufficient to meet demand due to extreme winter weather as a result of the load shedding events and statewide power outages the puct other governmental authorities or third parties including oncor’s customers have taken or could take other measures to address financial challenges experienced as a result of the event which could adversely impact oncor’s collections and cash flows and in turn could adversely impact sempra the texas legislature has passed and the governor of texas has signed various legislation affecting the ercot market which addresses matters including certain weatherization requirements and fines of up to 1 million per day for failures to comply with such requirements enabling ercot to finance certain amounts owed by ercot market participants relating to the winter weather event creation of the texas energy reliability council identification of gas facilities that are critical to electricgenerator fuel supplies coordination between the gas and electric industries and changes in the composition of the puct and the ercot board of directors in addition various regulatory and governmental entities have also commenced investigations or indicated an intent to investigate the operation of the ercot grid during this extreme winter weather event and potential future actions to improve grid reliability any significant changes relating to the ercot market that impact transmission and distribution utilities as a result of such proceedings or otherwise could materially adversely impact oncor if oncor does not successfully respond to these changes and any other legislative regulatory or market or industry developments applicable to it oncor could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects which could materially adversely affect sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects

our investment in oncor holdings is a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we discuss variable interests in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sempra infrastructure 

sempra infrastructure expects to fund capital expenditures investments and operations in part with available funds including credit facilities and cash flows from operations of the sempra infrastructure businesses we expect sempra infrastructure will require additional funding for the development and expansion of its portfolio of projects which may be financed through a combination of funding from the parent and minority interest owners bank financing issuances of debt project financing and partnering in jvs we describe sempra infrastructure’s commitments related to construction and development projects in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as we discuss in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in october 2021 sempra infrastructure completed the sale of a 20 nci in si partners to kkr for cash proceeds of 32 billion including postclosing adjustments and net of 173 million in transaction costs we used the proceeds from the sale to kkr to partially fund the early redemption of 235 billion of sempra’s longterm debt which we discuss above in “longterm debt activities” and to help fund capital investments in support of incremental growth at sempra california and sempra texas utilities 

in december 2021 we entered into an agreement to sell a 10 nci in si partners to adia for cash proceeds of 18 billion subject to adjustments we expect the transaction will close in the summer of 2022 we intend to use the expected proceeds from the sale to adia to help fund incremental capital expenditures at sempra california and sempra texas utilities to repay commercial paper borrowings used to repurchase 500 million in shares of our common stock 300 million of which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and an additional 200 million of which was completed in the first quarter of 2022 and further strengthen our balance sheet our ability to complete the adia transaction is subject to a number of risks including among others the ability to obtain regulatory and thirdparty approvals and satisfy other customary closing conditions if we are not able to obtain these approvals and satisfy all other closing conditions in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms then the 

table of c ontents 

proposed transaction may be abandoned andor our prospects for sempra infrastructure and in turn sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected 

following the closing of the adia transaction sempra kkr and adia would directly or indirectly own a 70 20 and 10 interest respectively in si partners the sale of nci in si partners to kkr has reduced and the agreed sale of nci in si partners to adia would further reduce our ownership interest in si partners and these sales require us to share control over certain business decisions with the minority partners which introduces a number of risks associated with sharing business control moreover the decrease in our ownership of si partners also decreases our share of the cash flows profits and other benefits these businesses currently or may in the future produce which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

lng and netzero solutions 

cameron lng jv liquefaction expansion project phase 2 cameron lng jv received major permits and fta and nonfta approvals associated with the expansion of the current configuration of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project beyond phase 1 those permits for the phase 2 project included up to two additional liquefaction trains and up to two additional full containment lng storage tanks in january 2022 cameron lng jv filed an amendment subject to approval by the ferc to modify the permits to allow the use of electric drives instead of gas turbine drives which would reduce overall emissions we expect the proposed expansion project will initially have one train with offtake capacity of approximately 675 mtpa with the ability to increase capacity with debottlenecking of the existing trains and the site can accommodate additional trains beyond phase 2 

sempra has entered into mous with totalenergies se mitsui  co ltd and mitsubishi corporation that provide a framework for cooperation for the development of and offtake from the potential cameron lng jv phase 2 project the ultimate participation of and offtake by totalenergies se mitsui  co ltd and mitsubishi corporation remains subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements among other factors and totalenergies se mitsui  co ltd and mitsubishi corporation have no commitment to participate in or enter into offtake agreements with respect to the phase 2 project unless such definitive agreements are established 

expansion of the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the jv project financing agreements including among others timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the phase 1 project lenders under the cameron lng jv equity agreements the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all the partners including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner discussions among all the cameron lng jv partners have been taking place regarding how an expansion may be structured including a facility design utilizing electric drives and we expect that discussions will continue although we are working towards making a final investment decision in the first half of 2023 the timing of when or if cameron lng jv will receive approval to amend the permits is uncertain and there is no assurance that the cameron lng jv members will unanimously agree in a timely manner or at all on an expansion structure which if not accomplished would materially and adversely impact the development of the phase 2 project 

the development of the potential cameron lng jv phase 2 project is subject to numerous other risks and uncertainties including securing binding customer commitments reaching unanimous agreement with our partners to proceed obtaining and maintaining a number of permits and regulatory approvals securing financing negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including a definitive epc contract equity acquisition and governance agreements reaching a positive final investment decision and other factors associated with this potential investment for a discussion of these risks see “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

eca lng liquefaction export projects sempra infrastructure is developing two natural gas liquefaction export projects at its existing eca regas facility the liquefaction export projects which are planned for development in two phases a midscale project by eca lng phase 1 that is under construction and a proposed largescale project by eca lng phase 2 are being developed to provide buyers with direct access to north american west coast lng supplies we do not expect the construction or operation of the eca lng phase 1 project to disrupt operations at the eca regas facility but have planned measures to limit disruption of operations should any arise however construction of the proposed eca lng phase 2 project would conflict with the current operations at the eca regas facility which currently has longterm regasification contracts for 100 of the regasification facility’s capacity through 2028 making the decisions on whether and how to pursue the eca lng phase 2 project dependent in part on whether the investment in a largescale liquefaction facility would over the long term be more beneficial financially than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts 

in march 2019 eca lng received two authorizations from the doe to export usproduced natural gas to mexico and to reexport lng to nonfta countries from its eca lng phase 1 project which is a onetrain natural gas liquefaction facility with a

nameplate capacity of 325 mtpa and initial offtake capacity of approximately 25 mtpa that is under construction and its proposed eca lng phase 2 project that is in development 

in april 2020 eca lng phase 1 executed definitive 20year lng sale and purchase agreements with mitsui  co ltd for approximately 08 mtpa of lng and with an affiliate of totalenergies se for approximately 17 mtpa of lng in december 2020 an affiliate of totalenergies se acquired a 166 ownership interest in eca lng phase 1 with sempra infrastructure retaining an 834 ownership interest our mou with mitsui  co ltd provides a framework for mitsui  co ltd’s potential offtake of lng from and potential acquisition of an equity interest in eca lng phase 2 

in february 2020 we entered into an epc contract with technip energies for the engineering procurement and construction of the eca lng phase 1 project since reaching a positive final investment decision with respect to the project in november 2020 we released technip energies to commence work to construct the eca lng phase 1 project the total price of the epc contract is estimated at approximately 15 billion we estimate that capital expenditures will approximate 20 billion including capitalized interest and project contingency the actual cost of the epc contract and the actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ perhaps substantially from our estimates we expect eca lng phase 1 to begin producing lng by the end of 2024 

in december 2020 eca lng phase 1 entered into a fiveyear loan agreement for an aggregate principal amount of up to 16 billion of which 341 million was outstanding at december 31 2021 proceeds from the loan are being used to finance the cost of construction of the eca lng phase 1 project we discuss the details of this loan in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the construction of the eca lng phase 1 project and the development of the potential eca lng phase 2 project are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties for phase 1 these include maintaining permits and regulatory approvals construction delays securing and maintaining commercial arrangements such as gas supply and transportation agreements the impact of recent and proposed changes to the law in mexico and other factors associated with the project and its construction for phase 2 these include obtaining binding customer commitments the receipt of a number of permits and regulatory approvals obtaining financing negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including a definitive epc contract equity acquisition and governance agreements lng sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements reaching a positive final investment decision the impact of recent and proposed changes to the law in mexico and other factors associated with this potential investment in addition as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements an unfavorable decision on certain property disputes or permit challenges an unfavorable judgment that does not allow sempra infrastructure to secure new or renew existing lda authorizations or an extended dispute with existing customers at the eca regas facility could materially adversely affect the development and construction of these projects and sempra’s results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects including the impairment of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in the projects to date for a discussion of these risks see “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

port arthur lng liquefaction export project sempra infrastructure is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction export project on a greenfield site that it owns in the vicinity of port arthur texas located along the sabineneches waterway sempra infrastructure received authorizations from the doe in august 2015 and may 2019 that collectively permit the lng to be produced from the proposed port arthur lng project to be exported to all current and future fta and nonfta countries in february 2020 sempra infrastructure filed an application with the doe to permit lng produced from a second phase of the proposed port arthur lng facility to be exported to all current and future fta and nonfta countries 

in april 2019 the ferc approved the siting construction and operation of the proposed port arthur lng liquefaction facility along with certain natural gas pipelines including the louisiana connector and texas connector pipelines that could be used to supply feed gas to the liquefaction facility if and when the project is completed in february 2020 sempra infrastructure filed a ferc application for the siting construction and operation of a second phase of the proposed port arthur lng facility including the potential addition of two liquefaction trains 

in february 2020 we entered into an epc contract with bechtel for the proposed port arthur lng liquefaction project the epc contract contemplates the construction of two liquefaction trains with a nameplate capacity of approximately 135 mtpa two lng storage tanks a marine berth and associated loading facilities and related infrastructure necessary to provide liquefaction services in december 2020 we amended and restated the epc contract to reflect an estimated price of approximately 87 billion since we did not issue a full notice to proceed by july 15 2021 agreement by both parties on an amendment to the epc contract is necessary to proceed such amendment may adjust the epc contract price and the epc schedule and could potentially include other changes to the work and terms and conditions of the epc contract any agreement on such an amendment by both parties or on favorable terms to sempra cannot be assured

acquisition of esj as we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in march 2021 sempra infrastructure increased its ownership interest in esj from 50 to 100 by acquiring saavi energía’s 50 equity interest in esj 

legal and regulatory matters 

see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussions of the following legal and regulatory matters affecting our operations in mexico 

energía costa azul 

▪ land disputes 

table of c ontents 

▪ environmental and social impact permits 

▪ customer dispute 

one or more unfavorable final decisions on these land and customer disputes or environmental and social impact permit challenges could materially adversely affect our existing natural gas regasification operations and proposed natural gas liquefaction projects at the site of the eca regas facility and have a material adverse effect on sempra’s business results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

sonora pipeline 

▪ guaymasel oro segment 

▪ sasabepuerto libertadguaymas segment 

our investment in the guaymasel oro segment of the sonora pipeline could be subject to impairment if sempra infrastructure is unable to make certain repairs which have not commenced or reroute a portion of the pipeline which has not been agreed to by the parties but is subject to negotiation pursuant to a nonbinding mou as described above and resume operations in the guaymasel oro segment of the sonora pipeline or if sempra infrastructure terminates the contract and is unable to obtain recovery in addition the failure to stay the court judgment nullifying sempra infrastructure’s rightofway easement for a portion of the sasabepuerto libertadguaymas segment of the sonora pipeline pending the resolution of sempra infrastructure’s planned special judicial action or prevail in preserving the easement in the special judicial action could require us to modify the route of the pipeline and could require a temporary shutdown of this portion of the pipeline any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on sempra’s business results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

regulatory and other actions by the mexican government 

▪ transmission rates for legacy generation facilities 

▪ offtakers of legacy generation permits 

▪ amendments to mexico’s electricity industry law 

▪ amendments to mexico’s hydrocarbons law 

▪ amendments to mexico’s general foreign trade rules 

▪ proposed constitutional reform in mexico 

sempra infrastructure and other parties affected by these resolutions orders decrees regulations and proposed amendments to mexican law have challenged them by filing amparo and other claims some of which have been granted injunctive relief the courtordered injunctions or suspensions provide temporary relief until mexico’s federal district court or supreme court ultimately resolves the amparo and other claims if passed in its current form the proposed constitutional reform introduces significant changes to the legal and economic principles underlying the country’s energy reform of 2013 generating imminent risks for private investments in this sector an unfavorable decision on one or more of these amparo or other challenges the potential for extended disputes or if passed in its current form the proposed constitutional reform may impact our ability to operate our facilities at existing levels or at all may result in increased costs for sempra infrastructure and its customers may adversely affect our ability to develop new projects and may negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying values of our investments in mexico any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects

we invest the majority of our capital expenditures in sempra california primarily for transmission and distribution improvements including pipeline and wildfire safety the following table summarizes by segment capital expenditures for the last three years 

table of c ontents 



expenditures for investments and acquisitions 

the following table summarizes by segment our investments in various jvs as well as business and asset acquisitions 



future capital expenditures and investments 

the amounts and timing of capital expenditures and certain investments are generally subject to approvals by various regulatory and other governmental and environmental bodies including the cpuc the ferc and the puct and various other factors described in this mda and in “part i – item 1a risk factors” in 2022 we expect to make capital expenditures and investments of approximately 62 billion which excludes capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities as summarized by segment in the following table 



we expect the majority of our capital expenditures and investments in 2022 will relate to transmission and distribution improvements at our regulated public utilities and construction of the eca lng phase 1 liquefaction export project at sempra infrastructure 

from 2022 through 2026 and subject to the factors described below which could cause these estimates to vary substantially sempra expects to make aggregate capital expenditures and investments of approximately 244 billion which excludes capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities as follows 114 billion at sdge 98 billion at socalgas 11 billion at sempra texas utilities and 21 billion at sempra infrastructure capital expenditure amounts include capitalized interest and afudc related to debt 

periodically we review our construction investment and financing programs and revise them in response to changes in regulation economic conditions competition customer growth inflation customer rates the cost and availability of capital and safety and environmental requirements 

our level of capital expenditures and investments in the next few years may vary substantially and will depend on among other things the cost and availability of financing regulatory approvals changes in us federal tax law and business opportunities providing desirable rates of return see “part i – item 1a risk factors” for a discussion of other factors that could affect future 

table of c ontents 

levels of our capital expenditures and investments we intend to finance our capital expenditures in a manner that will maintain our investmentgrade credit ratings and capital structure but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so 

weightedaverage rate base 

rate base is the value of assets on which sdge and socalgas are permitted to earn a specified rate of return in accordance with rules set by regulatory agencies including the cpuc and the ferc for sdge which is calculated using a 13month average in accordance with cpuc methodology as adopted in ratesetting proceedings the following table summarizes the weightedaverage rate base for sdge and socalgas for the last three years 



the increase in weightedaverage rate base reflects the significant capital investments that sdge and socalgas have made in transmission and distribution safety and reliability we expect the weightedaverage rate base to continue to increase in 2022 based on our expected capital investments 

capital stock transactions 

sempra 

cash provided by issuances of common and preferred stock was 

▪ 5 million in 2021 

▪ 902 million in 2020 

▪ 18 billion in 2019 

ienova exchange offer and cash tender offer in may 2021 we acquired 381015194 publicly owned shares of ienova in exchange for 12306777 newly issued shares of our common stock upon completion of our exchange offer launched in the us and mexico which increased our ownership interest in ienova from 702 to 964 in september 2021 we completed a cash tender offer and acquired 51014545 publicly owned shares of ienova for 40 billion mexican pesos approximately 202 million in us dollars in cash which increased our ownership interest in ienova from 964 to 999 we describe these transactions in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in addition to being traded on the new york stock exchange sempra’s common stock is also listed on the mexican stock exchange under the trading symbol sremx ienova’s shares were delisted from the mexican stock exchange effective october 15 2021 in connection with the delisting we are maintaining a trust for the purpose of purchasing the 1212981 ienova shares that remained publicly owned as of the completion of the cash tender offer for 7897 mexican pesos per share the same price per share that was offered in our cash tender offer the trust will be in place through the earlier of april 14 2022 or the date on which we acquire all remaining publicly owned ienova shares as of february 16 2022 an aggregate of 629784 of the remaining publicly owned ienova shares had been acquired by such trust 

sempra common stock repurchases as we discuss in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in november and december of 2021 we entered into and completed an open market repurchase program under which we paid 300 million to repurchase 2422758 shares of our common stock at a weightedaverage purchase price of 12383 per share excluding commissions we repurchased an additional 1472756 shares of our common stock for 200 million pursuant to an asr program that was completed on february 11 2022 these share repurchases were funded with commercial paper borrowings that we plan to repay with a portion of the anticipated proceeds from the sale of nci in si partners to adia which we expect to close in the summer of 2022 subject to the receipt of certain regulatory and thirdparty approvals and other customary closing conditions

dividends 

sempra 

sempra paid cash dividends of 

▪ 1331 million for common stock and 99 million for preferred stock in 2021 

▪ 1174 million for common stock and 157 million for preferred stock in 2020 

▪ 993 million for common stock and 142 million for preferred stock in 2019 

dividends declared on common stock have increased in each of the last three years due to an increase in the pershare quarterly dividends approved by our board of directors to 110 in 2021 440 annually from 1045 in 2020 418 annually and from 09675 in 2019 387 annually 

on february 24 2022 our board of directors approved an increase in sempra’s quarterly common stock dividend to 1145 per share 458 annually the first of which is payable april 15 2022 in addition on february 24 2022 our board of directors declared semiannual dividends of 24375 per share on our series c preferred stock payable on april 15 2022 all declarations of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock are made at the discretion of the board of directors while we view dividends as an integral component of shareholder return the amount of future dividends will depend on earnings cash flows financial and legal requirements and other relevant factors at that time as a result sempra’s dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis including recent historical increases and annualized dividends for the current fiscal year may not be indicative of future declarations 

sdge 

in 2021 and 2020 sdge paid common stock dividends to enova and enova paid corresponding dividends to sempra of 300 million and 200 million respectively sdge did not declare or pay common stock dividends in 2019 sdge’s dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for sdge to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program 

enova a wholly owned subsidiary of sempra owns all of sdge’s outstanding common stock accordingly dividends paid by sdge to enova and dividends paid by enova to sempra are eliminated in sempra’s consolidated financial statements 

socalgas 

in 2021 2020 and 2019 socalgas paid common stock dividends to pe and pe paid corresponding dividends to sempra of 75 million 100 million and 150 million respectively socalgas’ dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for socalgas to maintain its authorized capital structure 

pe a wholly owned subsidiary of sempra owns all of socalgas’ outstanding common stock accordingly dividends paid by socalgas to pe and dividends paid by pe to sempra are eliminated in sempra’s consolidated financial statements 

dividend restrictions 

the board of directors for each of sempra sdge and socalgas has the discretion to determine whether to declare and if declared the amount of any dividends by each such entity the cpuc’s regulation of sdge’s and socalgas’ capital structures limits the amounts that are available for loans and dividends to sempra at december 31 2021 based on these regulations sempra could have received combined loans and dividends of approximately 798 million from sdge and 445 million from socalgas 

we provide additional information about dividend restrictions in “restricted net assets” in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

book value per common share 

sempra’s book value per common share on the last day of each of the last three fiscal years was as follows 

▪ 7917 in 2021 

▪ 7011 in 2020 

▪ 6058 in 2019 

the increase in 2021 was primarily due to a fair value that was higher than carrying value related to the change in ownership which did not result in a change of control from the sale of nci in si partners to kkr the ienova exchange offer and 

table of c ontents 

subsequent cash tender offer and the common shares issued from the conversion of series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock in 2020 the increase was primarily due to comprehensive income exceeding dividends offset by common stock repurchases 

capitalization 

our debt to capitalization ratio calculated as total debt as a percentage of total debt and equity was as follows 



significant changes in 2021 that affected capitalization included the following 

▪ sempra decrease in longterm debt offset by an increase in shortterm debt and increase in equity primarily from the sale of nci 

▪ sdge increase in shortterm and longterm debt and increase in equity from comprehensive income exceeding dividends 

▪ socalgas decrease in equity from comprehensive loss offset by equity contributions from sempra exceeding dividends 



critical accounting estimates 

management views certain accounting estimates as critical because their application is the most relevant judgmental andor material to our financial position and results of operations andor because they require the use of material judgments and estimates we discuss critical accounting estimates that are material to our financial statements with the audit committee of sempra’s board of directors 

contingencies 

sempra sdge socalgas 

we accrue losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes for loss contingencies we accrue the loss if an event has occurred on or before the balance sheet date and if 

▪ information available through the date we file our financial statements indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred given the likelihood of uncertain future events 

▪ the amount of the loss or a range of possible losses can be reasonably estimated 

we do not accrue contingencies that might result in gains we continuously assess contingencies for litigation claims environmental remediation and other events 

actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and may affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows details of our issues in this area are discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of c ontents 

regulatory accounting 

sempra sdge socalgas 

as regulated entities sdge’s and socalgas’ customer rates as set and monitored by regulators are designed to recover the cost of providing service and provide the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investments sdge and socalgas assess probabilities of future rate recovery associated with regulatory account balances at the end of each reporting period and whenever new andor unusual events occur such as 

▪ changes in the regulatory and political environment or the utility’s competitive position 

▪ issuance of a regulatory commission order 

▪ passage of new legislation 

to the extent that circumstances associated with regulatory balances change the regulatory balances are evaluated and adjusted if appropriate 

significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and plant investments the recognition of incentives and revenues subject to refund as well as the existence and amount of regulatory liabilities adverse regulatory or legislative actions could materially impact the amounts of our regulatory assets and liabilities and could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition specifically if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable all or part of the associated regulatory assets andor plant investments would need to be written off against current period earnings or adverse regulatory or legislative actions could give rise to material new or higher regulatory liabilities we discuss details of sdge’s and socalgas’ regulatory assets and liabilities and additional factors that management considers when assessing probabilities associated with regulatory balances in notes 1 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

sempra sdge socalgas 

our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management judgments and estimates amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as well as current and noncurrent accruals involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities when we evaluate the anticipated resolution of income tax issues we consider 

▪ past resolutions of the same issue or similar issues 

▪ the status of any income tax examination in progress 

▪ positions taken by taxing authorities with other taxpayers with similar issues 

the likelihood of deferred income tax recovery is based on analyses of the deferred income tax assets and our expectation of future taxable income based on our strategic planning should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset we would record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes 

actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts because of 

▪ future impacts of various items including changes in tax laws regulations interpretations and rulings 

▪ our financial condition in future periods 

▪ the resolution of various income tax issues between us and taxing and regulatory authorities 

unrecognized tax benefits involve management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of the benefit being sustained the final resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in adjustments to recorded amounts and may affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we discuss these matters and additional information related to accounting for income taxes including uncertainty in income taxes in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

derivatives accounting 

table of c ontents 

sempra sdge 

we record derivative instruments for which we do not apply a scope exception at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets we also use the normal purchase or sale exception for certain derivative contracts which is applied on a contractbycontract basis changes in assumed physical delivery on contracts for which we elected normal purchase or sale accounting may result in “tainting” of the election which may preclude us from making this election in future transactions thereby impacting sempra’s andor sdge’s results of operations the impacts of derivatives accounting on sdge’s results of operations are typically not significant because regulatory accounting principles generally apply to its contracts we provide details of our derivative instruments and our fair value approaches in notes 11 and 12 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

sempra sdge socalgas 

to measure our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations costs and liabilities we rely on several assumptions we consider current market conditions including interest rates in making these assumptions we review these assumptions annually and update when appropriate 

the critical assumptions used to develop the required estimates include the following key factors 

▪ discount rates 

▪ expected return on plan assets 

▪ health care cost trend rates 

▪ mortality rates 

▪ rate of compensation increases 

▪ termination and retirement rates 

▪ utilization of postretirement welfare benefits 

▪ payout elections lump sum or annuity 

▪ lump sum interest rates 

the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to 

▪ return on plan assets 

▪ changing market and economic conditions 

▪ higher or lower withdrawal rates 

▪ longer or shorter participant life spans 

▪ more or fewer lump sum versus annuity payout elections made by plan participants 

▪ higher or lower retirement rates 

changes in the estimated costs or timing of pension and other postretirement benefits or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates primarily the discount rate and assumed rate of return on plan assets as well as changes in the circumstances associated with rate recovery could have a material effect on the recorded expenses and liabilities the following tables summarize the impact to our projected benefit obligation for pension accumulated benefit obligation for pbop and projected benefit costs in each case if the discount rate or assumed rate of return on plan assets were changed by 100 bps at december 31 2021 



table of c ontents 



for sdge and socalgas plans the effects of the assumptions on earnings are expected to be recovered in rates and therefore are offset in regulatory accounts we provide details of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

asset retirement obligations 

sempra sdge 

sdge’s legal aros related to the decommissioning of songs are estimated based on a sitespecific study performed no less than every three years the estimate of the obligations includes 

▪ estimated decommissioning costs including labor equipment material and other disposal costs 

▪ inflation adjustment applied to estimated cash flows 

▪ discount rate based on a creditadjusted riskfree rate 

▪ actual decommissioning costs progress to date and expected duration of decommissioning activities 

sdge’s nuclear decommissioning expenses are subject to rate recovery and therefore ratemaking accounting treatment is applied to sdge’s nuclear decommissioning activities sdge recognizes a regulatory asset or liability to the extent that its songs aro exceeds or is less than the amount collected from customers and the amount earned in sdge’s ndt 

sdge’s aro related to the decommissioning of songs was 568 million as of december 31 2021 based on the decommissioning cost study prepared in 2020 changes in the estimated costs execution strategy or timing of decommissioning or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission this facility which could have a material effect on the recorded liability 

the following table illustrates the increase to sdge’s and sempra’s aro liability if the cost escalation rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant 



the increase in the aro liability driven by an increase in the cost escalation rate would result in a decrease in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of aro liabilities we provide additional detail in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment testing of longlived assets 

sempra 

whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable we consider if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset if so we estimate the fair value of the asset to determine the extent to which carrying value exceeds fair value for such an estimate we may consider data from multiple valuation methods including data from market participants we exercise judgment to estimate the future cash flows and the useful life of a longlived asset and to determine our intent to use the asset our intent to use or dispose of a longlived asset is subject to reevaluation and can change over time if an impairment test is required the fair value of a longlived asset can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include 

table of c ontents 

▪ consideration of market transactions 

▪ future cash flows 

▪ the appropriate riskadjusted discount rate including the impacts of country risk and entity risk 

we discuss impairment of longlived assets in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment testing of goodwill 

sempra 

when determining if goodwill is impaired the fair value of the reporting unit can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions as a result recognizing a goodwill impairment may or may not be required when we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we exercise judgment to develop estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to its carrying value our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant we consider observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments if available as well as an incomebased approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis a discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future revenues and expenses and may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the reporting unit critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include 

▪ consideration of market transactions 

▪ future cash flows 

▪ projected revenue and expense growth rates 

▪ the appropriate riskadjusted discount rate including the impacts of country risk and entity risk 

in 2021 and 2020 we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units in mexico to which goodwill was allocated was substantially above their carrying value for each year as of october 1 our goodwill impairment testing date 

new accounting standards 

we discuss the recent accounting pronouncements that have had or may have a significant effect on our financial statements andor disclosures in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of erosion of our cash flows earnings asset values or equity due to adverse changes in commodity market prices interest rates and foreign currency and inflation rates 

risk policies 

sempra has policies governing its market risk management and trading activities sempra sdge socalgas and sempra infrastructure maintain separate risk management committees organizations and processes to provide oversight of these activities for their respective businesses the committees consist of senior officers who establish policy oversee energy risk management activities and monitor the results of trading and other activities to help ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies these activities include but are not limited to monitoring of market positions that create credit liquidity and market risk the respective oversight organizations and committees are independent from energy procurement departments 

along with other tools we use var and liquidity metrics to measure our exposure to market risk associated with commodity portfolios var is an estimate of the potential loss on a position or portfolio of positions over a specified holding period based on normal market conditions and within a given statistical confidence interval we use a variancecovariance var model at a 95 confidence level a liquidity metric is intended to monitor the amount of financial resources needed for meeting potential margin calls as forward market prices move var and liquidity risk metrics are independently verified by the respective risk management oversight organizations 

table of c ontents 

sdge and socalgas use power and natural gas derivatives to manage electric and natural gas price risk associated with servicing load requirements the use of power and natural gas derivatives is subject to certain limitations imposed by company policy and is in compliance with risk management and trading activity plans that have been filed with and approved by the cpuc we discuss revenue recognition in note 3 and additional marketrisk information regarding derivative instruments in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have exposure to changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency and inflation rates the following discussion of these primary marketrisk exposures as of december 31 2021 includes a discussion of how these exposures are managed 

commodity price risk 

market risk related to physical commodities is created by volatility in the prices and basis of certain commodities our various subsidiaries are exposed in varying degrees to commodity price risk primarily to prices in the natural gas and electricity markets our policy is to manage this risk within a framework that considers the specific markets and operating and regulatory environments of each subsidiary 

sempra infrastructure is generally exposed to commodity price risk indirectly through its lng natural gas pipelines and storage and powergenerating assets this segment may utilize commodity transactions in an effort to optimize these assets these transactions are typically priced based on market indices but may also include fixed price purchases and sales of commodities any residual exposure is monitored as described above a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in commodity prices would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our commoditybased natural gas and electricity derivatives of 3 million and 4 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the impact of a change in energy commodity prices on our commoditybased derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled and does not typically include the generally offsetting impact of our underlying asset positions 

sdge and socalgas separately manage risk within the parameters of their market risk management frameworks in addition their marketrisk exposure is limited due to cpucauthorized rate recovery of the costs of commodity purchases interstate and intrastate transportation and storage activity however socalgas may at times be exposed to market risk as a result of the gcim which rewards or penalizes the utility for commodity costs below or above certain benchmarks the oneday var for sdge and socalgas’ commodity positions were 5 million and 1 million respectively at december 31 2021 and 3 million and negligible respectively at december 31 2020 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily as a result of our having issued short and longterm debt subject to regulatory constraints we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to moderate our exposure to interest rate changes and to lower our overall cost of borrowing 

the table below shows the nominal amount of our debt 



1 after the effects of interest rate swaps before the effects of acquisitionrelated fair value adjustments and reductions for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs and excluding finance lease obligations 

an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis measures interest rate risk by calculating the estimated changes in earnings that would result from a hypothetical change in market interest rates earnings are affected by changes in interest rates on shortterm debt and 

table of c ontents 

variablerate longterm debt if weightedaverage interest rates on shortterm debt outstanding at december 31 2021 increased or decreased by 10 the change in earnings over the 12month period ending december 31 2022 would be approximately 1 million if interest rates increased or decreased by 10 on all variablerate longterm debt at december 31 2021 after considering the effects of interest rate swaps the change in earnings over the 12month period ending december 31 2022 would be approximately 1 million 

we provide further information about debt and interest rate swap transactions in notes 7 and 11 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we also are subject to the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the assets of our pension plans other postretirement benefit plans and sdge’s ndt however we expect the effects of these fluctuations as they relate to sempra california to be reflected in future rates  

foreign currency and inflation rate risk 

we discuss our foreign currency and inflation exposures in “part ii – item 7 mda – impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations” 

the hypothetical effect for every 10 appreciation in the us dollar against the mexican peso in which we have operations and investments are as follows 



1 after the effects of foreign currency derivatives 

2 amount represents the impact to earnings for a change in the average exchange rate throughout the reporting period 

3 amount primarily represents the effects of currency exchange rate movement from december 31 2021 on monetary assets and liabilities and translation of nonus deferred income tax balances at our mexican subsidiaries 

4 amount represents the effects of currency exchange rate movement from december 31 2021 that would be recorded to oci at the end of the reporting period 

monetary assets and liabilities at our mexican subsidiaries and jvs that are denominated in us dollars may fluctuate significantly throughout the year these monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes based on a net monetary liability position of 48 billion including those related to our investments in jvs at december 31 2021 the hypothetical effect of a 10 increase in the mexican inflation rate is approximately 111 million lower earnings as a result of higher income tax expense for our consolidated subsidiaries as well as lower equity earnings for our jvs 

we completed the sales of our south american businesses in 2020 and are no longer exposed to changes in foreign currency and inflation rates in peru and chile

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

sempra sdge socalgas 

sempra sdge and socalgas maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in their respective reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and is accumulated and communicated to the management of each company including each respective principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating these controls and procedures the management of each company recognizes that any system of controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives therefore the management of each company applies judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of sempra sdge and socalgas each such company’s management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2021 the end of the period covered by this report based on these evaluations the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of sempra sdge and socalgas concluded that their respective company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

sempra sdge socalgas 

the respective management of sempra sdge and socalgas is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f 

under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of sempra sdge and socalgas each such company’s management evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on these evaluations each company’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2021 deloitte  touche llp audited the effectiveness of each company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 as stated in their reports which are included in this annual report on form 10k 

in april 2021 sdge implemented a new customer information system to replace its legacy system the system has been designed and implemented to provide customers an enhanced digital experience and enhance the overall system of internal control over financial reporting through further automation and integration of business processes including revenue in connection with the implementation sdge performed preimplementation planning design and testing of internal controls that became effective in the second quarter of 2021 in the fourth quarter of 2021 sdge completed its postimplementation monitoring and process modifications in order to maintain an effective control framework other than these postimplementation activities in connection with sdge’s new customer information system there have been no changes in sempra’s sdge’s or socalgas’ internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect any such company’s internal control over financial reporting

item 1 business 

overview 

we are a californiabased holding company with energy infrastructure investments in north america our businesses invest in develop and operate energy infrastructure and provide electric and gas services to customers through regulated public utilities 

sempra energy was formed in 1998 through a business combination of enova and pe the holding companies of our regulated public utilities in california sdge which began operations in 1881 and socalgas which began operations in 1867 we have since expanded our regulated public utility presence into texas through our 8025 interest in oncor and 50 interest in sharyland utilities 

we have had a strong and growing presence in mexico through ienova ienova has a diverse portfolio of energy infrastructure projects and assets serving mexico’s growing energy needs our energy infrastructure footprint includes our 502 interest in cameron lng jv which is a natural gas liquefaction export facility operating in louisiana and construction and development of lng projects and assets on the gulf coast and pacific coast of north america 

in 2018 we announced a multiphase portfolio optimization initiative designed to sharpen our strategic focus on north america we have since executed on that initiative by completing the sales of our renewables businesses and our nonutility natural gas storage assets in the us and by completing the sales of our businesses in south america we present the south american businesses as discontinued operations throughout this report 

business strategy 

our mission is to be north america’s premier energy infrastructure company we are primarily focused on transmission and distribution investments among other areas that we believe are capable of producing stable cash flows and improved earnings visibility with the goal of delivering safe and reliable energy to our customers and increasing shareholder value 

description of business by segment 

our business activities are organized under the following reportable segments 

▪ sdge 

▪ socalgas 

▪ sempra texas utilities 

▪ sempra mexico 

▪ sempra lng 

sdge 

sdge is a regulated public utility that provides electric services to a population of at december 31 2020 approximately 37 million and natural gas services to approximately 34 million of that population covering a 4100 square mile service territory in southern california that encompasses san diego county and an adjacent portion of orange county 

sdge’s assets at december 31 2020 covered the following territory 

electric utility operations 

electric transmission and distribution system service to sdge’s customers is supported by its electric transmission and distribution system which includes substations and overhead and underground lines these electric facilities are primarily in the san diego imperial and orange counties of california and in arizona and nevada and consisted of 2129 miles of transmission lines 23926 miles of distribution lines and 183 substations at december 31 2020 periodically various areas of the service territory require expansion to accommodate customer growth and maintain reliability and safety 

sdge’s 500kv southwest powerlink transmission line which is shared with arizona public service company and imperial irrigation district extends from palo verde arizona to san diego california sdge’s share of the line is 1162 mw although it can be less under certain system conditions sdge’s sunrise powerlink is a 500kv transmission line constructed and operated by sdge with import capability of 1000 mw of power 

mexico’s baja california transmission system is connected to sdge’s system via two 230kv interconnections with combined capacity of up to 600 mw in the northtosouth direction and 800 mw in the southtonorth direction although it can be less under certain system conditions 

edison’s transmission system is connected to sdge’s system via five 230kv transmission lines 

electric resources to meet customer demand sdge supplies power from its own electric generation facilities and procures power on a longterm basis from other suppliers for resale through cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts or through purchases on a spot basis sdge does not earn any return on commodity sales volumes sdge’s supply at december 31 2020 was as follows 



1   excludes approximately 1075 mw of battery storage owned and approximately 174 mw of battery storage contracted 

2   sdge owns and operates four natural gasfired power plants three of which are in california and one of which is in nevada 

charges under contracts with suppliers are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity tolling contracts are purchasedpower contracts under which sdge provides natural gas for generation to the energy supplier 

sdge procures natural gas under shortterm contracts for its owned generation facilities and for certain tolling contracts associated with purchasedpower arrangements purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

sdge is a participant in the western systems power pool which includes an electricpower and transmissionrate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities power agencies energy brokers and power marketers located throughout the us and canada participants can make power transactions on standardized terms including marketbased rates preapproved by the ferc participation in the western systems power pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk 

customers and demand sdge provides electric services through the generation transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes 



1 includes intercompany sales 

san diego’s mild climate and sdge’s robust energy efficiency programs contribute to lower consumption by our customers rooftop solar installations continue to reduce residential and commercial volumes sold by sdge at december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the residential and commercial rooftop solar capacity in sdge’s territory totaled 1423 mw 1233 mw and 1023 mw respectively 

demand for electricity is dependent on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products consumer preference environmental regulations legislation renewable power generation the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs demandside management impact and distributed generation resources california’s energy policy supports 

increased electrification particularly electrification of vehicles which could result in significant increases in sales volumes in the coming years other external factors such as the price of purchased power the use of hydroelectric power the use of and further development of renewable energy resources and energy storage development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in the market price of electricity which may in turn impact demand demand for electricity is also impacted by seasonal weather patterns or “seasonality” tending to increase in the summer months to meet cooling load and in the winter months to meet heating load 

competition sdge faces competition to serve its customer load from the growth in distributed and local power generation including rooftop solar installations and battery storage and the corresponding decrease in demand for power from departing retail load from customers transferring to load serving entities other than sdge while sdge currently provides procurement service for the majority of its customer load customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than sdge through programs such as da and cca da is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours and cca is only available if the customer’s local jurisdiction city offers such a program several local jurisdictions including the city and county of san diego and other municipalities have implemented are implementing or are considering implementing cca which could result in sdge providing procurement service for less than half of its current customer load as early as december 31 2021 when customers are served by another load serving entity sdge no longer procures electricity for this departing load and the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources could then be borne by sdge’s remaining bundled procurement customers to help achieve the goal of ratepayer indifference whether or not customers are served by da or cca the cpuc revised the power charge indifference adjustment framework by adopting several refinements designed to equitably share costs among customers served by sdge and customers served by da and cca which sdge implemented on january 1 2019 

natural gas utility operations 

we describe sdge’s natural gas utility operations below in “california utilities’ natural gas utility operations” 

socalgas 

socalgas is a regulated public utility that owns and operates a natural gas distribution transmission and storage system that supplies natural gas to a population of at december 31 2020 approximately 22 million covering a 24000 square mile service territory that encompasses southern california and portions of central california excluding san diego county the city of long beach and the desert area of san bernardino county 

socalgas’ assets at december 31 2020 covered the following territory 

natural gas utility operations 

we describe socalgas’ natural gas utility operations below in “california utilities’ natural gas utility operations” 

california utilities ’ natural gas utility operations 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

at december 31 2020 socalgas’ natural gas facilities included 3059 miles of transmission and storage pipelines 51367 miles of distribution pipelines 48492 miles of service pipelines and nine transmission compressor stations and sdge’s natural gas facilities consisted of 178 miles of transmission pipelines 8971 miles of distribution pipelines 6615 miles of service pipelines and one compressor station 

socalgas purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the california utilities’ core customers socalgas purchases natural gas from various sources including from canada the us rockies and the southwestern regions of the us purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

to support the delivery of natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights energy companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas from outside of california and its transportation customers 

natural gas storage 

socalgas owns four natural gas storage facilities with a combined working gas capacity of 137 bcf and over 150 injection withdrawal and observation wells that provide natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers socalgas’ and sdge’s core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas’ storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others including sdge for its noncore customer requirements natural gas withdrawn from storage is important to help maintain service reliability during peak demand periods including consumer heating needs in the winter as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility has a storage capacity of 86 bcf and subject to the cpuc limitations described below represents 63 of socalgas’ natural gas storage capacity socalgas 

discovered a natural gas leak at one of its wells at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in october 2015 and permanently sealed the well in february 2016 socalgas was subsequently authorized to make limited withdrawals and injections of natural gas at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and has been directed by the cpuc to maintain up to 34 bcf of working gas at the facility to help achieve reliability for the region at reasonable rates as determined by the cpuc to help maintain system reliability the cpuc issued a protocol authorizing withdrawals of natural gas from the facility if available gas supply and gas prices reach defined thresholds for socalgas’ system as determined by the protocol we discuss the leak in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part i – item 1a risk factors” and in “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – socalgas” 

customers and demand 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers in its territory and sdge’s territory on a combined portfolio basis socalgas also offers natural gas transportation and storage services for others 



1   includes intercompany sales 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the california utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers 

noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale and large commercial and industrial customers a portion of socalgas’ noncore customers are nonendusers socalgas’ nonendusers include wholesale customers consisting primarily of other utilities including sdge or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers 

noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements as the regulatory framework does not allow us to recover the cost of natural gas procured and delivered to noncore customers 

demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products consumer preference environmental regulations legislation california’s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs other external factors such as weather the price of and demand for electricity the use of hydroelectric power the use of and further development of renewable energy resources and energy storage development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas outside 

california and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price which may in turn impact demand 

one of the larger sources for natural gas demand is electric generation natural gasfired electric generation within southern california and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity growth in selfgeneration from rooftop solar the addition of more efficient gas technologies new energy efficiency initiatives and the degree to which regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the california utilities’ respective service areas the demand for natural gas may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to seasonality weather conditions and other impacts and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources given the significant quantity of natural gasfired generation we believe natural gas is a dispatchable fuel that can help provide electric reliability in our california service territories 

the natural gas distribution business is subject to seasonality and cash provided by operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry but subject to current regulatory limitations socalgas usually injects natural gas into storage during the summer months april through october which reduces cash provided by operating activities during this period and usually withdraws natural gas from storage during the winter months november through march cash provided by operating activities during the winter months generally increases when customer demand is higher 

sempra texas utilities 

sempra texas utilities is comprised of our equity method investments in oncor holdings which we acquired in march 2018 and sharyland holdings which we acquired in may 2019 we discuss these acquisitions in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements oncor holdings which is an indirect wholly owned entity of sempra energy owns an 8025 interest in oncor tti owns the remaining 1975 interest in oncor sempra energy owns an indirect 50 interest in sharyland holdings which owns a 100 interest in sharyland utilities 

sempra texas utilities’ assets at december 31 2020 covered the following territory 

oncor 

oncor is a regulated electric transmission and distribution utility that operates in the northcentral eastern western and panhandle regions of texas oncor delivers electricity to enduse consumers through its transmission and distribution systems and also provides transmission grid connections to merchant generation facilities and interconnections to other transmission grids in texas 

at december 31 2020 oncor had 4396 employees including 767 employees under collective bargaining agreements 

certain ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments which we describe in “part i – item 1a risk factors” are in effect and are intended to enhance oncor holdings’ and oncor’s separateness from their owners and to mitigate the risk that these entities would be negatively impacted by the bankruptcy of or other adverse financial developments affecting their owners sempra energy does not control oncor holdings or oncor and the ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to direct the management policies and operations of oncor holdings and oncor including the deployment or disposition of their assets declarations of dividends strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions including limited representation on the oncor holdings and oncor boards of directors because oncor holdings and oncor are managed independently ie ringfenced we account for our 100 ownership interest in oncor holdings as an equity method investment see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our equity method investment in oncor holdings 

electricity transmission oncor’s electricity transmission business is responsible for the safe and reliable operations of its transmission network and substations these responsibilities consist of the construction and maintenance of transmission facilities and substations and the monitoring controlling and dispatching of highvoltage electricity over its transmission facilities in coordination with ercot which we discuss below in “regulation – utility regulation – ercot market” 

at december 31 2020 oncor’s transmission system included approximately 18127 circuit miles of transmission lines 336 transmission stations and 806 distribution substations which are interconnected to 115 generation facilities totaling 41986 mw 

transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by either the puct or to a small degree related to limited interconnection to other markets the ferc network transmission revenues compensate oncor for delivery of electricity over transmission facilities operating at 60 kv and above other services offered by oncor through its transmission business include system impact studies facilities studies transformation service and maintenance of transformer equipment substations and transmission lines owned by other parties 

electricity distribution oncor’s electricity distribution business is responsible for the overall safe and reliable operation of distribution facilities including electricity delivery power quality and system reliability these responsibilities consist of the ownership management construction maintenance and operation of the electricity distribution system within its certificated service area oncor’s distribution system receives electricity from the transmission system through substations and distributes electricity to endusers and wholesale customers through 3660 distribution feeders 

oncor’s distribution system included more than 37 million points of delivery at december 31 2020 and consisted of 121129 miles of overhead and underground lines 

distribution revenues from residential and small business users are based on actual monthly consumption kwh and distribution revenues from large commercial and industrial users are based on depending on size and annual load factor either actual monthly demand kw or the greater of actual monthly demand kw or 80 of peak monthly demand during the prior eleven months 

customers and demand oncor operates the largest transmission and distribution system in texas oncor delivers electricity to more than 37 million homes and businesses in a territory with an estimated population in excess of 10 million and operates more than 139000 miles of transmission and distribution lines at december 31 2020 the consumers of the electricity oncor delivers are free to choose their electricity supplier from retail electric providers who compete for their business accordingly oncor is not a seller of electricity nor does it purchase electricity for resale rather oncor provides transmission services to its electricity distribution business as well as nonaffiliated electricity distribution companies cooperatives and municipalities and distribution services to retail electric providers that sell electricity to retail customers at december 31 2020 oncor’s distribution customers consisted of approximately 95 retail electric providers and certain electric cooperatives in its certificated service area 

oncor’s transmission and distribution assets are located in over 120 counties and more than 400 incorporated municipalities including dallasfort worth and surrounding suburbs waco wichita falls odessa midland tyler temple killeen and round rock among others most of oncor’s power lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways streets and rightsofway as permitted by law 

oncor’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other electricity usage drivers with revenues being highest in the summer 

competition oncor operates in certificated areas designated by the puct the majority of oncor’s service territory is single certificated with oncor as the only certificated electric transmission and distribution provider however in multicertificated areas of texas oncor competes with certain other utilities and rural electric cooperatives for the right to serve enduse customers

sempra mexico 

our sempra mexico segment includes the operating companies of our subsidiary ienova as well as certain holding companies and risk management activities ienova develops owns and operates or holds interests in energy infrastructure in mexico in three key energy markets gas power and storage ienova’s gas business includes pipeline services for natural gas and ethane and associated or standalone compression assets as well as its natural gas marketing business and natural gas distribution business in its power business ienova operates a naturalgasfired combinedcycle power plant and wind and solar power generation facilities and is constructing and developing additional wind and solar power generation facilities ienova’s storage business includes refined products storage its lpg storage and pipeline systems and its eca regas facility currently ienova is constructing and developing marine and land terminals for the receipt storage and delivery of liquid fuels 

sempra energy beneficially owned 702 of ienova at december 31 2020 with the remaining shares held by nci and traded on the mexican stock exchange under the symbol ienova the cnbv regulates the shares which are registered with the mexican national securities registry registro nacional de valores maintained by the cnbv on december 2 2020 we announced a nonbinding offer to acquire all outstanding publicly held shares of ienova in exchange for shares of our common stock at a rate of 00313 shares of our common stock for each one ienova ordinary share which exchange ratio remains subject to approval by the sempra energy board of directors and if successful would increase sempra energy’s ownership interest in ienova to 100 assuming that all ienova public shareholders tender their shares on december 1 2020 we filed an application with the cnbv and on january 12 2021 we filed a registration statement with the sec in each case in connection with the exchange offer as part of the exchange offer sempra energy intends to list its common stock on the mexican stock exchange we expect to complete this transaction in the second quarter of 2021 subject to authorization by the sec cnbv and mexican stock exchange and other closing conditions the proposed exchange offer is subject to a number of risks that are discussed in “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

at december 31 2020 sempra mexico’s assets covered the following territory 

gas business 

pipelines and related assets at december 31 2020 ienova’s pipeline and related assets consisted of 1850 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines 15 natural gas compression stations two of which are under construction and 139 miles of ethane pipelines in mexico these pipeline assets had design capacity of over 16400 mmcf per day of natural gas 204 mmcf per day of ethane gas and 106000 barrels per day of ethane liquid ienova’s pipeline and related assets are contracted under longterm us dollarbased agreements with major industry participants such as the cfe cenagas pemex shell mexico gazprom saavi energía and other similar counterparties 

natural gas distribution ienova’s natural gas distribution regulated utility ecogas operates in three separate distribution zones in mexico with approximately 2729 miles of pipeline and had approximately 136000 customer meters serving more than 441000 residential commercial and industrial consumers with sales volume of approximately eight mmcf per day in 2020 

ecogas relies on supply and transportation services from sempra lng and socalgas for the natural gas it distributes to its customers if these affiliates fail to perform and ecogas is unable to obtain supplies of natural gas from alternate sources ecogas could lose customers and sales volume and could also be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility 

natural gas marketing ienova’s natural gas marketing business ienova marketing s de rl de cv ienova marketing purchases lng for storage and regasification at the eca regas facility and sells natural gas to affiliates and thirdparty customers this business also purchases natural gas from sempra energy affiliates in order to sell it to ienova customers in baja california including the cfe which purchases such natural gas to power its plants in rosarito baja california and ienova’s tdm combinedcycle power plant ienova marketing also supplies natural gas purchased from sempra energy affiliates to thirdparty industrial customers in mexicali chihuahua torreón and durango at december 31 2020 ienova marketing served over 150 customers 

power business 

renewable power generation ienova develops invests in and operates renewable energy generation facilities that have longterm ppas to sell the electricity they generate to their customers which are generally load serving entities as well as industrial and other customers load serving entities sell electric service to their endusers and wholesale customers upon receipt of power delivery from these energy generation facilities while industrial and other customers consume the electricity to run their facilities at december 31 2020 ienova had a fully contracted total nameplate capacity of 1041 mw related to its wind and solar power generation facilities that were either fully operating or under construction some of these facilities are impacted by regulatory actions by the mexican government and related litigation which we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 



1 includes 100 of the nameplate capacity in which ienova owns a 50 interest 

2 we expect to start commercial operations in late 2021 or in the first quarter of 2022 

3 two adjacent wind power generation facilities 

4 we expect to start commercial operations in the first half of 2021 

natural gasfired generation tdm is a 625mw natural gasfired power plant located in mexicali baja california mexico that generates revenue from selling electricity andor resource adequacy to the california iso and to governmental public utility and wholesale power marketing entities it also has an ema with sempra lng for energy marketing scheduling and other related services to support its sales of generated power into the california electricity market under the ema tdm pays fees to sempra lng for these revenuegenerating services tdm also purchases fuel from sempra lng ienova records revenue for the sale of power generated by tdm and records cost of sales for the purchases of natural gas and energy management services provided by sempra lng 

storage business 

lng regasification ienova operates its eca regas facility in baja california mexico the eca regas facility is capable of processing one bcf of natural gas per day and has a storage capacity of 320000 cubic meters in two tanks of 160000 cubic meters each the facility generates revenues from reservation and usage fees under terminal capacity agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with shell mexico and gazprom expiring in 2028 that permit them together to use onehalf of the terminal’s capacity the land on which the eca regas facility is situated is the subject of litigation and shell mexico and gazprom have commenced binding arbitration to terminate these agreements and seek other relief both of which we discuss in note 16 of the 

notes to consolidated financial statements in “part i – item 1a risk factors” and in “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity” 

sempra lng has an agreement with ienova to supply lng to the eca regas facility in connection with sempra lng’s purchase agreement with tangguh psc ienova purchases from sempra lng the lng delivered by tangguh psc to the eca regas facility ienova uses the natural gas produced from this lng and natural gas purchased in the market or through sempra lng’s marketing operations to supply a contract for the sale of natural gas to the cfe at prices that are based on the socal border index if lng volumes received from tangguh psc are not sufficient to satisfy the commitment to the cfe ienova may purchase natural gas from sempra lng’s marketing operations 

although the lng purchase agreement with tangguh psc specifies a number of cargoes to be delivered annually actual cargoes delivered have been significantly lower than the maximum specified under the agreement as a result sempra lng is contractually required to make monthly indemnity payments to ienova for failure to deliver the contracted lng 

ienova entered into an agreement to assign its contracted capacity at the eca regas facility to eca lng phase 1 both parties will make use of the capacity through the expiration of the lng purchase agreement with tangguh psc in 2029 and eca lng phase 1 will be the sole user of this capacity thereafter 

lpg storage and associated systems ienova owns and operates the tdf s de r l de c v tdf pipeline system and the guadalajara lpg terminal at december 31 2020 the tdf pipeline system consisted of approximately 118 miles of a 12inch diameter lpg pipeline with a design capacity of 34000 barrels per day and associated storage and dispatch facilities the tdf pipeline system runs from pemex’s burgos facility in the state of tamaulipas to ienova’s delivery facility near the city of monterrey nuevo león ienova’s guadalajara lpg terminal is an 80000barrel lpg storage facility near guadalajara jalisco with associated loading and dispatch facilities and serves the lpg needs of guadalajara mexico 

refined products storage ienova’s refined products storage business develops systems for the receipt storage and delivery of refined products principally gasoline diesel and jet fuel throughout the states of baja california colima puebla sinaloa veracruz valle de méxico and jalisco for private companies at december 31 2020 ienova had marine and inland terminals under development and construction with a projected storage capacity of approximately 8000000 barrels which may be expanded we expect the inland terminals in the vicinity of mexico city and puebla and the veracruz and topolobampo marine terminals to reach commercial operations in various dates in 2021 

demand and competition 

ienova competes with mexican and foreign companies for certain new energy infrastructure projects in mexico some of its competitors including public or stateoperated companies and their affiliates may have better access to capital and greater financial and other resources which could give them a competitive advantage in bidding for such projects 

ecogas faces competition from other distributors of natural gas in each of its three distribution zones in mexicali chihuahua and la lagunadurango as other distributors of natural gas build or consider building natural gas distribution systems ienova’s pipeline and storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated pipeline and storage facilities they compete primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets 

the overall demand for natural gas distribution services increases during the winter months while the overall demand for power increases during the summer months 

generation from ienova’s renewable energy assets is susceptible to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind inclement weather and hours of sunlight because ienova sells power that it generates at its esj wind power generation facility into california ienova’s future performance and the demand for renewable energy may be impacted by us state mandated requirements to deliver a portion of total energy load from renewable energy sources the rules governing these requirements in california are generally known as the rps program in california certification of a generation project by the cec as an err allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements if such purchase meets the provisions of sb x12 the california renewable energy resources act the rps program may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by ienova particularly the demand from california’s utilities we expect to pursue err certification for all our ienova renewable facilities providing power to california as they become operational 

tdm competes daily with other generating plants that supply power into the california electricity market several of the wholesale markets supplied by merchant power plants have experienced significant pricing declines due to the imbalance between 

supply and demand ienova manages commodity price risk at tdm by using a mix of day ahead sales of energy energy spreads hedging ancillary services and shortterm to mediumterm capacity sales 

the lng regasification business is impacted by worldwide lng market prices high lng prices in markets outside the market in which ienova’s eca regas facility operates have resulted and could continue to result in lower than expected deliveries of lng cargoes to the eca regas facility which could increase costs if ienova is instead required to obtain lng in the open market at prevailing prices any inability to obtain expected lng cargoes could also impact ienova’s ability to maintain the minimum level of lng required to keep the eca regas facility in operation at the proper temperature prices in international lng markets through which ienova must purchase natural gas to meet its contractual obligations to deliver natural gas to customers may also affect ienova marketing’s operations which could have an adverse impact on its earnings but may be mitigated in part by the indemnity payments from sempra lng 

sempra lng 

sempra lng develops builds operates and invests in natural gas liquefaction export facilities including natural gas pipelines and infrastructure and buys sells and transports natural gas through its marketing operations all within north america 

at december 31 2020 sempra lng owned or held interests in the following assets 

natural gas liquefaction 

cameron lng jv sempra lng and three project coowners total se mitsui  co ltd and japan lng investment llc a company jointly owned by mitsubishi corporation and nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha hold interests in cameron lng jv which owns and operates a threetrain natural gas liquefaction export facility phase 1 in hackberry louisiana sempra lng accounts for its 502 equity interest in cameron lng jv under the equity method 

cameron lng jv achieved commercial operations of train 1 train 2 and train 3 in phase 1 under its tolling agreements in august 2019 february 2020 and august 2020 respectively the three liquefaction trains have a combined nameplate capacity of 139 mtpa of lng with an export capacity of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf per day cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of total se mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd which subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the three trains at the facility we discuss cameron lng jv in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

eca lng phase 1 sempra lng ienova and an affiliate of total se hold interests in eca lng phase 1 which is constructing a onetrain natural gas liquefaction facility at the site of ienova’s existing eca regas facility in baja california mexico with a nameplate capacity of 325 mtpa we reached a final investment decision in november 2020 eca lng phase 1 has a definitive 20year lng sale and purchase agreement with mitsui  co ltd and an affiliate of total se for approximately 08 mtpa of lng and 17 mtpa of lng respectively 

additional potential lng export projects sempra lng is evaluating the following additional potential lng export development opportunities 

▪ an expansion of cameron lng jv’s liquefaction export facility phase 2 

▪ a natural gas liquefaction export project by eca lng phase 2 also located at the site of ienova’s existing eca regas facility in baja california mexico 

▪ a natural gas liquefaction export project port arthur lng and associated infrastructure on a greenfield site in the vicinity of port arthur texas located along the sabineneches waterway 

we have not reached a final investment decision for any of these potential projects the development of these projects is subject to numerous other risks and uncertainties for a discussion of these proposed projects and their risks see “part i – item 1a risk factors” and “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – sempra lng” 

midstream 

sempra lng has a 40mile natural gas pipeline in south louisiana the cameron interstate pipeline links the cameron lng jv facility in cameron parish in louisiana to five interstate pipelines that offer access to major feed gas supply basins in texas and the northeast midcontinent and southeast regions of the us 

marketing operations 

sempra lng provides natural gas marketing trading and risk management services through the utilization and optimization of natural gas supply and transportation including natural gas transport capacity in support of liquefaction projects in development additionally it sells electricity under shortterm and longterm contracts and into the spot market and other competitive markets 

sempra lng’s marketing operations have an lng sale and purchase agreement with tangguh psc for the supply of the equivalent of 500 mmcf of natural gas per day from tangguh psc’s indonesian liquefaction facility with delivery to ienova’s eca regas facility at a price based on the socal border index for natural gas the lng purchase agreement allows tangguh psc to divert certain lng volumes to other global markets in exchange for cash differential payments to sempra lng sempra lng may also enter into shortterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified at the eca regas facility for sale to other parties 

sempra lng is contracted to sell lng or if deliveries of lng cargoes are not sufficient natural gas to sempra mexico that allows sempra mexico to satisfy its obligation under supply agreements with the cfe tdm and other customers these revenues are adjusted for indemnity payments and profit sharing as discussed in “sempra mexico – storage business – lng regasification” above 

sempra lng also has an ema with sempra mexico’s tdm to provide energy marketing scheduling and other related services to tdm power plant to support tdm’s sales of generated power into the california electricity market we discuss the ema in “sempra mexico – power business – natural gasfired generation” above 

demand and competition 

north america is one of the most competitive locations for potential lng supply in the world resulting from many factors including 

▪ high levels of developed and undeveloped north american unconventional natural gas and tight oil resources relative to domestic consumption levels 

▪ increasing gas and oil drilling productivity and decreasing unit costs of gas production 

▪ low breakeven prices of marginal north american unconventional gas production 

▪ proximity to ample existing gas transmission pipeline and underground gas storage capacity 

brownfield liquefaction is particularly competitive due to existing lng tankage and berths 

global lng competition may limit north american lng exports as international liquefaction projects attempt to match north american lng production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility it is expected that north american lng exports will increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand and thereby facilitate development of a global commodity market for natural gas and lng 

additionally our cameron lng jv coowners and customers compete globally to market and sell lng to end users including gas and electric utilities located in lngimporting countries around the world by providing liquefaction services cameron lng jv competes indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global lng market in addition to the us these competitors are located in the middle east southeast asia africa south america australia and europe 

sempra lng’s pipeline business competes with other regulated and unregulated pipelines primarily on the basis of price in terms of transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets 

discontinued operations 

in january 2019 our board of directors approved a plan to sell our south american businesses these businesses included our former 100 interest in chilquinta energía an electric distribution utility in chile our former 836 interest in luz del sur an electric distribution utility in peru and our former interests in two energyservices companies tecnored and tecsur which provide electric construction and infrastructure services to chilquinta energía and luz del sur respectively as well as third parties these businesses and certain activities associated with these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in this report we completed the sales of our equity interests in our peruvian businesses in april 2020 and our chilean businesses in june 2020

utility regulation 

california 

the california utilities are principally regulated at the state level by the cpuc cec and carb 

the cpuc 

▪ consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for staggered sixyear terms 

▪ regulates among other things sdge’s and socalgas’ customer rates and conditions of service sales of securities rates of return capital structure rates of depreciation and longterm resource procurement except as described below in “us federal” 

▪ has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric generation transmission and distribution and natural gas storage transmission and distribution facilities in california 

▪ conducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines and conducts investigations related to various matters such as safety reliability and planning deregulation competition and the environment and 

▪ regulates the interactions and transactions of the california utilities with sempra energy and its other affiliates 

the cpuc also oversees and regulates other energyrelated products and services including solar and wind energy bioenergy alternative energy storage and other forms of renewable energy in addition the cpuc’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety and other violations 

the cec publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based on these forecasts the cec 

▪ determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs 

▪ sponsors alternativeenergy research and development projects 

▪ promotes energy conservation programs to reduce demand for natural gas and electricity within california 

▪ maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages and 

▪ certifies powerplant sites and related facilities within california 

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the california utilities’ longterm investment decisions 

california requires certain of its electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver a significant percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the rps program 

ab 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 assigns responsibility to carb for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing ghg emissions the law requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emissions reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a department within the california environmental protection agency an organization that reports directly to the governor’s office sempra lng and sempra mexico are also subject to the rules and regulations of carb 

the operation and maintenance of socalgas’ natural gas storage facilities are regulated by calgem as well as various other state and local agencies 

texas 

oncor’s and sharyland utilities’ rates are regulated at the state level by the puct and in the case of oncor at the city level by certain cities the puct has original jurisdiction over electric transmission and distribution rates and services in unincorporated areas and in those municipalities that have ceded original jurisdiction to the puct and has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review the rate and service orders and ordinances of municipalities generally the texas pura prohibits the collection of any rates or charges by a public utility as defined by pura that do not have the prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authority ie the puct or the municipality with original jurisdiction 

at the state level pura requires owners or operators of electric transmission facilities to provide openaccess wholesale transmission services to third parties at rates and terms that are nondiscriminatory and comparable to the rates and terms of the utility’s own use of its system the puct has adopted rules implementing the state openaccess requirements for all utilities that are subject to the puct’s jurisdiction over electric transmission services including oncor 

us federal 

the california utilities are also regulated at the federal level by the ferc the nrc the epa the doe and the dot 

the ferc regulates the california utilities’ interstate sale and transportation of natural gas in the case of sdge the ferc also regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access rates of return on transmission investment rates of depreciation electric rates involving sales for resale and the application of the uniform system of accounts the us energy policy act governs procedures for requests for electric transmission service the california ious’ electric transmission facilities are under the operational control of the california iso oncor and sharyland utilities operate within the ercot market which we discuss below to a small degree related to limited interconnections to other markets oncor’s electric transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by the ferc 

the nrc oversees the licensing construction operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities in the us including songs in which sdge owns a 20 interest and which was permanently retired in 2013 nrc and various state regulations require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities we provide further discussion of songs matters including the closure and decommissioning of the facility in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the epa implements federal laws to protect human health and the environment including federal laws on air quality water quality wastewater discharge solid waste management and hazardous waste disposal and remediation the epa also sets national environmental standards that state and tribal governments implement through their own regulations the california utilities oncor and sharyland utilities are therefore subject to an interrelated framework of environmental laws and regulations 

the dot through phmsa has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures applicable to the california utilities’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines as well as natural gas storage facilities the dot has certified the cpuc to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in california 

ercot market 

oncor and sharyland utilities operate within the ercot market which represents approximately 90 of the electricity consumption in texas ercot is the regional reliability coordinating organization for member electricity systems in texas and the iso of the interconnected transmission grid for those systems ercot is subject to oversight by the puct and the texas legislature ercot is responsible for ensuring reliability adequacy and security of the electric systems as well as nondiscriminatory access to transmission service by all wholesale market participants in the ercot region ercot’s membership consists of corporate and associate members including electric cooperatives municipal power agencies independent generators independent power marketers transmission service providers distribution services providers independent retail electric providers and consumers 

the puct has primary jurisdiction over the ercot market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of power supply across texas’ main interconnected electric transmission grid oncor and sharyland utilities along with other owners of electric transmission and distribution facilities in texas assist the ercot iso in its operations each of these texas utilities has planning design construction operation and maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and for the loadserving substations it owns primarily within its certificated distribution service area each participates with the ercot iso and other ercot utilities in obtaining regulatory approvals and planning designing constructing and upgrading transmission lines in order to remove any existing constraints and interconnect energy generation on the ercot transmission grid these transmission line projects are necessary to meet reliability needs support energy production and increase bulk power transfer capability 

oncor and sharyland utilities are subject to reliability standards adopted and enforced by the texas reliability entity inc an independent organization that develops reliability standards for the ercot region and monitors and enforces compliance with the standards of the north american electric reliability corporation including critical infrastructure protection and ercot protocols

▪ marketbased for wholesale electricity sales 

▪ costbased for the transportation of natural gas and 

▪ marketbased for the purchase and sale of lng and natural gas 

sempra lng’s investment in cameron lng jv is subject to regulations of the doe regarding the export of lng sempra lng’s other potential natural gas liquefaction export projects would if completed be subject to similar regulation 

the california utilities sempra lng and businesses that sempra lng invests in are subject to the dot rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety phmsa acting through the office of pipeline safety is responsible for administering the dot’s national regulatory program to help ensure the safe transportation of natural gas petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines including pipelines associated with natural gas storage and develops regulations and other approaches to risk management to help ensure safety in design construction testing operation maintenance and emergency response of pipeline facilities the california utilities sempra lng and sempra mexico are also subject to regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission 

foreign regulation 

operations and projects in our sempra mexico segment are subject to regulation by the cre the mexican safety energy and environment agency agencia de seguridad energía y ambiente sener the mexican ministry of environment and natural resources of mexico secretaría del medio ambiente y recursos naturales and other labor and environmental agencies of city state and federal governments in mexico new energy infrastructure projects may also require a favorable opinion from cofece in order to be constructed and operated 

licenses and permits 

our utilities in california and texas obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses for as applicable the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets including electric generation and natural gas storage facilities some of which may require periodic renewal 

sempra mexico obtains numerous permits authorizations and licenses for its electric and natural gas distribution generation and transmission systems from the local governments where these services are provided the permits for generation transportation storage and distribution operations at sempra mexico are generally for 30year terms with options for renewal under certain regulatory conditions 

sempra mexico and sempra lng obtain licenses and permits for the construction operation and expansion of lng facilities and for the import and export of lng and natural gas sempra mexico also obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of facilities for the receipt storage and delivery of liquid fuels 

sempra lng obtains permits authorizations and licenses for the construction and operation of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines and in connection with participation in the wholesale electricity market 

most of the permits and licenses associated with sempra lng’s construction and operations are for periods generally in alignment with the construction cycle or expected useful life of the asset and in many cases are greater than 20 years 

ratemaking mechanisms 

california utilities 

general rate case proceedings 

a cpuc grc proceeding is designed to set sufficient base rates to allow the california utilities to recover their reasonable forecasted operating costs and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investment the proceeding generally establishes the test year revenue requirements which authorizes how much the california utilities can collect from their customers and provides for attrition or annual increases in revenue requirements for each year following the test year 

we discuss the grc in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cost of capital proceedings 

a cpuc cost of capital proceeding determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base which is a weightedaverage of the authorized returns on debt preferred stock and common equity referred to as return on equity or roe weighted on a basis consistent with the authorized capital structure the authorized return on rate base approved by the cpuc is the rate that the california utilities use to establish customer rates to finance investments in cpucregulated electric distribution and generation natural gas distribution transmission and storage assets as well as general plant and information technology systems investments to support operations 

a cost of capital proceeding also addresses the ccm which considers changes in interest rates based on the applicable 12month average moody’s utility bond index the index applicable to each utility is based on each utility’s credit rating the ccm was reauthorized in the 2020 cost of capital proceeding and will continue through 2022 after which the ccm is subject to reauthorization in the next cost of capital proceeding the ccm benchmark rates for sdge and socalgas are the basis of comparison to determine if future measurement periods “trigger” the ccm the trigger occurs if the change in the applicable average moody’s utility bond index relative to the ccm benchmark is larger than plus or minus 100 bps the ccm if triggered would automatically update the authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and update the authorized roe upward or downward by onehalf of the difference between the ccm benchmark and the applicable 12month average moody’s utility bond index in the event of a ccm trigger in 2021 the ccm benchmark is also reestablished and these adjustments would become effective in authorized rates on january 1 2022 

we discuss the cost of capital and ccm in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

transmission rate cases 

sdge files separately with the ferc for its authorized roe on fercregulated electric transmission operations and assets the proceeding establishes a roe and a formulaic rate whereby rates are determined using 1 a base period of historical costs and a forecast of capital investments and 2 a trueup period similar to balancing account treatment that is designed to provide earnings equal to sdge’s actual cost of service including its authorized return on investment sdge makes annual information filings with the ferc in december to update rates for the following calendar year sdge may also file for roe incentives that might apply under ferc rules sdge’s debttoequity ratio is set annually based on the actual ratio at the end of each year 

we discuss sdge’s to5 filing with the ferc in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

incentive mechanisms 

the cpuc applies certain performancebased measures and incentive mechanisms to all california ious under which the california utilities have earnings potential above authorized cpuc base operating margin if they achieve or exceed specific performance and operating goals generally for performancebased awards if performance is above or below specific benchmarks the utility is eligible for financial awards or subject to financial penalties 

other costbased recovery 

the cpuc and the ferc as it relates to sdge authorize the california utilities to collect revenue requirements from customers for operating costs and capital related costs such as depreciation taxes and return on rate base including 

▪ costs to purchase natural gas and electricity 

▪ costs associated with administering public purpose demand response and customer energy efficiency programs 

▪ other programmatic activities such as gas distribution gas transmission gas storage integrity management and wildfire mitigation and 

▪ costs associated with thirdparty liability insurance premiums 

authorized costs are recovered as the commodity or service is delivered to the extent authorized amounts collected vary from actual costs the differences are generally recovered or refunded within a subsequent period based on the nature of the balancing account mechanism in general the revenue recognition criteria for balanced costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred because these costs are substantially recovered in rates through a balancing account mechanism changes in these costs are reflected as changes in revenues the cpuc and the ferc may impose various review procedures before authorizing recovery or refund for programs authorized including limitations on the total cost of the program revenue requirement limits or reviews of costs for reasonableness these procedures could result in disallowances of recovery from ratepayers

rates and cost recovery 

oncor’s and sharyland utilities’ rates are each regulated at the state level by the puct and in the case of oncor at the city level by certain cities and are subject to regulatory ratesetting processes and annual earnings oversight this regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings levels instead their rates are regulated based on an analysis of each utility’s costs and capital structure as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital however there is no assurance that the puct will judge all of the texas utilities’ costs to have been prudently incurred that the puct will not reduce the amount of invested capital included in the capital structure upon which the texas utilities’ rates are based that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will necessarily result in rates that produce full recovery of the texas utilities’ costs or that their authorized roe will not be reduced 

the pura allows texas electric utilities providing wholesale or retail distribution service to file under certain circumstances once per year and up to four rate adjustments between comprehensive base rate proceedings to recover distributionrelated investments on an interim basis the puct’s substantive rules also allow the texas utilities to update their transmission rates periodically on an interim basis to reflect changes in invested capital these “capital tracker” provisions are intended to encourage investment in the electric system to help ensure reliability and efficiency by allowing for timely recovery of and return on new investments 

capital structure and return on equity 

oncor has a puctauthorized roe of 98 and an authorized regulatory capital structure of 575 debt to 425 equity sharyland utilities’ puctauthorized roe is 97 and its authorized regulatory capital structure is 55 debt to 45 equity sharyland utilities filed its 2020 rate case with the puct in december 2020 oncor is required to file a base rate review on or before october 1 2021

ecogas’ revenues are derived from service and distribution fees charged to its customers in mexican pesos the price ecogas pays to purchase natural gas which is based on international price indices is passed through directly to its customers the service and distribution fees charged by ecogas are regulated by the cre which performs a review of rates every five years and monitors prices charged to endusers in the fourth quarter of 2020 ecogas filed its rate case for the period 2021 through 2025 ecogas expects to receive a decision in 2021 the tariffs operate under a returnonassetbase model in the annual tariff adjustment rates are adjusted to account for inflation or fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation indexing includes separate us and mexican cost components so that us costs can be included in the final distribution rates 

environmental matters 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “part i – item 1a risk factors” you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions 

hazardous substances 

the cpuc’s hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allows california’s ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the california utilities to recover in rates 90 of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 of related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the california utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates 

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets 

air and water quality 

the natural gas and electric industries are subject to increasingly stringent air quality and ghg emissions standards such as those established by carb and scaqmd the california utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards we discuss ghg emissions standards and credits further in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

risks related to sempra energy 

operational and structural risks 

sempra energy’s cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and entities that are accounted for as equity method investments such as oncor holdings and cameron lng jv 

we are a holding company and substantially all our assets are owned by our subsidiaries or entities we do not control which include equity method investments such as oncor holdings and cameron lng jv our ability to pay dividends and to meet our debt and other obligations largely depends on cash flows from our subsidiaries and equity method investments cash flows from our subsidiaries and equity method investments depend on their ability to successfully execute their business strategies and generate cash flows in excess of their own expenditures common and preferred dividends if any and debt and other obligations in addition the entities accounted for as equity method investments which we do not control and our subsidiaries are all separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us and could be precluded from paying any such dividends or making any such loans or distributions under certain circumstances including among other things as a result of legislation regulation court order or contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress the inability to access capital from our subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

sempra energy’s rights to the assets of its subsidiaries and equity method investments are structurally subordinated to the claims of that entity’s creditors including trade creditors in addition to the extent sempra energy is a creditor of any such entity its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that entity and any indebtedness of the entity senior to that held by sempra energy 

sempra energy has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control 

we have and make investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control which include sempra energy’s direct or indirect interest in oncor cameron lng jv and rbs sempra commodities sdge’s interest in songs and ienova’s indirect interest in the sur de texastuxpan natural gas marine pipeline in mexico among others in some cases we engage in other arrangements with or for these entities that could expose us to risks in addition to our investment for example sempra energy has provided guarantees in support of financing agreements related to cameron lng jv sempra energy is subject to certain indemnities with respect to rbs sempra commodities and sempra mexico has provided loans to jvs in which it has investments we discuss the guarantees in note 6 indemnities in note 16 and affiliate loans in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

where we share control with other equity owners any disagreements among the owners of these businesses with respect to material issues including strategy financial operational or transactional matters could have a material adverse effect on the ability of that business to move forward with key initiatives or projects or take other actions and could also negatively affect the longterm relationships among the business owners and the ability of the entity to function efficiently and effectively any such circumstance could materially adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows result of operations andor prospects 

with respect to ventures and other businesses over which we do not exercise control we could be responsible for significant liabilities or losses related to these businesses such as our investment in rbs sempra commodities where we recorded 100 million in equity losses representing our estimated obligations to settle outstanding tax matters and related legal costs and where we could be subject to further losses upon final resolution of these matters in addition to other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses business decisions were made with which we do not agree or other factors were to result in liabilities or losses at these entities it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we discuss our investments further in notes 5 6 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders 

activist shareholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management in taking these steps activist shareholders could seek to acquire significant amounts of our capital stock which could threaten our ability to use some or all our nol carryforwards if any such attempt were to result in our corporation undergoing an “ownership change” under applicable tax rules responding to activist shareholders would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees proxy solicitation expenses in 

the case of a proxy contest and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy 

any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control our ability to execute on our strategy or the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest or increased ownership or other interest in our company from activist shareholders could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which could be exploited by our competitors andor other activist shareholders result in the loss of business opportunities and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results andor prospects further any such actions could cause significant fluctuations in the trading prices of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that may not reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

financial and capital stockrelated risks 

any impairment of our assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

we could experience a reduction in the fair value of our assets including our longlived assets intangible assets or goodwill upon the occurrence of many of the risks discussed in these risk factors any such reduction in the fair value of our assets could result in an impairment loss that could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which such charge is recorded we discuss our impairment testing of longlived assets and goodwill and the factors considered in such testing in “part ii – item 7 mda – critical accounting policies and estimates” and in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the economic interest voting rights and market value of our outstanding common and preferred stock may be adversely affected by any additional equity securities we may issue and with respect to our common stock by our outstanding preferred stock 

at february 25 2021 we have 6650000 shares of preferred stock outstanding 5750000 of which constitute our series b preferred stock and are scheduled to convert into shares of our common stock on july 15 2021 and the remaining 900000 of which constitute our series c preferred stock and are not convertible we also issued 13781025 shares of our common stock on january 15 2021 upon the mandatory conversion of our former series a preferred stock in accordance with the terms of those securities we may seek to raise capital by issuing additional shares of common or preferred stock which together with the conversion of the series b preferred stock into our common stock may materially dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our outstanding common and preferred stock and materially adversely affect the trading price of our common and preferred stock 

dividend requirements associated with our preferred stock subject us to certain risks 

any future cash dividends we pay on our series b preferred stock and series c preferred stock will depend on among other things our financial condition capital requirements and results of operations the ability of our subsidiaries and equity method investees to distribute cash to us and other factors that our board of directors may consider relevant any failure to pay scheduled dividends on our preferred stock when due would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our preferred stock our common stock and our debt securities and would prohibit us under the terms of our preferred stock from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of our common stock subject to limited exceptions until such time as we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock 

the terms of the series b preferred stock and series c preferred stock generally provide that if dividends on any shares of the preferred stock have not been declared and paid or have been declared but not paid for six or more quarterly dividend periods for the series b preferred stock and three or more semiannual dividend periods for the series c preferred stock whether or not for consecutive dividend periods the holders of the preferred stock voting together as a single class will be entitled to elect a total of two additional members to our board of directors subject to certain terms and limitations 

risks related to all sempra energy businesses 

operational risks 

our businesses face risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic is materially impacting communities supply chains and markets around the world the us economy is experiencing a significant slowdown and claims for unemployment have substantially increased to date the covid19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our results of operations however we are conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel employee work locations and virtualization or cancellation of certain business activities among other modifications if these or other similar measures were to increase or continue for an extended period we could experience employee absenteeism decreased efficiency and productivity by our workforce and other similar impacts that could jeopardize our ability to sustain operations and satisfy compliance requirements and could result in higher operating costs we also have observed other companies including our current and prospective counterparties customers and partners as well as many governments including our regulators and other governing bodies that affect our businesses taking precautionary preemptive and responsive actions to address the effects of the covid19 pandemic and they may take further actions that alter their normal operations these actions by third parties could materially impact our operations results liquidity and ability to pursue capital projects and strategic initiatives for example the cpuc has required that all energy companies under its jurisdiction take action to implement several emergency customer protection measures to support california customers the measures currently apply to all residential and small business customers affected by the covid19 pandemic and include suspending service disconnections due to nonpayment waiving late payment fees and offering flexible payment plans to customers experiencing difficulty paying their electric or gas bills these actions have resulted in a reduction in payments received from our customers and an increase in uncollectible accounts which could become material and any inability or delay in recovering all or a substantial portion of these costs could have a material adverse effect on the cash flows financial condition and results of operations for sempra energy sdge and socalgas as an additional example we reached a final investment decision with respect to eca lng phase 1 in november 2020 the timing of which was delayed in part by the covid19 pandemic if this or other projects under development are further delayed due to continuing or worsening conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic or other related factors the performance and prospects of our lng export business could be materially adversely affected 

although sempra energy sdge and socalgas are not currently constrained in their ability to borrow money at reasonable rates these circumstances could change if the covid19 pandemic worsens or continues for an extended period and adversely affects conditions in the capital markets which could have a material negative effect on our liquidity results of operations strategic initiatives and prospects the covid19 pandemic could result in an increased slowdown of certain of our capital spending if conditions deteriorate or fail to improve in the near term which could have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s sdge’s and socalgas’ results of operations and prospects 

we will continue to actively monitor the effects of the covid19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers however we cannot at this time predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will further impact our liquidity financial condition results of operations and prospects 

severe weather conditions natural disasters pandemics accidents equipment failures explosions or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

like other capital intensive businesses our facilities and infrastructure may be damaged by severe weather conditions and natural disasters such as fires earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes other storms tsunamis heat waves rising sea levels floods mudslides drought solar events and electromagnetic events pandemics accidents equipment failures explosions or acts of terrorism vandalism war or criminality because we are in the business of using storing transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials as well as radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure as well as the risks to the surrounding communities for which we could be held responsible are substantially greater than the risks such incidents may pose to a typical business the facilities and infrastructure that we own or in which we have interests that may be subject to such incidents include among others 

▪ natural gas propane and ethane pipelines storage and compressor facilities 

▪ electric transmission distribution and battery storage equipment 

▪ power generation plants including renewable energy and natural gasfired generation 

▪ marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels lng and lpg facilities terminals and storage 

▪ nuclear power facilities and nuclear fuel and nuclear waste storage facilities through sdge’s minority interest in songs which is currently being decommissioned 

such incidents could result in severe business disruptions prolonged power outages property damage injuries or loss of life for which our businesses could be liable significant decreases in revenues and earnings andor other significant additional costs to us including as a result of higher maintenance costs or restoration expenses amounts to compensate third parties and regulatory 

fines penalties and disallowances for our regulated utilities these liabilities or increased costs may not be recoverable in rates such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners supply chains and transportation which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide natural gas and electricity to our customers moreover weatherrelated incidents have become more prevalent unpredictable and severe as a result of climate change or other factors and we are currently in the midst of a severe global pandemic any of which could have a greater impact on our businesses than is currently anticipated and for our regulated utilities rates may not be adequately or timely adjusted to reflect any such increased impact any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires natural gas natural gas odorant propane or ethane leaks releases of other ghg emissions radioactive releases explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties or personal injuries health impacts or fatalities or could present a nuisance to impacted communities any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us in some cases we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault such as in cases in which the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies we discuss how the application of this doctrine in california imposes strict liability on an electric utility whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire meaning the utility may be found liable regardless of fault below under “risks related to the california utilities – operational risks” insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become prohibitively expensive may be disputed by the insurers or may become unavailable for certain of these risks or at sufficient levels and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to the existence of limitations exclusions high deductibles failure to comply with procedural requirements and other factors which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects as well as the trading prices of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees 

several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a companybycompany basis any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

in addition to general information risks and cyber risks that all large corporations face eg malware general cyber or phishingattacks by outsiders malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information we face evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer and employee information smart grid infrastructure and natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure 

in the ordinary course of business sempra energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees customer energy usage and other information and our operations rely on complex interconnected networks of generation transmission distribution storage control and communication technologies and systems existing business technologies and the deployment of new business technologies represent a largescale opportunity for attacks on or other failures to protect our information systems and confidential information as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and our natural gas infrastructure in particular various private and public entities have noted that cyber and other attacks targeting utility systems and other energy infrastructures are increasing in sophistication magnitude and frequency additionally the california utilities are increasingly required to disclose large amounts of data including customer energy usage and personal information regarding customers to support changes to california’s electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice increasing the risks of inadvertent disclosure or other unauthorized access of sensitive information further the virtualization of many business activities as a result of the covid19 pandemic increases cyber risk and there generally has been an associated increase in targeted cyberattacks moreover all of our businesses operating in california are subject to enhanced state privacy laws that have recently taken effect which require companies that collect information on california residents to among other things make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provide a new cause of action for breaches of certain highly sensitive categories of personal information resulting from a failure to reasonably secure them and other states in which we do business could adopt similar laws in the future 

addressing cyber risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across sempra energy’s businesses including investing in risk management and information security measures for the protection of our systems and information the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing system protection measures are significant and they could materially increase to address increasingly intense complex and sophisticated cyber risks despite our efforts our businesses are not fully insulated from cyberattacks or system disruptions in addition we often rely on thirdparty vendors to deploy new business 

technologies and maintain modify and update our systems including systems that manage sensitive information and these third parties could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures with respect to these systems any attack on our information systems the integrity of the energy grid our pipelines and distribution and storage infrastructure or one of our facilities or unauthorized access damage or improper disclosure of confidential customer or employee information or other sensitive data could result in energy delivery service failures financial and reputational loss violations of privacy laws fines or penalties customer dissatisfaction and litigation any of which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects although sempra energy currently maintains cyber liability insurance this insurance is limited in scope and subject to exceptions conditions and coverage limitations and may not cover any or even a substantial portion of the costs associated with the consequences of any compromise of our information systems or confidential information and there is no guarantee that the insurance we currently maintain will continue to be available at rates that we believe are commercially reasonable 

further as seen with recent cyberattacks around the world the goal of a cyberattack may be primarily to inflict largescale harm on a company and the places where it operates any such cyberattack could cause widespread destruction of or disruption to our operating financial and administrative systems that could materially adversely affect our business operations and the integrity of the power grid our pipelines and distribution and storage infrastructure or one of our related facilities negatively impact our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements or comply with ongoing disclosure obligations or other regulatory requirements andor release confidential information about our company and our customers employees and other constituents any of which could lead to sanctions or negatively affect the general perception of our business in the financial markets and which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

financial risks 

the substantial debt service obligations of sempra energy sdge and socalgas could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects and with respect to sempra energy could require additional equity securities issuances 

the substantial debt service obligations of sempra energy sdge and socalgas could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects by among other things 

▪ making it more difficult and costly for each of these companies to service pay or refinance its debts as they become due particularly during adverse economic or industry conditions 

▪ limiting flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or react to changes in each of our businesses and the industry sectors in which they operate 

▪ requiring a substantial portion of available cash to be used for debt service payments including interest and potential redemptions thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital capital expenditures development projects acquisitions dividend payments and other general corporate purposes 

▪ causing lenders to require additional materially adverse terms conditions or covenants in the debt instruments for new debt which might include restrictions on uses of proceeds or other assets or limitations on the ability to incur additional debt create liens pay dividends redeem or repurchase stock make investments or receive distributions from subsidiaries or equity method investments 

sempra energy is committed to maintaining or improving its current credit ratings to maintain these credit ratings we may reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness with the proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock additional equity issuances may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of existing holders of sempra energy’s common and preferred stock there is no assurance that should we elect to do so we would be able to issue additional shares of sempra energy’s common or preferred stock with terms that we consider acceptable or at all or reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness to a level that allows us to maintain our investment grade credit ratings which may have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

the availability and cost of debt or equity financing could be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally as well as other factors and any such negative effects could materially adversely affect us  

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely on longterm debt to fund a significant portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a significant portion of daytoday business operations sempra energy may also seek to raise capital by issuing additional equity 

limitations on the availability of credit increases in interest rates or credit spreads or other negative effects on the terms of any debt or equity financing we may pursue could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments in difficult market environments we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support new or ongoing business activities this could cause us to reduce nonsafety related capital expenditures and could increase our cost of servicing debt both of which could significantly reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability 

other factors can affect the availability and cost of capital for our businesses in addition to the terms of debt and equity financing including among others 

▪ adverse changes to economic and financial market conditions and laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or do business 

▪ the overall health of the energy industry 

▪ volatility in natural gas or electricity prices 

▪ for sempra energy and sdge risks related to california wildfires and any failure by the state of california to adequately address the financial and operational wildfirerelated risks facing california electric ious 

▪ the deterioration of or uncertainty in the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in california 

▪ credit ratings downgrades 

we are subject to additional risks due to uncertainty relating to the calculation of libor and its scheduled discontinuance 

certain of our financial and commercial agreements including variable rate indebtedness and credit facilities as well as interest rate derivatives incorporate libor as a benchmark for establishing certain rates the financial conduct authority fca in the united kingdom which regulates libor has emphasized the need for market participants to transition away from libor ice benchmark administration libor’s administrator with the support of the fca has indicated it will cease publication of certain key us dollar libor tenors in mid2023 for existing loans additionally the us federal reserve has issued a statement advising banks to stop making new liborbased issuances by the end of 2021 these could cause libor to perform differently than it has performed historically pending any discontinuance or modification and after any modification the adoption of the secured overnight financing rate sofr which has been identified as the replacement benchmark rate for libor may result in interest payments that are higher than expected or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such indebtedness if the applicable libor rate was available in its current form changes to or the discontinuance of libor any further uncertainty regarding the implementation of such changes or discontinuance and uncertainties regarding the performance and characteristics of alternative benchmark rates could have a material adverse effect on our existing and future variable rate indebtedness andor borrowings our existing and future interest rate hedges and the cost of doing business under our commercial agreements that incorporate libor and could require us to seek to amend the terms of the relevant indebtedness or agreements which may be on terms materially worse than existing terms the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

certain credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place those ratings on negative outlook 

credit rating agencies routinely evaluate sempra energy and the california utilities and their ratings are based on a number of factors including the increased risk of wildfires in california perceived supportiveness of the regulatory environment affecting utility operations including delays and difficulties in obtaining recovery or the denial of recovery for wildfirerelated or other costs the deterioration of or uncertainty in the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in california ability to generate cash flows level of indebtedness overall financial strength including credit metrics specific transactions or events such as share repurchases diversification beyond the regulated utility business in the case of sempra energy and the status of certain capital projects as well as other factors beyond our control such as the state of the economy and our industry generally downgrades and factors causing downgrades of one or both of the california utilities can have a material impact on sempra energy’s credit ratings downgrades as well as the factors causing such downgrades of sempra energy’s credit ratings can also have a material impact on the credit ratings of the california utilities 

while the current moody’s sp and fitch collectively the rating agencies issuer credit ratings for sempra energy sdge and socalgas are investment grade some of these ratings have experienced downgrades or have been moved to negative outlook in 2020 and there is no assurance that these credit ratings will not be further downgraded in that regard sp has sempra energy sdge and socalgas on negative outlook and these negative outlooks could result in downgrades or other negative credit 

rating actions could occur at any time we discuss these credit ratings further in “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity” 

for sempra energy the rating agencies have noted that the following events among other things could lead to negative ratings actions 

▪ sempra energy’s failure to meet certain financial credit metrics 

▪ investing disproportionally in unregulated or uncontracted business and the impact on business mix and financial credit metrics over time 

▪ catastrophic wildfires caused by sdge or catastrophic wildfires caused by any california electric ious that participate in the wildfire fund which could exhaust the fund considerably earlier than expected 

▪ a ratings downgrade at sdge andor socalgas 

▪ continuing to acquire shares under a share repurchase program 

for sdge the rating agencies have noted that the following events among other things could lead to negative ratings actions 

▪ sdge’s failure to meet certain financial credit metrics 

▪ the cpuc does not effectively implement the more supportive prudency standard for determining wildfire liability associated with the wildfire legislation 

▪ catastrophic wildfires caused by sdge or catastrophic wildfires caused by any california electric ious that participate in the wildfire fund which could exhaust the fund considerably earlier than expected 

for socalgas the rating agencies have noted that the following events among other things could lead to negative ratings actions 

▪ socalgas’ failure to meet certain financial credit metrics 

▪ the conclusion of the cpuc’s pending regulatory proceedings where key elements of socalgas’ credit profile are negatively impacted 

▪ deterioration of or uncertainty in the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in california 

▪ a ratings downgrade at sempra energy 

a downgrade of sempra energy’s or either of the california utilities’ credit ratings or ratings outlooks as well as the reasons for such downgrades may materially and adversely affect the market prices of our equity and debt securities the interest rates at which borrowings are made and debt securities and commercial paper are issued and the various fees on credit facilities this could make it significantly more costly for sempra energy sdge socalgas and sempra energy’s other subsidiaries to borrow money to issue equity or debt securities and commercial paper and to raise other types of capital andor complete additional financings any of which could materially and adversely affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and meet our other debt obligations and contractual commitments and our cash flows results of operations andor financial condition 

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices and for those contract positions that are hedged our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the extent of the coverage to these exposures varies over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition certain of the contracts we may use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting which may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts in certain cases these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged 

risk management procedures may not prevent or mitigate losses  

although we have in place risk management and control systems to quantify and manage risk these systems may not prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended or may not work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are primarily based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate 

from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures and systems will prevent or mitigate losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

market performance or changes in other assumptions could require significant unplanned contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees a decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans in addition the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is affected by other factors including the assumed rate of return on plan assets mortality tables employee demographics discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations rates of increase in health care costs levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation an adverse change in any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

legal and regulatory risks 

our businesses are subject to governmental regulations and tax and accounting requirements and may be materially adversely affected by these regulations or requirements or any changes to them 

the electric power and natural gas industries are subject to governmental regulations and our businesses are also subject to complex accounting and tax requirements the regulations and requirements that affect us may from time to time undergo significant changes on the federal state local and foreign levels including in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these regulations and requirements including in the event of changes to these regulations and requirements or how they are implemented or interpreted could materially and adversely affect how we conduct our business and increase our operating costs new tax legislation regulations or interpretations in the us and other countries in which we operate or do business could materially adversely affect our tax expense andor tax balances and changes in tax policies could materially adversely impact our businesses any failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties including criminal penalties in some cases and result in the temporary or permanent shutdown of certain facilities and operations the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the california utilities and other sempra energy businesses these rules are commonly referred to as “affiliate rules” which primarily impact commodity and commodityrelated transactions these businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or to their interpretations or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell natural gas or electricity to or to trade with the california utilities and with each other affiliate rules also restrict these businesses from entering into any such transactions with the california utilities any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the lng facilities natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or other operations of our subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses require numerous permits licenses franchises and other approvals and agreements from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies and the failure to obtain or maintain any of them could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses and operations require numerous permits licenses rightsofway franchise agreements certificates and other approvals and agreements from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies these approvals may not be granted in a timely manner or at all or may be modified rescinded or fail to be extended by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses or as a result of litigation for example socalgas’ franchise agreements with the city of los angeles and los angeles county are due to expire in december 2021 and june 2023 respectively and sdge’s franchise agreement with the city of san diego was scheduled to expire in january 2021 sdge participated in the city’s competitive bid process for the franchises which the city subsequently canceled in december 2020 the city of san diego and sdge agreed to extend the natural gas and electric franchises to june 1 2021 the extension is intended to provide newly elected city officials time to seek public input and additional information the city has announced its plan to start a new competitive bid process in the first quarter of 2021 successfully obtaining maintaining or renewing any or all of these approvals could result in higher costs or the imposition of conditions or restrictions on the manner in which we operate our businesses furthermore our permits require compliance by us and may require compliance by our underlying customers failure by us or our customers to comply with permit license rightofway or franchise requirements could result in these approvals and agreements being modified suspended 

or rescinded and could subject us to significant fines and penalties if one or more of these approvals or agreements were to be suspended rescinded or otherwise terminated including due to expiration or be modified in a manner that makes our continued operation of the applicable business prohibitively expensive or otherwise undesirable or impossible we may be required to temporarily or permanently cease certain of our operations sell the associated assets or remove them from service construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area or any combination of the foregoing in which case we may lose a significant portion of our rate base or other revenue generating assets our prospects may be materially adversely affected and we may incur significant impairment charges or other costs that may not be recoverable the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

we may invest significant amounts of money in major capital projects prior to receiving regulatory approval if there is a delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals if any regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes or other requirements that increase costs or impose restrictions on our existing or planned operations if we fail to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with them or other applicable laws or regulations if we are involved in litigation that adversely impacts any required approvals or rights to the applicable property or if management decides not to proceed with a project we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project any such occurrence could cause our operations and prospects to materially decline and our costs to materially increase result in material impairments and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows andor results of operations 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection including air quality water quality and usage wastewater discharge solid waste management hazardous waste disposal and remediation conservation of natural resources wetlands and wildlife renewable energy resources climate change and ghg emissions among others to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees and these amounts could increase as a result of various factors that we may not control including if these legal requirements change permits are not issued renewed or amended as anticipated energy demands increase or our mix of energy supplies changes our regulated utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates in addition we may be ultimately responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our projects and properties in each case regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown which exposes us to risks arising from contamination at our former or existing facilities or with respect to offsite waste disposal sites that have been used in our operations in the case of our regulated utilities some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates our facilities including those of our jvs are subject to laws and regulations that have been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to power generation facilities failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines including criminal penalties in some cases andor significant curtailments of our operations which could materially adversely affect our cash flows andor results of operations 

increasing international national regional and statelevel environmental concerns as well as related new or proposed legislation and regulation may have material negative effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansions or other capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects in particular existing and potential state national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions may materially limit operations or otherwise materially adversely affect us for example sb 100 requires each california electric utility including sdge to procure 50 of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2026 and 60 by 2030 sb 100 also creates the policy of meeting all of california’s retail electricity supply with a mix of rps programeligible and zerocarbon resources by 2045 the law also includes stipulations that this policy not increase carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid and not allow resource shuffling and requires that the cpuc cec carb and other state agencies incorporate this policy into all relevant planning in addition to signing sb 100 into law the thengovernor of california also signed an executive order establishing a new statewide goal to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible and no later than 2045 and achieve and maintain net negative emissions thereafter the executive order calls on carb to address this goal in future scoping plans which affect several major sectors of california’s economy including transportation agriculture development industrial and others california recently issued new climate initiatives in line with this statewide goal including two executive orders requiring sales of all passenger vehicles to be zeroemission by 2035 our california utilities and any of our other businesses impacted by similar future laws and regulations may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates or with respect to our nonregulated utility businesses if such costs are not able to be passed through to customers even if such costs are recoverable the effects of existing and proposed ghg emission reduction standards may cause rates or other costs to customers to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth which may have a material adverse effect on the cash flows performance businesses andor prospects of the 

california utilities and any of our other affected businesses sdge as well as any of our other businesses affected by similar mandates in the future may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

in addition existing and future laws orders and regulations regarding mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates methane or other emissions or interpretations or revisions to these laws orders and regulations could result in requirements for additional monitoring pollution monitoring and control equipment safety practices other operational changes to satisfy new mandates or emission fees taxes or penalties any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or other proceedings in which we are involved 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits binding arbitrations and regulatory proceedings including in connection with the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility natural gas leak that we discuss in further detail below under “risks related to the california utilities – legal and regulatory risks” we discuss material pending proceedings in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts of money time and employee and management focus defending these lawsuits and proceedings and on related investigations and regulatory proceedings the uncertainties inherent in lawsuits arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the timing costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part by insurance or in rates from our customers any of the foregoing could cause significant reputational damage and materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

risks related to the california utilities 

operational risks 

the california utilities are subject to risks arising from the operation maintenance and upgrade of their natural gas and electricity infrastructure and information technology systems which if they materialize could materially and adversely affect sempra energy’s and the california utilities’ financial results 

the california utilities own and operate electric transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas transmission distribution and storage facilities which are in many cases interconnected andor managed by information technology systems even though the california utilities undertake substantial capital investment projects to construct replace maintain improve and upgrade these facilities and systems there is a risk of among other things potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure and information technology systems human error in operations or maintenance shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment material and labor operational restrictions resulting from environmental requirements and governmental interventions and performance below expected levels and these risks could be amplified while capital investment projects are in process because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by events occurring on the systems of such third parties some of which may be unanticipated or uncontrollable by us 

additional risks associated with the ability of the california utilities to safely and reliably operate maintain improve and upgrade their facilities and systems many of which are beyond the california utilities’ control include among others 

▪ failure to meet customer demand for natural gas andor electricity curtailments controlled or uncontrolled gas outages or gas surges back into homes that could cause serious personal injury or loss of life 

▪ a prolonged widespread electrical blackout that results in damage to the california utilities’ equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties 

▪ the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air water or soil including gas leaks 

▪ severe weather events or natural disasters pandemics or attacks by third parties such as cyberattacks acts of terrorism vandalism or war the effects of which we discuss above under “risks related to all sempra energy businesses – operational risks” 

▪ inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to catastrophic events that could lead to public or employee harm or extended outages 

the occurrence of any of these events could affect demand for natural gas or electricity cause unplanned outages damage the california utilities’ assets andor operations damage the assets andor operations of third parties on which the california utilities rely damage property owned by customers or others and cause personal injury or death any such events could materially adversely affect sempra energy’s and one or both of the california utilities’ financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

wildfires in california pose a significant risk to the california utilities’ particularly sdge’s and sempra energy’s business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

potential for increased and more severe wildfires 

in 2020 california experienced some of the largest wildfires measured by acres burned in its history frequent and more severe drought conditions inconsistent and extreme swings in precipitation changes in vegetation caused by these precipitation swings or other factors unseasonably warm temperatures very low humidity and stronger winds have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the intensity and prevalence of wildfires in california including in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories and have made these wildfires increasingly difficult to predict and contain changing weather patterns including as a result of climate change could cause these conditions to become even more extreme and unpredictable these wildfires could place thirdparty property and the california utilities’ electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy and reduce the availability of hydroelectric generators and these wildfires and the associated weather conditions could result in temporary power shortages in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories in addition certain of california’s local land use policies and forestry management practices have been relaxed to allow for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in highrisk fire areas that may not have the infrastructure or contingency plans necessary to address wildfire risks which could lead to increased thirdparty claims and greater losses for which sdge or socalgas may be liable we discuss the effects wildfires or other natural disasters could have on our businesses including the ways in which they could materially adversely affect the california utilities’ and sempra energy’s business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows in this risk factor below and above under “risks related to all sempra energy businesses – operational risks” 

the wildfire legislation 

in july 2019 the governor of california signed the wildfire legislation into law which addresses certain important issues related to catastrophic wildfires in the state of california and their impact on electric ious investorowned gas distribution utilities such as socalgas are not covered by this legislation the issues addressed include wildfire mitigation cost recovery standards and requirements a wildfire fund a cap on liability safety certifications and the establishment of a wildfire safety board the wildfire legislation did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation which imposes strict liability meaning that liability is imposed regardless of fault on a utility whose equipment such as its electric distribution and transmission lines is determined to be a cause of a fire in such an event the utility would be responsible for the costs of damages including potential business interruption losses as well as interest and attorneys’ fees even if the utility has not been found negligent the doctrine of inverse condemnation also is not exclusive of other theories of liability including if the utility were found negligent in which case additional liabilities such as fire suppression cleanup and evacuation costs medical expenses and personal injury punitive and other damages could be imposed the wildfire legislation established a revised legal standard for the recovery of wildfire costs revised prudent manager standard and established the wildfire fund designed to provide liquidity to participating california electric ious to pay wildfirerelated claims against a participating iou in the event that the governmental agency responsible for determining causation determines such iou’s equipment caused the ignition of a wildfire primary insurance coverage is exceeded and certain other conditions are satisfied however the standards prescribed by the wildfire legislation may not be effectively implemented or applied consistently by the state of california or the wildfire fund could be completely exhausted due to fires in other california ious’ service territories by fires in sdge’s service territory or by a combination thereof which could impact our ability to timely access capital necessary to address in whole or in part inverse condemnation and other liabilities although sdge is not aware of any claims made against the wildfire fund by any participating iou there is no assurance that one or more participating ious will not submit claims against the wildfire fund in connection with any past or future wildfires as a result we are unable to predict whether the wildfire legislation will be effectively implemented or consistently applied or its impact on sdge’s ability to recover certain costs and expenses in the event that sdge’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation if a major fire is determined to be caused by sdge’s equipment or if a major fire is determined to be caused by another california electric iou and the wildfire fund is depleted as a result sempra energy’s and sdge’s business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

cost recovery through insurance or rates 

we have experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could be caused by the california utilities’ operations particularly sdge’s operations and these conditions could continue or worsen as a result of the strict liability standard applied to electric ioucaused wildfires in california substantial recent losses recorded by insurance companies and the risk of an increase in the number and size of wildfires insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be available or may be available only at rates that are prohibitively expensive in addition the insurance that has been obtained for wildfire liabilities and the insurance for these liabilities that may be available in the future if any may not be sufficient to cover all losses that we may incur or it may not be available in sufficient amounts to meet the 1 billion of primary insurance required by the wildfire legislation uninsured losses may not be recoverable in customer rates and increases in the cost of insurance may be challenged when we seek cost recovery through the regulatory process we are unable to predict whether we would be allowed to recover in rates or from the wildfire fund the costs of any uninsured losses a loss which is not fully insured sufficiently covered by the wildfire fund andor cannot be recovered in customer rates such as the cpuc decision denying sdge’s recovery of costs related to wildfires in its service territory in 2007 could materially adversely affect sempra energy’s and one or both of the california utilities’ financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

wildfire mitigation efforts 

although we spend significant resources on measures designed to mitigate wildfire risks there is no assurance that these measures will be successful or effective in reducing our wildfirerelated losses or that their costs will be fully recoverable in rates the california utilities are required by applicable california law to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the wildfire safety division of the cpuc and could be subject to increased risks if these plans are not approved in a timely manner and fines or penalties for any failure to comply with the approved plans one of our wildfire mitigation tools is to deenergize certain of our facilities when weather conditions become extreme and there is elevated wildfire ignition risk in an effort to help mitigate this safety risk to the public such “public safety power shutoffs” have been subject to significant scrutiny by various stakeholders including customers regulators and law makers that could lead to legislation or rulemaking that increases the risk of penalties and liability for damages associated with these events such costs may not be recoverable in rates unrecoverable costs adverse legislation or rulemaking scrutiny by key stakeholders or other negative effects associated with wildfire mitigation efforts could materially adversely affect sempra energy’s and sdge’s financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

the electricity industry is undergoing significant change including increased deployment of distributed energy resources technological advancements and political and regulatory developments 

electric utilities in california are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources such as solar generation energy storage energy efficiency and demand response technologies and california’s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of these industry changes this growth of distributed energy resources will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to among other things accommodate increasing twoway flows of electricity and increase the grid’s capacity to interconnect distributed energy resources moreover enabling california’s clean energy goals will require sustained investments in grid modernization renewable integration projects energy efficiency programs energy storage options and electric vehicle infrastructure the cpuc is conducting proceedings to evaluate various projects and pilots implement changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources determine what if any compensation would be feasible and appropriate and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator these proceedings and the broader changes in california’s electricity industry could result in new regulations policies andor operational changes that could materially adversely affect sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

sdge provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a longterm basis while sdge currently provides such procurement service for most of its customer load customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than sdge through programs such as da and cca da is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours and cca is only available if a customer’s local jurisdiction city offers such a program several local jurisdictions including the city and county of san diego and other municipalities have implemented are implementing or are considering implementing cca which could result in sdge providing procurement service for less than half of its current customer load as early as december 31 2021 when customers are served by another load serving entity sdge no longer procures electricity for this departing load and the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources could then be borne by sdge’s remaining bundled procurement customers existing state law requires that customers opting to have cca procure their electricity must absorb the cost of abovemarket electricity procurement commitments already made by sdge on their behalf which requirements are designed to equitably share costs among customers served by sdge and 

customers served by da and cca if adequate mechanisms are not implemented to help ensure compliance with state law or if state law changes remaining bundled customers of sdge could potentially experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of cca customers prior to their departure or if all such costs are not recoverable in rates sdge could experience material increases in its unrecoverable commodity costs if legislative regulatory or legal action is taken that has the effect of preventing or delaying recovery of these procurement costs or if mechanisms are not in place to help ensure compliance with state law the unrecovered costs could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition andor results of operations 

natural gas and natural gas storage have increasingly been the subject of political and public scrutiny including a desire by some to substantially reduce or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source 

certain california legislators and stakeholder advocacy and activist groups have expressed a desire to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source by advocating increased use of renewable electricity and electrification in lieu of the use of natural gas certain california state agencies have recently proposed public policies that would prohibit or restrict the use and consumption of natural gas for example in new buildings and appliances and certain local city governments have passed ordinances restricting use of natural gas connections in newly constructed buildings these proposals and ordinances and any other similar regulatory action could have the effect of reducing natural gas use over time in addition carb california’s primary regulator for ghg emission reduction programs has published plans for reducing ghg emissions in line with california’s climate goals that include proposals to reduce natural gas demand including more aggressive energy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use increased renewable generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load and replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances carb’s plans also propose that some conventional natural gas be displaced with abovemarket renewable natural gas which could result in increased costs that may not be fully recoverable in rates and carb is currently considering updates to its ghg reduction plans which are due to be finalized in 2022 that could further reduce natural gas demand the cpuc has initiated an oir to update gas reliability standards determine the regulatory changes necessary to improve coordination between natural gas utilities and natural gasfired electric generators and implement a longterm planning strategy to manage the state’s transition away from natural gasfueled technologies to meet california’s decarbonization goals the oir will be conducted in two phases the first of which is addressing reliability standards and coordination between natural gas utilities and natural gasfired electric generators and the second of which will implement a longterm planning strategy a substantial reduction or the elimination of natural gas as an energy source in california could lead to certain of socalgas’ and sdge’s gas assets no longer meeting cpuc standards to recover costs and earn an associated rate of return thus potentially causing our substantial investment in the value of these gas assets to be depreciated on an accelerated basis or become stranded and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ sdge’s and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition andor results of operations 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility that is being decommissioned 

sdge has a 20 ownership interest in songs formerly a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california that is in the process of being decommissioned by edison the majority owner of songs sdge and each of the other owners is responsible for financing its share of expenses and capital expenditures including decommissioning activities although the facility is being decommissioned sdge’s ownership interest in songs continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility which include among other things 

▪ the potential release of a radioactive material including from a natural disaster that could cause catastrophic harm to human health and the environment 

▪ the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the prior operation of nuclear facilities and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials 

▪ limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with operations and the decommissioning of the facility 

▪ uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning the facility 

in addition sdge maintains ndts for providing funds to decommission songs trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities which are subject to significant market fluctuations a decline in the market value of trust assets an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts or changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates technology and the cost of labor materials and equipment could increase the funding requirements for these trusts which costs in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates furthermore cpuc approval is required in order to make withdrawals from these trusts cpuc approval for certain expenditures may be denied altogether if the cpuc determines that the expenditures are unreasonable in addition decommissioning may be materially more expensive than 

we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the trust funds rate recovery for overruns would require cpuc approval which may not occur 

the occurrence of any of these events could result in a substantial reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

we discuss songs further in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

legal and regulatory risks 

the california utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may materially adversely affect us 

rates and other capitalrelated matters 

the cpuc regulates the california utilities’ customer rates except for sdge’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates among other matters the california utilities’ 

▪ conditions of service 

▪ sales of securities 

▪ rates of return 

▪ capital structure 

▪ rates of depreciation 

▪ longterm resource procurement 

the cpuc periodically approves the california utilities’ customer rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs including income taxes and an authorized rate of return on investments as well as settlements with third parties while incorporating a riskbased decisionmaking framework the outcome of ratemaking proceedings can be affected by various factors many of which are not in our control including among others the level of opposition by intervening parties potential rate impacts increasing levels of regulatory review changes in the political regulatory or legislative environments and the opinions of applicable regulators consumer and other stakeholder organizations and customers about the california utilities’ ability to provide safe reliable and affordable electric and gas services these ratemaking proceedings include decisions about major programs in which socalgas and sdge make significant investments under an approved cpuc framework but which investments may remain subject to a cpuc reasonableness review or filing that could result in the disallowance of a portion of the incurred costs the california utilities also may be required to incur costs and make investments to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives such as those relating to the development of a statewide electric vehicle charging infrastructure the deployment of distributed energy resources implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs energy storage and renewable energy targets gas distribution and transmission safety and integrity and underground gas storage among others the california utilities’ ability to recover these costs and investments depends in part on the final form of the legislative or regulatory requirements and the ratemaking mechanisms associated with them and could also be impacted by the timing and process of the ratemaking mechanism in which there is a potentially significant time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers’ rates and there could be potentially material differences between the forecasted or authorized costs embedded in rates which are set on a prospective basis and the amount of actual costs incurred the cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects of sempra energy and each of the california utilities may be materially adversely affected by their rates which can be impacted by among other things 

▪ delays by the cpuc on decisions regarding recovery 

▪ the results of afterthefact reasonableness reviews with unclear standards 

▪ finalization of legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives in an unexpected manner 

▪ rejection of settlements with third parties 

▪ decisions denying recovery or authorizing less than full recovery on the basis that costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons 

▪ actual capital expenditures or operating costs exceeding the amounts approved by the cpuc 

in addition changes in key benchmark interest rates may trigger automatic adjustment mechanisms that determine the california utilities’ authorized rates of return specifically the ccm considers changes in interest rates based on the applicable 12month average moody’s utility bond index if triggered the ccm would automatically update the california utilities’ authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and authorized roe upward or downward by onehalf of the difference between the ccm benchmark 

and the applicable 12month average moody’s utility bond index for the 12months ended september 30 2020 sdge and socalgas were close to their respective benchmark rates but did not trigger the ccm interest rates referenced in the applicable moody’s utility bond indices have been more than 100 bps below the benchmark since the beginning of the current measurement period if these interest rates remain at current levels through the remainder of the current measurement period a triggering event for sdge and socalgas could occur a trigger of the ccm in 2021 that requires a downward adjustment could materially adversely affect the results of operations and cash flows of sempra energy and depending on the ccm that is triggered sdge and socalgas beginning january 1 2022 we discuss the ccm further in “part i – item 1 business – ratemaking mechanisms – california utilities – cost of capital proceedings” and in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets and other similar matters involving sdge these ratemaking mechanisms are subject to many risks similar to those described above regarding the cpuc 

cpuc authority over operational matters 

the cpuc has regulatory authority related to utility operations safety standards and practices competitive conditions  reliability and planning affiliate relationships and a wide range of other matters including citation programs concerning matters such as safety activity disconnection and billing practices resource adequacy and environmental compliance many of these standards and programs are becoming more stringent and could impose severe penalties for example sdge and socalgas are subject to a safety enforcement program developed by the cpuc pursuant to sb 291 that includes procedures for monitoring data tracking and analysis and investigations and delegates citation authority to cpuc staff under the direction of the cpuc executive director the cpuc staff has authority to issue citations up to an administrative limit of 8 million per citation under this program and penalties issued by the cpuc under the program can exceed this administrative limit having exceeded 15 billion in one instance for an unrelated third party the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of the matters under its authority including compliance with cpuc regulations and could launch investigations or open proceedings at any time on any issue it deems appropriate the results of which could lead to citations disallowances fines and penalties any such citations disallowances fines or penalties for noncompliance with any cpuc regulations programs or standards as well as any corrective or mitigation actions required to become in compliance if not sufficiently funded in customer rates could have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s and the california utilities’ results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the california utilities’ rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in notes 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

influence of other organizations and potential regulatory changes 

the california utilities and sempra energy may be materially adversely affected by revisions or reinterpretations of existing or new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies any of which could change how the california utilities operate affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or require them to incur substantial additional expenses 

the california utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as cal pa turn utility consumers’ action network sierra club and other stakeholder advocacy and activist groups to the extent that any of these groups are successful in directly or indirectly influencing the california utilities’ operations this could have a material adverse effect on the california utilities’ and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects 

socalgas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs expenses and other liabilities related to the leak a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance 

from october 23 2015 through february 11 2016 socalgas experienced a natural gas leak from one of the injectionandwithdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in los angeles county as described in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements numerous lawsuits investigations and regulatory proceedings have been initiated in response to the leak resulting in significant costs 

civil and criminal litigation 

as of february 22 2021 395 lawsuits including approximately 36000 plaintiffs are pending against socalgas related to the leak some of which have also named sempra energy all these cases other than a matter brought by the los angeles county district attorney and the federal securities class action discussed below are coordinated before a single court in the la superior court for pretrial management the initial trial previously scheduled for june 2020 for a small number of randomly selected individual plaintiffs was postponed with a new trial date yet to be determined by the court 

four shareholder derivative actions were filed alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain officers and certain directors of sempra energy andor socalgas three of the actions were joined in an amended consolidated shareholder derivative complaint which was dismissed with prejudice in january 2021 the remaining action was also dismissed but plaintiffs were given leave to amend their complaint 

a misdemeanor criminal complaint was filed by the los angeles county district attorney’s office as to which socalgas entered a settlement that was approved by the la superior court challenges by certain residents have been rejected by the california supreme court 

additional litigation including by public entities and criminal complaints may be filed against us related to the leak or our responses thereto 

the costs of defending against or settling or otherwise resolving the civil and criminal lawsuits and any compensatory statutory or punitive damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs if awarded or imposed as well as the costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released could be significant we discuss these risks further above under “risks related to all sempra energy businesses – legal and regulatory risks” and in this risk factor below under “insurance and estimated costs” 

governmental investigations orders and additional regulation 

in january 2016 calgem and the cpuc selected blade to conduct under their supervision an independent analysis of the technical root cause of the leak to be funded by socalgas the root cause analysis was released in may 2019 and did not identify any instances of noncompliance by socalgas and concluded that socalgas’ compliance activities conducted prior to the leak did not find indications of a casing integrity issue but also opined that there were measures though not required by gas storage regulations at the time that could have been taken to aid in the early identification of corrosion and that in blade’s opinion would have prevented or mitigated the leak 

in june 2019 the cpuc opened an oii to consider penalties against socalgas for the leak the first phase will consider whether socalgas violated applicable laws cpuc orders or decisions rules or requirements whether socalgas engaged in unreasonable andor imprudent practices with respect to its operation and maintenance of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility or its related recordkeeping practices whether socalgas cooperated sufficiently with the sed and blade during the preformal investigation and whether any of the mitigation proposed by blade should be implemented to the extent not already done in november 2019 the sed based largely on the blade report alleged a total of 330 violations asserting that socalgas violated california public utilities code section 451 and failed to cooperate in the investigation and to keep proper records hearings on a subset of issues are scheduled to begin in march 2021 the second phase will consider whether socalgas should be sanctioned for the leak and what damages fines or other penalties or sanctions if any should be imposed for any violations unreasonable or imprudent practices or failure to sufficiently cooperate with the sed as determined by the cpuc in the first phase in addition the second phase will determine the amounts of various costs incurred by socalgas and other parties in connection with the leak and the ratemaking treatment or other disposition of such costs which could result in little or no recovery of such costs by socalgas socalgas has engaged in settlement discussions with the sed in connection with this proceeding 

higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas as a result of these investigations or new laws orders rules and regulations arising out of this incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates in addition any of these investigations could result in findings of violations of laws orders rules or regulations as well as fines and penalties any of which could cause significant reputational damage the occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition andor results of operations 

natural gas storage operations and reliability 

natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods including peak electric generation needs in the summer and consumer heating needs in the winter the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility is the largest socalgas storage facility and an important element of socalgas’ delivery system as a result of the leak socalgas suspended injection of natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility beginning in october 2015 and following a comprehensive safety review and authorization by calgem and the cpuc’s executive director resumed injection operations in july 2017 based on limited operating ranges for the field in february 2017 the cpuc opened a proceeding pursuant to sb 380 oii to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region including considering alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility’s services if it were eliminated 

if the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value it could result in an impairment of the facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs andor additional capital expenditures and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized at december 31 2020 the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of 821 million any significant impairment of this asset or higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas that may not be recoverable in customer rates could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

insurance and estimated costs 

at december 31 2020 socalgas estimates certain costs related to the leak are 1627 million the cost estimate which includes the 1279 million of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance this cost estimate may increase significantly as more information becomes available a substantial portion of the cost estimate has been paid and 451 million is accrued as reserve for aliso canyon costs as of december 31 2020 on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s consolidated balance sheets 

the actions against us related to the leak as described in this risk factor above under “civil and criminal litigation” seek compensatory statutory and punitive damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs in addition we could be subject to damages fines or other penalties or sanctions as a result of the investigations and other matters described in this risk factor above under “governmental investigations orders and additional regulation” except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions as described in this risk factor above under “civil and criminal litigation” the cost estimate does not include litigation regulatory proceedings or regulatory costs to the extent it is not possible to predict at this time the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the costs to defend or resolve the actions or the amount of damages restitution or civil administrative or criminal fines sanctions penalties or other costs or remedies that may be imposed or incurred the cost estimate also does not include certain other costs incurred by sempra energy associated with defending against shareholder derivative lawsuits and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate these costs not included in the cost estimate could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

we have received insurance payments for many of the costs included in the cost estimate and we intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for all other costs we have incurred other than insurance for certain future defense costs we may incur as well as directors’ and officers’ liability we have exhausted all of our insurance in this matter we continue to pursue other sources of insurance coverage for costs related to this matter but we may not be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for any of these costs if we are not able to secure additional insurance recovery if any costs we have recorded as an insurance receivable are not collected if there are delays in receiving insurance recoveries or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible such amounts which could be significant could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

additional information 

we discuss aliso canyon natural gas storage facility matters further in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the failure by the cpuc to adequately reform sdge’s rate structure including the implementation of charges independent of consumption volume and measures to reduce nem rate subsidies could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

the nem program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of onsite renewable generation primarily solar installations for residential and business customers under nem qualifying customergenerators receive a full retail rate for the energy they generate that is fed to the utility’s power grid this occurs during times when the customer’s generation exceeds their own energy usage under this structure nem customers do not pay their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system subject to certain exceptions while they still receive electricity from the system when their selfgeneration is inadequate to meet their electricity needs the unpaid nem costs are subsidized by customers not participating in nem accordingly as more electricuse customers and higher electricuse residential customers switch to nem and selfgenerate energy the burden on the remaining customers increases which in turn encourages more selfgeneration further increasing rate pressure on existing nonnem customers 

the current electric residential rate structure in california is primarily based on consumption volume which places a higher rate burden on customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers in july 2015 the cpuc adopted a decision that provided a framework for rates that could be more transparent fair and sustainable the framework provides for a minimum 

monthly bill fewer rate tiers and a gradual reduction in the differences between the tiered rates and directs the utilities to pursue expanded timeofuse rates most elements of the framework were implemented in 2020 and should result in some relief for higheruse customers and a rate structure that better aligns rates with actual costs to serve customers the decision also established a process for electric utilities to seek implementation of a fixed charge for residential customers subject to certain conditions however in march 2020 the cpuc adopted a decision rejecting electric utilities’ requests to establish a fixed residential charge the decision allows the utilities to renew their requests for a fixed charge at a later date if such proposals include an adequate customer outreach and communications plan in august 2020 the cpuc initiated a rulemaking to further develop a successor to the existing nem tariff we expect a decision establishing a successor tariff to be issued in the fourth quarter of 2021 with implementation of the successor tariff by january 2022 depending on the structure and functionality of such a successor tariff which is uncertain the current risks associated with the existing nem tariff could continue or increase 

sdge believes the establishment of a charge independent of consumption volume for residential customers is critical to help ensure rates are distributed among all customers that rely on the electric transmission and distribution system including those participating in the nem program in addition distributed energy resources and energy efficiency initiatives could generally reduce delivered volumes increasing the importance of a fixed charge the absence of a charge independent of consumption volume coupled with the continuing increase of solar installation and other forms of selfgeneration could adversely impact electricity rates and the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system which could subject sdge to higher levels of customer dissatisfaction increased likelihood of noncompliance with cpuc or other safety or operational standards and increased risks attendant to any such noncompliance as we discuss above under “risks related to the california utilities – legal and regulatory risks” and also could increase sdge’s costs including power procurement operating or capital costs and increase the likelihood of disallowance of recovery for these costs 

if the cpuc fails to adequately reform sdge’s rate structure to better achieve reasonable costbased electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system such failure could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

risks related to our interest in oncor 

certain ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management and policies of oncor 

various “ringfencing” measures are in place to enhance oncor’s separateness from its owners and to mitigate the risk that oncor would be negatively impacted in the event of a bankruptcy or other adverse financial developments affecting its owners this ringfence creates both legal and financial separation between oncor holdings oncor and their subsidiaries on the one hand and sempra energy and its affiliates and subsidiaries on the other hand 

in accordance with the ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments we established in connection with our acquisition of an 8025 indirect interest in oncor in march 2018 we and oncor are subject to various restrictions including among others 

▪ seven members of oncor’s 13person board of directors will be independent directors in all material respects under the rules of the nyse in relation to sempra energy and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities and any other direct or indirect owners of oncor and also will have no material relationship with sempra energy and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities or any other direct or indirect owners of oncor currently or within the previous 10 years with respect to the six remaining directors two will be designated by sempra energy two will be designated by oncor’s minority owner tti and two will be current or former oncor officers 

▪ oncor will not pay any dividends or other distributions except for contractual tax payments if a majority of its independent directors or any of the directors appointed by tti determines that it is in the best interests of oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements 

▪ oncor will not pay dividends or other distributions except for contractual tax payments if that payment would cause its debttoequity ratio to exceed the debttoequity ratio approved by the puct 

▪ if oncor’s senior secured debt credit rating by any of the three major rating agencies falls below bbb or baa2 for moody’s oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions except for contractual tax payments unless otherwise allowed by the puct 

▪ there must be maintained certain “separateness measures” that reinforce the legal and financial separation of oncor from sempra energy including a requirement that dealings between oncor and sempra energy or sempra energy’s affiliates other than oncor holdings and its subsidiaries must be on an arm’slength basis limitations on affiliate transactions and a prohibition on pledging oncor assets or stock for any entity other than oncor 

▪ a majority of oncor’s independent directors and the directors designated by tti that are present and voting of which at least one must be present and voting must approve any annual or multiyear budget if the aggregate amount of capital expenditures or om in such budget is more than a 10 increase or decrease from the corresponding amounts of such expenditures in the budget for the preceding fiscal year or multiyear period as applicable 

▪ sempra energy will continue to hold indirectly at least 51 of the ownership interests in oncor holdings and oncor until at least march 9 2023 unless otherwise specifically authorized by the puct 

as a result we do not control oncor holdings or oncor and we have limited ability to direct the management policies and operations of oncor holdings and oncor including the deployment or disposition of their assets declarations of dividends strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions we have limited representation on the oncor holdings and oncor boards of directors which are each controlled by independent directors moreover all directors of oncor including those directors we have appointed have considerable autonomy and as described in our commitments have a duty to act in the best interest of oncor consistent with the approved ringfence and delaware law which may in certain cases be contrary to our best interests or be in opposition to our preferred strategic direction for oncor to the extent that the directors approve or oncor otherwise pursues actions that are not in our interests the financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects of sempra energy may be materially adversely affected 

changes in the electric utility industry including changes in regulation of ercot could materially adversely affect oncor’s results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects which could materially adversely affect us 

oncor operates in the electric utility sector and is subject to various legislative requirements and regulations by us texas and regional and local authorities as a result it is subject to many of the same or similar risks as our california utilities as we describe above under “risks related to the california utilities” the costs and burdens associated with complying with these requirements and adjusting oncor’s business and operations in response to legislative and regulatory developments including changes in ercot and any fines or penalties that could result from any noncompliance may have a material adverse effect on oncor moreover potential legislative regulatory or market or industry changes may jeopardize the predictability of utility earnings generally in february 2021 following extreme winter weather the puct issued a moratorium on customer disconnections due to nonpayment and could take other similar measures to address financial challenges experienced by other ercot market participants which could adversely impact oncor’s collections and cash flows and in turn could adversely impact us also in february 2021 ercot required transmission companies including oncor to significantly reduce demand on the grid due to insufficient electricity generation caused by extreme winter weather resulting in power outages throughout ercot the governor of texas has declared reform of ercot as an emergency item for the current texas legislative session various regulatory and governmental entities have indicated an intent to investigate the operation of the ercot grid during this extreme winter weather event and additional inquiries could also arise any significant changes relating to the ercot market that impact transmission and distribution utilities as a result of such proceedings or otherwise could materially adversely impact oncor if oncor does not successfully respond to these changes and any other legislative regulatory or market or industry changes applicable to it oncor could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

oncor’s operations are capital intensive and it could have liquidity needs that necessitate additional investments in oncor 

oncor’s business is capital intensive and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements in the past oncor has financed a substantial portion of its cash needs from operations and with proceeds from indebtedness but these sources of capital may not be adequate in the future our commitments to the puct prohibit us from making loans to oncor as a result if oncor fails to meet its capital requirements or if oncor is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs we may elect to make additional capital contributions to oncor any such investments could be substantial and would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

sempra energy could incur substantial tax liabilities if efh’s 2016 spinoff of vistra from efh is deemed to be taxable 

as part of its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings in 2016 efh distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary vistra energy corp formerly tceh corp and referred to herein as vistra to certain creditors of tceh llc the spinoff and vistra became an independent publicly traded company vistra’s spinoff from efh was intended to qualify for partially taxfree treatment to efh and its shareholders under sections 368a1g 355 and 356 of the irc collectively referred to as the intended tax treatment in connection with and as a condition to the spinoff efh received a private letter ruling from 

the irs regarding certain issues relating to the intended tax treatment of the spinoff as well as tax opinions from counsel to efh and vistra regarding certain aspects of the spinoff not covered by the private letter ruling 

in connection with the signing and closing of the merger of efh with an indirect subsidiary of sempra energy with efh continuing as the surviving company and as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of sempra energy the merger efh sought and received a supplemental private letter ruling from the irs and sempra energy and efh received tax opinions from their respective counsels that generally provide that the merger will not affect the conclusions reached in respectively the irs private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spinoff described above similar to the irs private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spinoff the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs and any opinions issued with respect to the merger are based on factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by sempra energy and efh now sempra texas holdings corp and a subsidiary of sempra energy if such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete any such undertakings are not complied with or the facts upon which the irs supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions which will not impact the irs position on the transactions are based are different from the actual facts relating to the merger the tax opinions andor supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and as a result could be challenged by the irs even though sempra texas holdings corp would have administrative appeal rights if the irs were to invalidate its private letter ruling andor supplemental private letter ruling including the right to challenge any adverse irs position in court any such appeal would be subject to significant uncertainties and could fail if it is ultimately determined that the merger caused the spinoff not to qualify for the intended tax treatment sempra energy through its ownership of sempra texas holdings corp could incur substantial tax liabilities which would materially reduce and potentially eliminate the value associated with our indirect investment in oncor and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition andor prospects of sempra energy and on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

risks related to our businesses other than the california utilities and our interest in oncor 

operational risks 

project development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled be completed within budget or operate at expected levels which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects  

all energy infrastructure projects 

we are involved in a number of energy infrastructure projects including natural gas liquefaction facilities marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels and lpg terminals and storage natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution infrastructure and other projects the acquisition development construction and expansion of these projects involve numerous risks 

we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply infrastructure development legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if the project is not completed we may have to impair or write off amounts that we have invested in project development and never receive any return on these preliminary investments 

success in developing a project is contingent upon among other things 

▪ our ability to reach a final investment decision or otherwise make progress with respect to any project which may be dependent on our financial condition and cash flows and may be influenced by a number of external factors outside our control including the global economy and global energy and financial markets 

▪ negotiation of satisfactory epc agreements including any renegotiation of total contract price and other terms that may be required in the event of delays in final investment decisions or other failures to meet specified deadlines with respect to a project 

▪ if we intend to have equity partners in the project identification of suitable partners and negotiation of satisfactory equity agreements 

▪ identification of suitable customers and negotiation of satisfactory lng offtake or other customer agreements 

▪ negotiation of satisfactory supply natural gas and lng sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements and ppas 

▪ timely receipt of required governmental permits licenses and other authorizations that do not impose material conditions and are otherwise granted under terms we find reasonable as well as maintenance of these authorizations 

▪ our project partners’ willingness and financial or other ability to make their required investments on a timely basis 

▪ our contractors and other counterparties’ willingness and financial or other ability to fulfill their contractual commitments 

▪ timely satisfactory and onbudget completion of construction which could be negatively affected by engineering problems adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters pandemics cyber or other attacks by third parties work stoppages equipment unavailability contractor performance shortfalls and a variety of other factors many of which we discuss above under “risks related to all sempra energy businesses – operational risks” and in this risk factor below 

▪ obtaining adequate and reasonably priced financing for the project 

▪ the absence of hidden defects or inherited environmental liabilities for any brownfield project construction 

▪ fast and costeffective resolution of any litigation or unsettled property rights affecting a project 

any failures with respect to the above factors or other factors material to any particular project could involve significant additional costs to us and otherwise materially adversely affect the successful completion of a project if we are unable to complete a development project if we experience substantial delays or if construction financing or other project costs exceed our estimated budgets and we are required to make additional capital contributions our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects could be materially adversely affected 

the operation of existing facilities such as cameron lng jv’s phase 1 facility and any future projects we are able to complete involves many risks including among others the potential for unforeseen design flaws engineering challenges equipment failures or the breakdown for other reasons of liquefaction regasification and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution infrastructure or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters pandemics cyber or other attacks by third parties and other similar events can disrupt liquefaction generation regasification storage transmission and distribution systems and have other impacts that we discuss above under “risks related to all sempra energy businesses – operational risks” the occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idle for an extended period of time or our facilities operating below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

lng export projects 

in addition to the risks described above that are applicable to all our energy infrastructure projects we are exposed to additional risks in connection with our lng export projects including cameron lng jv’s phase 1 project and our potential development of additional lng export facilities sempra lng is in discussions with the coowners of cameron lng jv regarding the potential expansion of the facility in phase 2 to include up to two additional liquefaction trains is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction export project near port arthur texas and through a jv agreement with ienova is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction export project at ienova’s existing eca regas facility in baja california mexico to be developed in two phases a midscale project referred to as eca lng phase 1 and a largescale project referred to as eca lng phase 2 these projects are at various stages of development and we have only reached a final investment decision with respect to eca lng phase 1 which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 we discuss each of our lng export projects further in “part ii – item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – sempra lng” 

each of these projects faces numerous risks and must overcome significant hurdles our ability to reach a final investment decision for each project and if such a decision is reached and a project is completed the overall success of such project are dependent on global energy markets including natural gas and oil supply demand and pricing in general a shift in the supply of natural gas could depress lng prices and the cost advantages of exporting lng from the us in addition global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections could reduce the demand for natural gas in some sectors and cause a corresponding reduction in projected global demand for lng such a reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation or as a result of calls by some to limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source globally any of these developments could result in increased or decreased competition and impact prospects for developing projects in an environment of declining lng demand and could negatively affect the performance and prospects of any of our projects that are or become operational moreover if and as our development projects become operational such projects could become competitive against each other which would harm the overall success of our lng export strategy at certain moderate levels oil prices could also make lng projects in other parts of the world more feasible and competitive with lng projects in north america thus increasing supply and competition for the available lng demand a decline in natural gas prices outside the us which in many foreign countries are based on the price of crude oil may also materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas based on henry hub pricing which could further decrease demand for domestic lng and increase competition among lng project developers 

there are a number of potential new lng projects in addition to ours that are under construction or in the process of development by various project developers in north america and given the projected global demand for lng and the inherent risks of these projects the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed our proposed projects may face distinct disadvantages relative to some of the other projects under construction or in development for example 

▪ our port arthur texas project is a greenfield site and therefore it does not have some of the advantages often associated with brownfield sites some of these disadvantages include increased costs and time to construct which could materially adversely affect the development of this project 

▪ the proposed expansion of the cameron lng jv facility phase 2 is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the project financing agreements for phase 1 of the project including among others timing restrictions unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the project lenders and requires unanimous consent of all jv partners including with respect to the equity investment obligations of each partner there is no assurance that these conditions and requirements can be satisfied in which case our ability to develop the phase 2 project would be jeopardized 

▪ the eca regas facility the eca lng phase 1 liquefaction export project under construction and the potential eca lng phase 2 liquefaction export project in mexico are subject to ongoing land and permit disputes that could make finding or maintaining suitable partners and customers difficult and could also hinder or halt construction and if the project is completed operations we discuss these risks further below under “risks related to our businesses other than the california utilities and our interest in oncor – legal and regulatory risks” in addition while we have completed the regulatory process for this lng export facility in the us the regulatory process in mexico and the overlay of us regulations for natural gas exports to an lng export facility in mexico are not well developed we experienced significant delays obtaining a necessary export permit from the mexican government for the eca lng phase 1 liquefaction export project due in part to government closures as a result of the covid19 pandemic which resulted in material delays in our ability to reach a final investment decision for this project and we could experience similar delays or face other hurdles in obtaining renewing or maintaining all necessary permits and other approvals from the mexican government for projects in the future as a result there is no assurance that the proposed eca lng phase 2 project will be constructed and operated without facing significant regulatory challenges and uncertainties or at all which in turn could make project financing as well as finding or maintaining suitable partners and customers for the eca lng phase 2 project difficult finally we have planned measures to not disrupt operations at the eca regas facility with the construction of the eca lng phase 1 project however this is not the case with respect to the construction of the eca lng phase 2 project which we expect may conflict with the current operations at the eca regas facility the eca regas facility currently has longterm regasification contracts for 100 of the regasification facility’s capacity through 2028 making the decision on whether and how to pursue the eca lng phase 2 project dependent in part on whether the investment in a largescale liquefaction export facility would over the long term be more beneficial than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts 

in connection with certain of these lng export development opportunities we have entered into or may enter into heads of agreements interim project participation agreements mous andor similar arrangements all of which are or will be nonbinding and do not or will not obligate any of the parties to execute any definitive agreements or participate in any such opportunities any decisions by sempra energy or our potential counterparties to proceed with a final investment decision except with respect to the eca lng phase 1 project for which a final investment decision has been reached or binding agreements with respect to our proposed liquefaction export projects will require among other things obtaining or maintaining binding customer commitments to purchase lng completion of project assessments and achieving other necessary internal and external approvals of each party in addition all our proposed lng export projects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including among others the receipt and maintenance of a number of permits and approvals finding or maintaining suitable partners and customers obtaining or maintaining financing and incentives negotiating and completing or maintaining suitable commercial agreements including equity acquisition and governance agreements natural gas supply and transportation agreements lng sale and purchase agreements and construction contracts including new epc contracts for certain projects and except for eca lng phase 1 reaching a final investment decision 

there is no assurance that our proposed lng export facilities will be completed in accordance with estimated timelines and budgets or at all and our inability to complete one or more of these facilities or significant delays or cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects including the recoverability of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in these projects to date 

financing arrangements 

we may become involved in various financing arrangements with respect to any of our energy infrastructure projects some of which could expose us to additional risks for example sempra energy has provided guarantees for its share of cameron lng jv’s financing obligations related to its phase 1 facility for a maximum amount of up to 40 billion which terminate upon cameron lng jv achieving “financial completion” of the initial threetrain liquefaction project including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests although these performance tests are 

currently underway and we anticipate financial completion will be achieved and the guarantees will be terminated in the first half of 2021 this timing could be delayed perhaps substantially if these operational performance tests are not completed due to weatherrelated events or other events or factors beyond our control any failure to achieve financial completion by september 30 2021 unless such date is extended in the event of force majeure would result in an event of default under cameron lng jv’s financing agreements and a potential demand on sempra energy’s guarantees further pursuant to the financing agreements cameron lng jv is restricted from making distributions to its project owners including sempra lng from january 1 2021 until the earlier of september 30 2021 and the achievement of financial completion a delay could materially adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows until financial completion is achieved 

sempra energy also has provided a separate guarantee with a maximum exposure to loss of 979 million under the support agreement for the benefit of cfin in connection with a separate financing arrangement intended to return equity to the cameron lng jv project owners this guarantee terminates upon full repayment of the guaranteed debt by 2039 and the holders of the guarantee are permitted to put the 753 million of guaranteed debt to sempra energy on an annual basis and upon the occurrence of certain specified events including if the guaranteed debt is not paid in accordance with its terms and may determine to transfer some or all of the guaranteed debt to sempra energy at certain specified times 

the loan and other financing agreements related to all of these guarantees contain events of default customary for such financings and the occurrence of any such default could result in a demand on these guarantees if we are required to pay some or all of the amounts under these guarantees or with respect to the guarantee under the support agreement the guaranteed debt becomes a direct financial obligation as a result of any put or call any such payments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

domestic and international hydraulic fracturing operations are subject to political economic and other uncertainties that could increase the costs of doing business impose additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect production of lng and reduce or eliminate lng export opportunities and demand 

domestic and international hydraulic fracturing operations face political and economic risks and other uncertainties several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations to impose more stringent permitting public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations in addition to state laws some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions such as city ordinances that may restrict the performance of or prohibit well drilling in general andor hydraulic fracturing in particular we cannot predict whether additional federal state local or international laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit the current us administration may have a negative view of hydraulic fracturing practices which could increase the risk of regulation negatively affecting these operations if additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations natural gas prices in north america could rise which in turn could materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas based on henry hub pricing and impact the supply of natural gas to cameron lng jv’s phase 1 project and our other lng export projects currently in development increased regulation or difficulty in permitting of hydraulic fracturing and any corresponding increase in domestic natural gas prices could materially adversely affect demand for lng exports and our ability to develop commercially viable lng export facilities beyond cameron lng jv’s phase 1 facility currently in operation and eca lng phase 1 currently in construction 

when our businesses enter into fixedprice longterm contracts to provide services or commodities they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks 

sempra mexico and sempra lng generally endeavor to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities in an effort to optimize the use of their facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure however if these contracts are at fixed prices the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures including rising operational costs costs of labor materials equipment and commodities rising interest rates that affect financing costs and changes in applicable exchange rates we may try to mitigate these risks by among other things using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects providing for cost escalation providing for direct passthrough of operating costs or entering into hedges however these measures if implemented may not fully offset any increases in operating expenses andor financing costs caused by inflationary pressures and using these measures could introduce additional risks the failure to fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

increased competition could materially adversely affect us 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors many of whom have extensive and diversified development andor operating experience including both domestically and internationally and financial resources 

similar to or greater than ours further in recent years the natural gas pipeline storage and lng market segments have been characterized by strong and increasing competition both with respect to winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets in mexico despite the commissioning of many new energy infrastructure projects by the cfe and other governmental agencies competition for recent pipeline projects has been intense with numerous bidders competing aggressively for these projects in addition sempra mexico’s natural gas distribution business faces increased competition now that its former exclusivity period with respect to its distribution zones has expired and other distributors are legally permitted to build and operate natural gas distribution systems and compete to attract customers in the locations where it operates there is no assurance that we will be successful in bidding for new development opportunities in the us or mexico these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

we may not be able to enter into maintain extend or replace expiring longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects 

the eca regas facility has longterm capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties under these agreements customers pay capacity reservation and usage fees to receive store and regasify the customers’ lng we also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreements are intended to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices however the longterm nature of these agreements also exposes us to risks including increased credit risks that we discuss below under “risks related to our businesses other than the california utilities and our interest in oncor – operational risks” in addition in 2020 the two thirdparty capacity customers at the eca regas facility shell mexico and gazprom asserted a breach of contract by ienova and a force majeure event seeking to terminate these capacity agreements and recover damages one of these two customers has stopped making payments under its longterm capacity agreement and ienova has drawn on the customer’s letter of credit provided as payment security has submitted a request for arbitration of the dispute and has filed a constitutional challenge related to the dispute and although the other customer is presently making regular payments under its agreement it has joined the arbitration proceedings related to the dispute in addition one of these customers has commenced legal proceedings in mexican court seeking modification or rescission of certain material permits for the eca regas facility and eca lng an unfavorable decision with respect to all or any part of these challenges and proceedings or the potential for an extended dispute could lead to significant legal and other costs and could materially adversely affect our relationships with these longterm customers and the reliability of revenues from the eca regas facility any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

for certain of our potential liquefaction export projects definitive sale and purchase agreements have been secured for some of the anticipated nameplate capacity of the applicable facility these agreements contain conditions of effectiveness including for example our final investment decision for the applicable project within agreed timelines if these conditions are not satisfied or if these agreements cease to be effective for other reasons we could be subject to significant competition in securing replacement customers for these projects and we may not be able to do so under favorable terms in a timely manner or at all moreover some of the anticipated capacity for these potential projects is not currently subject to definitive customer agreements and we may not be able to identify suitable customers or negotiate satisfactory sale and purchase agreements for all or a portion of this anticipated capacity in a timely manner or at all any such outcome could jeopardize our ability to develop these potential projects and receive an acceptable return on our investments in the projects which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

sempra mexico’s and sempra lng’s ability to enter into or replace existing longterm firm capacity agreements for their natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include our lng export facilities a significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive as more plants are built supplies of energy and related products exceed demand and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may decline or become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility and we may be unable to sell the power that sempra mexico’s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

our businesses depend on the performance of counterparties including with respect to longterm supply sales and capacity agreements and any failure by these parties to perform could result in substantial expenses and business 

disruptions and exposure to commodity price risk and volatility any of which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses and the businesses we invest in depend on business partners customers suppliers and other counterparties who owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements or arrangements to perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements or arrangements should they fail to perform we may be required to enter into alternative arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such an event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties any efforts to enforce the terms of these agreements or arrangements through legal or other available means could involve significant time and costs and would be unpredictable and susceptible to failure in addition many such agreements and arrangements including the relationships with the applicable counterparties are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses further we often extend credit to counterparties and customers and although we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us the failure of any of our counterparties to perform in accordance with their agreements or arrangements with us could materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

our longterm supply sales and firm capacity contracts increase our credit risk if our counterparties fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations for example if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the eca regas facility or sempra mexico’s other longterm capacity agreements for the transportation of natural gas and lpg were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects in addition for cameron lng jv’s phase 1 project cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of total se mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd that collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the facility if the counterparties to these tolling agreements were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations to cameron lng jv on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

certain past assertions made by the cfe and mexican government coupled with past arbitration requests and other statements and actions by the cfe raise serious concerns over whether the terms of sempra mexico’s gas pipeline contracts will be honored or disputed in arbitration the failure by the cfe or other customers to honor the terms of sempra mexico’s gas pipeline contracts and the inability to enter into gas pipeline contracts in the future could have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

sempra mexico’s and sempra lng’s obligations and those of their suppliers for lng are contractually subject to suspension or termination for “force majeure” events which generally are beyond the control of the parties and substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for any breach of the agreements which in each case could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

sempra mexico and sempra lng engage in jvs or invest in companies in which other equity partners may have or share with us control over the applicable project or investment we discuss the risks related to these arrangements above under “risks related to our businesses other than the california utilities and our interest in oncor – operational risks” 

we rely on transportation assets and services much of which we do not own or control to deliver natural gas and electricity 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and services owned and operated by third parties to among other things 

▪ deliver the natural gas and electricity and lpg we sell to wholesale markets or that we use for our natural gas liquefaction export facilities 

▪ supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities 

▪ provide retail energy services to customers 

sempra mexico and sempra lng also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with the ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting and also on specialized ships to transport lng sempra mexico’s subsidiaries also rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities electricity and other services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity natural gas lng or lpg supplies at thencurrent spot market rates or we could lose customers that may be difficult to replace in competitive market conditions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

foreign operations risks 

our international businesses and operations expose us to legal tax economic geopolitical management oversight foreign currency and inflation risks and challenges 

overview 

in mexico we own or have interests in natural gas distribution and transportation assets lpg storage and transportation facilities ethane transportation assets electricity generation facilities lng facilities and ethane and liquid fuels marine and inland terminals we also do business with companies based in foreign markets including particularly our lng export operations developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets operating businesses and contracting with companies in foreign jurisdictions subjects us to significant and complex management security political legal economic and financial risks that vary by country many of which may differ from and potentially be greater than those associated with our wholly domestic businesses including among others 

▪ changes in foreign laws and regulations including tax trade and environmental laws and regulations and us laws and regulations that are related to foreign operations or doing business internationally including us trade and related policies as we discuss below 

▪ actions by local regulatory bodies including setting of rates and tariffs that may be earned by our businesses 

▪ adverse changes in economic or market conditions limitations on ownership in foreign countries and inadequate enforcement of regulations 

▪ risks related to currency exchange and convertibility including vulnerability to appreciation and depreciation of foreign currencies against the us dollar as we discuss below 

▪ permitting and regulatory compliance 

▪ adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals challenges to or difficulty obtaining permits or approvals difficulty enforcing contractual and property rights differing legal standards for lawsuits or other proceedings and unsettled property rights and titles in mexico 

▪ energy policy reform including that which may result in adverse changes to andor difficulty enforcing existing contracts or challenges completing and operating our renewable energy facilities in mexico as we discuss below

▪ violence criminality or social or political instability 

▪ compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws 

▪ with respect to our nonutility international business activities changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers which may be driven by many of the factors listed above among others 

mexican government influence on economic and energy matters 

the mexican government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over the mexican economy and energy landscape mexican governmental actions concerning the economy energy laws and policies and certain governmental agencies including the cfe could have a significant impact on mexican private sector entities in general and on ienova’s operations in particular for example the cfe and the mexican government took certain actions in 2019 that raised serious concerns over whether the terms of sempra mexico’s gas pipeline contracts would be honored or disputed in arbitration ienova and other affected natural gas pipeline developers joined the cfe and the president of mexico’s representatives in negotiations and were able to resolve the dispute but we cannot predict whether similar disputes may arise andor whether such disputes will be resolved on favorable terms to us if at all in addition in 2020 certain mexican governmental agencies issued orders and regulations that would reduce or limit the renewable energy sector’s participation in the country’s energy market although many of these measures have been stayed temporarily as a result of legal complaints filed with applicable mexican courts an unfavorable final decision on these complaints or the potential for an extended dispute could impact our ability to successfully complete construction of our facilities in mexico or to complete them in a timely manner and within expected budgets may impact our ability to operate our facilities already in service in mexico and may adversely affect our ability to develop new renewable energy projects in mexico moreover electricity prices in mexico are currently subsidized by the mexican federal government which could place certain of ienova’s renewable energy projects at a competitive disadvantage additionally the president of mexico presented on february 1 2021 an initiative of amendment of the electrical industry law to include some public policies that are being challenged in court such as establishing priority of dispatch for cfe plants over privately owned plants and other threats to renewable energy on february 3 2021 mexico’s supreme court invalidated sections of the policy for reliability safety continuity and quality of the national electric system we cannot predict the impact that the political social and judicial 

landscape including multiparty rule and trial resolutions will have on the mexican economy and our business in mexico such circumstances may materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects in mexico which could have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s consolidated financial statements we discuss these matters further in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency and inflation 

we have significant foreign operations in mexico which pose material foreign currency and inflation risks exchange and inflation rates with respect to the mexican peso and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on our revenue costs or cash flows from our international operations which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows our mexican subsidiary ienova has us dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities that give rise to mexican currency exchange rate movements for mexican income tax purposes it also has significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are denominated in the mexican peso and must be translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes in addition monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes we may attempt to hedge material crosscurrency transactions and earnings exposure through various means including financial instruments and shortterm investments but these hedges may not successfully achieve our objectives of mitigating earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries we are susceptible to volatility in oci caused by exchange rate fluctuations for entities whose functional currencies are not the us dollar moreover mexico has experienced periods of high inflation and exchange rate instability in the past and severe devaluation of the mexican peso could result in governmental intervention to institute restrictive exchange control policies as has occurred before in mexico and other latin american countries we discuss our foreign currency exposure at our mexican subsidiaries in “part ii – item 7 mda” and “part ii – item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

us foreign policy including trade and related matters 

all our international business activities are sensitive to geopolitical uncertainties and related factors including us foreign policy and the current us position with respect to trade relations and related matters the last us administration made substantial changes to or withdrew from trade agreements that affect our operations for example the usmca which replaced the north american free trade agreement as the principal trade agreement between the us mexico and canada went into force in july 2020 and its longterm impact on our operations remains uncertain with the current us administration having taken power in january 2021 the status of us trade policy and us involvement in international trade agreements going forward remains to be determined and could drastically shift in a manner that increases or mitigates adverse effects on our businesses the last us administration also implemented changes to us immigration policy and other policies that impact trade including increasing tariffs and the current us administration has taken steps to reverse some of these changes and could take other material action with respect to these matters such policy changes or other actions could adversely affect imports and exports between mexico and the us and negatively impact the us mexican and other economies and the companies with whom we conduct business which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

financial risks 

our businesses are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices and our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for lng facilities or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers the regional and other markets in which we purchase these commodities are competitive and can be subject to significant pricing volatility our revenues results of operations andor cash flows could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas lng electricity or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we have not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated commodities can result from multiple factors such as adverse weather conditions change in supply and demand availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources commodity production levels and storage capacity energy and environmental regulations and legislation and economic and financial market conditions among other things 

legal and regulatory risks 

our businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits and our properties in mexico could be subject to expropriation by the mexican government 

we are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the property in mexico where our eca regas facility is situated and our proposed eca lng liquefaction export projects are expected to be situated as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in addition we may have or seek to obtain longterm leases or rightsofway from governmental agencies or other third parties to operate our energy infrastructure located on land we do not own for a specific period of time if we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties we own on which our current and proposed facilities are located or if we are unable to obtain or retain rights to construct and operate our existing or proposed facilities on the properties we do not own on reasonable financial and other terms we could lose our rights to occupy and use these properties and the related facilities which could delay or derail proposed projects increase our development costs and result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts related to the affected facilities that could lead to legal costs fines or penalties in addition disputes regarding any of these properties could make project financing and finding or maintaining suitable partners and customers difficult and could hinder or halt our ability to construct and if completed operate the affected facilities or proposed projects if we are unable to occupy and use the properties and related facilities on which our existing or proposed infrastructure projects are located it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

in addition ienova’s business and assets in energy generation storage transportation and distribution may be considered by the mexican government to be a public service or essential for the provision of a public service in which case these assets and the related business could be subject to expropriation or nationalization loss of concessions renegotiation or annulment of existing contracts and other similar risks any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

risks related to our proposed ienova exchange offer and our proposed transaction related to sempra infrastructure partners 

our ability to complete our proposed ienova exchange offer is subject to various conditions and other risks and uncertainties that could cause the transaction to be abandoned delayed or restructured which could materially adversely affect us 

in december 2020 we announced our intention to launch a stockforstock exchange offer to acquire all outstanding publicly held shares of ienova the completion of this transaction is subject to governmental and regulatory consents approvals and rulings including from the sec cnbv and mexican stock exchange and other closing conditions these and other governmental and regulatory authorities may not provide the consents approvals and rulings that are needed to complete this transaction or could seek to block or challenge the transaction in addition other closing conditions to consummate the proposed transaction may not be satisfied for example the completion of the exchange offer is subject to the condition that the ienova shares validly tendered and not withdrawn together with all ienova shares that we directly or indirectly own represent no less than 95 of all of ienova’s outstanding ordinary shares determined on the basis of all outstanding ordinary shares and on a fully diluted basis although we have the right to waive this condition there is no assurance that we would do so and we have no control over the level of participation in the exchange offer by ienova’s public shareholders as a result we may decide not to complete the exchange offer if this condition is not satisfied if the required consents approvals and rulings are not received or the other closing conditions are not satisfied or waived or if any of the foregoing is not achieved in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms then the proposed exchange offer may be abandoned and our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our ability to complete the proposed exchange offer is subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties many of which are not in our control including among others if another party were to offer to acquire the publicly held shares of ienova on terms that are more favorable than the terms we offer as well as industry and market conditions these risks and uncertainties could alter the proposed structure of the transaction or negatively affect our ability to complete the transaction in a timely manner or at all 

the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks individually or in combination could lead to the abandonment delay or restructuring of the proposed exchange offer in which case we would not be able to realize the potential benefits of the transaction but would still be required to pay the substantial costs incurred in connection with pursuing it which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects and the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

the proposed exchange offer if completed may not have the positive effects we anticipate which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

we anticipate that the proposed exchange offer if completed on the currently contemplated terms will over the longterm have a positive impact on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition this expectation is based on current market conditions and is subject to a number of assumptions estimates projections and other uncertainties including assumptions about the results of operations of ienova after the proposed transaction and the costs to us to complete the transaction if the transaction is completed we may find that ienova does not perform in accordance with our expectations for a number of reasons including those we discuss above under “risks related to our businesses other than the california utilities and our interest in oncor” in addition we may fail to realize some or any of the benefits we expect from the transaction we may incur material additional transaction costs and we may be subject to other factors that cause our preliminary estimates to be incorrect as a result there is no assurance that the proposed exchange offer will positively impact our cash flows results of operations financial condition or other aspects of our performance and it is possible that the transaction may have an adverse effect which could be material on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects any of which could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

we expect to issue shares of our common stock in the proposed exchange offer which would dilute the voting interests and could dilute the economic interests of our current shareholders and may adversely affect the market value of our common stock and preferred stock 

in the proposed transaction we intend to offer to acquire up to 100 of the publicly held shares of ienova in exchange for shares of our common stock at an exchange ratio of 00313 shares of our common stock for each one ienova ordinary share which exchange ratio remains subject to approval by the sempra energy board of directors if all publicly held shares of ienova are validly tendered into and not withdrawn from this exchange offer and no ienova shares are issued after february 22 2021 then up to 13560497 shares of our common stock would be issued in the exchange offer although the exact number of shares of our common stock we may issue is uncertain and subject to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control and we may in fact issue fewer shares than anticipated the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock in this exchange offer would dilute the voting interests of our shareholders in addition the issuance of additional shares of our common stock without a commensurate increase in our consolidated earnings would decrease our eps any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 

the proposed exchange offer if completed would subject us to additional regulation and liability in mexico 

if we are able to complete the proposed exchange offer we intend to list our common stock for trading on the mexican stock exchange and register our common stock with the cnbv such listing and registration would subject us to additional filing and other requirements in mexico that could involve significant costs and materially distract our personnel from their other responsibilities in addition if we become an issuer with stock registered in mexico the cnbv as the mexican securities market regulator would have surveillance authority over sempra energy this means that the cnbv would have the authority to make inspections of sempra energy’s business primarily in the form of requests for information and documents impose fines or other penalties or sanctions for violations of mexican securities laws and regulations and seek criminal liability for actions conducted or with effects in mexico in addition sempra energy’s directors and officers would be subject to additional liability and trading restrictions with respect to their shares of sempra energy common stock under the securities laws and regulations in mexico which could make it more difficult to attract recruit and retain qualified people for these positions the occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

in addition although we intend to delist ienova’s shares from the mexican stock exchange and cancel the registration of these shares with the cnbv if the proposed exchange offer is completed such delisting and deregistration are subject to a number of requirements under applicable mexican law and regulations including the affirmative vote of no less than 95 of ienova’s ordinary shares at a shareholders’ meeting held for that purpose if we are not able to acquire sufficient shares in the exchange offer to satisfy this threshold then we likely would not be able to obtain the votes necessary to effect such delisting and deregistration in that case both sempra energy and ienova would be subject to regulation and liability as listed companies under mexican securities laws after the exchange offer is completed which would involve significant burdens on both companies that could negatively affect our businesses results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

our proposed transaction related to sempra infrastructure partners is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 

in december 2020 we announced our intention to sell nci in sempra infrastructure partners which represents the combined businesses of sempra lng and ienova our ability to complete this transaction is subject to a number of risks including among others the ability to identify a suitable partner to purchase such nci negotiate the terms of equity sale shareholder and other governance agreements with such partner and obtain governmental regulatory and thirdparty consents and approvals and satisfy any other closing conditions to complete this transaction although the structure and terms of this transaction remain to be 

determined the governmental and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the transaction could seek to block or challenge it or could impose requirements or obligations as conditions to its approval if any of these circumstances were to occur or if we are not able to achieve all of the foregoing in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms then the proposed transaction may be abandoned and our prospects could be materially adversely affected 

moreover even if we are able to complete this transaction it may not result in the benefits we presently anticipate although we expect that this transaction could over the longterm have a positive impact on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition this expectation is based on a number of assumptions estimates projections and other uncertainties about among other things the terms of the sale of nci in sempra infrastructure partners the identity of the buyer of such nci the shareholder and other governance arrangements we make with such buyer the costs to us to complete this transaction the results of operations of sempra lng and ienova after the proposed transaction and other factors beyond our control in light of the early stage of this proposed transaction there are significant uncertainties regarding its ultimate impact on our businesses and our current expectations about the potential benefits of this transaction could turn out to be wrong 

the proposed sale of nci in sempra infrastructure partners will reduce our ownership interest in sempra infrastructure partners any decrease in our ownership of sempra infrastructure partners would also decrease our share of the cash flows profits and other benefits these businesses currently or may in the future produce which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects

significant changes in revenues costs and earnings 

this section contains a discussion of the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of operations for sempra energy sdge and socalgas 

utilities revenues and cost of sales 

our utilities revenues include natural gas revenues at our california utilities and sempra mexico’s ecogas and electric revenues at sdge intercompany revenues included in the separate revenues of each utility are eliminated in the sempra energy consolidated statements of operations 

socalgas and sdge currently operate under a regulatory framework that permits 

▪ the cost of natural gas purchased for core customers primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers to be passed through to customers in rates substantially as incurred however socalgas’ gcim provides socalgas the opportunity to share in the savings andor costs from buying natural gas for its core customers at prices below or above monthly marketbased benchmarks this mechanism permits full recovery of costs incurred when average purchase costs are within a price range around the benchmark price any higher costs incurred or savings realized outside this range are shared between the core customers and socalgas 

▪ sdge to recover the actual cost incurred to generate or procure electricity based on annual estimates of the cost of electricity supplied to customers the differences in cost between estimates and actual are recovered or refunded in subsequent periods through rates 

▪ the california utilities to recover certain program expenditures and other costs authorized by the cpuc or “refundable programs” 

because changes in socalgas’ and sdge’s cost of natural gas andor electricity are recovered in rates changes in these costs are offset in the changes in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings in addition to the changes in cost or market prices natural gas or electric revenues recorded during a period are impacted by customer billing cycles causing a difference between customer billings and recorded or authorized costs these differences are required to be balanced over time resulting in over and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts 

the table below summarizes utilities revenues and cost of sales

◦ 53 million losses in 2020 compared to 40 million gains in 2019 on foreign currency derivatives as a result of fluctuation of the mexican peso and 

◦ 42 million losses in 2020 compared to 30 million gains in 2019 on a mexican pesodenominated loan to img jv which is offset in equity earnings offset by

in 2019 compared to 2018 other income net increased by 19 million 33 to 77 million primarily due to 

▪ 61 million investment gains in 2019 compared to 6 million investment losses in 2018 on dedicated assets in support of our executive retirement and deferred compensation plans and 

▪ 54 million higher net gains from interest rate and foreign exchange instruments and foreign currency transactions primarily due to

income taxes 

the table below shows the income tax expense benefit and etrs for sempra energy consolidated sdge and socalgas 



1   we discuss how we recognize equity earnings in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sempra energy consolidated 

sempra energy’s income tax expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a lower etr the change in etr was primarily due to 

▪ 44 million income tax benefit in 2020 compared to 71 million income tax expense in 2019 from foreign currency and inflation effects primarily as a result of fluctuation of the mexican peso 

▪ 26 million income tax benefit in 2020 compared to 7 million income tax expense in 2019 from changes to a valuation allowance against certain tax credit carryforwards and 

▪ 19 million income tax benefit in 2020 compared to 4 million income tax expense in 2019 related to sharebased compensation offset by 

▪ 69 million total income tax benefits in 2019 from the release of regulatory liabilities at sdge and socalgas established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the cpuc directed be allocated to shareholders in a january 2019 decision and 

▪ 10 million income tax benefit in 2019 from a reduction in a valuation allowance against certain nol carryforwards as a result of our decision to sell our south american businesses 

sempra energy’s income tax expense in 2019 compared to an income tax benefit in 2018 was due to higher pretax income and a higher etr pretax income in 2018 was impacted by the impairments at our sempra lng and sempra renewables segments offset by the gain from sale of assets at sempra renewables the change in etr was primarily due to 

▪ 131 million income tax benefit in 2018 resulting from the reduced outside basis difference in sempra lng as a result of the impairment of certain nonutility natural gas storage assets and 

▪ 45 million higher income tax expense in 2019 from foreign currency and inflation effects primarily as a result of fluctuation of the mexican peso offset by 

▪ 69 million total income tax benefits in 2019 from the release of regulatory liabilities at sdge and socalgas established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the cpuc directed be allocated to shareholders in a january 2019 decision 

▪ 41 million income tax expense in 2018 to adjust provisional estimates recorded in 2017 for the effects of tax reform 

▪ 21 million income tax expense in 2018 associated with aliso canyon natural gas storage facility litigation and 

▪ 10 million income tax benefit in 2019 from a reduction in a valuation allowance against certain nol carryforwards as a result of our decision to sell our south american businesses 

we report as part of our pretax results the income or loss attributable to nci however we do not record income taxes for a portion of this income or loss as some of our entities with nci are currently treated as partnerships for income tax purposes and thus we are only liable for income taxes on the portion of the earnings that are allocated to us our pretax income however includes 100 of these entities if our entities with nci grow and if we continue to invest in such entities the impact on our etr may become more significant 

we discuss the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and inflation on income taxes below in “impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations” see notes 1 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details about our accounting for income taxes and items subject to flowthrough treatment 

sdge 

sdge’s income tax expense increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

▪ higher pretax income and 

▪ 31 million income tax benefit in 2019 from the release of a regulatory liability established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the cpuc directed be allocated to shareholders in a january 2019 decision offset by

sdge’s income tax expense decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to a lower etr offset by higher pretax income the change in etr was primarily due to a 31 million income tax benefit in 2019 from the release of a regulatory liability established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the cpuc directed be allocated to shareholders in a january 2019 decision 

socalgas 

socalgas’ income tax expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

▪ lower pretax income and

▪ 21 million income tax expense in 2018 associated with the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility litigation 

equity earnings 

equity earnings increased by 435 million to 10 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

▪ 367 million higher equity earnings from cameron lng jv primarily due to commencement of phase 1 commercial operations 

▪ 94 million higher equity earnings at img jv primarily due to higher revenues from the start of commercial operations of the sur de texastuxpan marine pipeline and foreign currency effects including 42 million foreign currency gains in 2020 compared to 30 million foreign currency losses in 2019 on img jv’s mexican pesodenominated loans from its jv owners which is fully offset in other expense income net offset by lower afudc equity 

▪ 51 million higher equity earnings at oncor holdings primarily due to higher revenues from rate updates and customer growth the acquisition of infrareit in may 2019 and higher afudc equity offset by unfavorable weather and increased operating costs and 

▪ 23 million higher equity earnings at tag jv primarily due to lower income tax expense in 2020 offset by 

▪ 100 million equity losses at rbs sempra commodities in 2020 which represents an estimate of our obligations to settle pending tax matters and related legal costs at our equity method investment 

equity earnings increased by 405 million to 580 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to 

▪ 174 million increase at sempra renewables including 200 million otherthantemporary impairment of certain wind equity method investments in 2018

◦ 26 million decrease due to the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs and associated fees related to the jv’s debt refinancing offset by 

▪ 20 million lower equity earnings net of income tax from img jv including 30 million foreign currency losses in 2019 compared to 3 million foreign currency gains in 2018 on its mexican pesodenominated loans from its jv owners which is fully offset in other income net 

earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

earnings attributable to nci were 172 million for 2020 compared to 164 million for 2019 the net change of 8 million 5 was primarily due to an increase in earnings attributable to nci at sempra mexico mainly from foreign currency effects as a result of fluctuation of the mexico peso offset by a decrease due to the sales of our peruvian businesses in april 2020 and chilean businesses in june 2020 

earnings attributable to nci were 164 million for 2019 compared to 76 million for 2018 the net change of 88 million included 

▪ 1 million earnings attributable to nci at sempra renewables in 2019 compared to 58 million losses in 2018 primarily due to the sales of our tax equity investments in december 2018 and april 2019 and 

▪ 36 million losses attributable to nci at sempra lng in 2018 due to the net impairment of certain nonutility natural gas storage assets 

preferred dividends 

preferred dividends increased by 26 million 18 to 168 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to dividends associated with our series c preferred stock which was issued in june 2020 

preferred dividends increased by 17 million 14 to 142 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to dividends associated with our series b preferred stock which was issued in july 2018 

impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations 

because our natural gas distribution utility in mexico ecogas uses its local currency as its functional currency revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates for the period for consolidation in sempra energy consolidated’s results of operations prior to the sales of our south american businesses in 2020 our operations in south america used their local currency as their functional currency 

foreign currency translation 

any difference in average exchange rates used for the translation of income statement activity from year to year can cause a variance in sempra energy’s comparative results of operations changes in foreign currency translation rates between years resulted in 9 million lower earnings in 2020 compared to 2019 and 8 million lower earnings in 2019 compared to 2018 

transactional impacts 

income statement activities at our foreign operations and their jvs are also impacted by transactional gains and losses a summary of which is shown in the table below 



foreign currency exchange rate and inflation impacts on income taxes and related hedging activity 

our mexican subsidiaries have us dollardenominated cash balances receivables payables and debt monetary assets and liabilities that are affected by mexican currency exchange rate movements for mexican income tax purposes they also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are significant denominated in the mexican peso that must be translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes in addition monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes as a result fluctuations in both the currency exchange rate for the mexican peso against the us dollar and mexican inflation may expose us to fluctuations in income tax expense other expense income net and equity earnings we may use foreign currency derivatives as a means to help manage exposure to the currency exchange rate on our monetary assets and liabilities and this derivative activity impacts other expense income net however we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities which makes us susceptible to volatility in income tax expense caused by exchange rate fluctuations and inflation 

we also utilized foreign currency derivatives to hedge exposure to fluctuations in the peruvian sol and chilean peso related to the sales of our operations in peru and chile in discontinued operations 

other transactions 

although the financial statements of most of our mexican subsidiaries and jvs have the us dollar as the functional currency some transactions may be denominated in the local currency such transactions are remeasured into us dollars this 

remeasurement creates transactional gains and losses that are included in other expense income net for our consolidated subsidiaries and in equity earnings for our jvs 

we utilize crosscurrency swaps that exchange our mexican pesodenominated principal and interest payments into the us dollar and swap mexican variable interest rates for us fixed interest rates the impacts of these crosscurrency swaps are offset in oci and are reclassified from aoci into earnings through other expense income net and interest expense as settlements occur 

certain of our mexican pipelines namely los ramones i at ienova pipelines and los ramones norte at tag jv generate revenue based on tariffs that are set by government agencies in mexico with contracts denominated in mexican pesos that are indexed to the us dollar adjusted annually for inflation and fluctuation in the exchange rate the resultant gains and losses from remeasuring the local currency amounts into us dollars and the settlement of foreign currency forwards and swaps related to these contracts are included in revenues energyrelated businesses or equity earnings 



capital resources and liquidity 

overview 

sempra energy consolidated 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak to be a pandemic the us government officially declared a national emergency on march 13 2020 and the mexican government announced a national state of sanitary emergency on march 30 2020 the covid19 pandemic is materially impacting the economy including a surge in unemployment claims and at times substantial volatility in financial markets and has resulted in action by governments and other authorities to help address these effects for example 

▪ the cpuc required that all energy companies under its jurisdiction including the california utilities take action to implement several emergency customer protection measures to support california customers the measures currently apply to all residential and small business customers affected by the covid19 pandemic and include suspending service disconnections due to nonpayment waiving late payment fees and offering flexible payment plans to all customers experiencing difficulty paying their electric or gas bills the cpuc approved a resolution authorizing each of the california utilities to track and request recovery of incremental costs associated with complying with residential and small business customer protection measures implemented by the cpuc related to the covid19 pandemic including costs associated with suspending service disconnections and uncollectible expenses that arise from these customers’ failure to pay although we are tracking these costs in various regulatory mechanisms recovery is not assured the continuation of these circumstances could result in a further reduction in payments received from the california utilities’ customers and a further increase in uncollectible accounts which could become material and any inability or delay in recovering all or a substantial portion of these costs could have a material adverse effect on the cash flows financial condition and results of operations of sempra energy sdge and socalgas we discuss regulatory mechanisms in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

▪ in texas the puct issued orders creating the covid19 electricity relief program and suspending service disconnections due to nonpayment for customers enrolled in the program through september 30 2020 the covid19 electricity relief program created a fund through which transmission and distribution utilities and retail electric providers in texas may seek to recover certain costs including transmission and distribution utility electricity delivery charges of providing uninterrupted services to customers facing financial hardship due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic financial assistance under the program was available to enrolled residential customers for electricity bills issued on or after march 26 2020 through september 30 2020 the puct has also authorized the use of a regulatory asset accounting mechanism and a subsequent process through which regulated utility companies may seek future recovery of other expenses resulting from the effects of the covid19 pandemic rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs the regulatory assets established with respect to covid19 pandemic costs are subject to puct review for reasonableness and possible disallowance any inability to recover these costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flows financial condition and results of operations of sempra energy 

▪ on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was enacted and signed into law in response to the covid19 pandemic among other things the cares act contains significant business tax provisions including a delay of payment of employer payroll taxes and an acceleration of refunds of corporate alternative minimum tax amt credits sempra energy sdge and socalgas have deferred payment of the employer’s share of payroll taxes through the end of 2020 with half of such taxes to be paid by the end of 2021 and the other half to be paid by the end of 2022 in 2020 sempra energy filed and received a refund claim for its corporate amt credits rather than receiving it in installments through 2021 

our businesses that invest in develop and operate energy infrastructure and provide electric and gas services to customers have been identified as critical or essential services in the us and mexico and have continued to operate throughout the covid19 pandemic as our businesses continue to operate our priority is the safety of our employees customers partners and the communities we serve we and other companies including our partners are taking steps to try to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees and other stakeholders for example we have activated our business continuity plans and continue to work closely with local state and federal authorities to provide essential services with minimum interruption to customers and in accordance with applicable shelterinplace and other orders we have implemented precautionary measures across our businesses including requiring employees to work remotely when possible restricting nonessential business travel increasing facility sanitization and communicating proper health and safety protocols to employees we also have engaged an infectious disease expert to advise us during this public health crisis throughout 2020 these actions have not required significant outlays of capital and have not had a material impact on our results of operations but these or other measures that we may implement in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity cash flows financial position and results of operations if circumstances related to the covid19 pandemic worsen or continue for an extended period of time 

the covid19 pandemic and its widespread effects also have impacted our capital plans liquidity and asset values as we discuss with respect to each of our segments below we perform recovery testing of our recorded asset values when market conditions indicate that such values may not be recoverable given the current environment including the decline in the price of our common stock financial market volatility high unemployment rates reduction in customer collections that could become material inability to secure permits and other authorizations due to government closures and governments pursuing new laws or policies that modify preexisting contract terms or alter operations we evaluated whether these events or changes in circumstances resulted in an impairment of our longlived assets intangible assets or goodwill in 2020 and concluded that no such impairment was warranted however as the effects of the covid19 pandemic evolve we will continue to periodically assess the need to perform interim impairment tests a significant impairment charge related to our longlived assets intangible assets or goodwill would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 

for a further discussion of risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic see below in “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash requirements through cash flows from operations unrestricted cash and cash equivalents proceeds from recent asset sales borrowings under our credit facilities distributions from our equity method investments issuances of debt project financing and partnering in jvs we believe that these cash flow sources combined with available funds will be adequate to fund our current operations including to 

▪ finance capital expenditures 

▪ meet liquidity requirements 

▪ fund dividends 

▪ fund new business or asset acquisitions or startups 

▪ fund capital contribution requirements 

▪ repay longterm debt 

▪ fund expenditures related to the natural gas leak at socalgas’ aliso canyon natural gas storage facility 

sempra energy and the california utilities currently have reasonable access to the money markets and capital markets and are not currently constrained in their ability to borrow money at reasonable rates from commercial banks under existing revolving credit facilities or through public offerings registered with the sec however the money markets and capital markets in general including particularly the commercial paper markets and the availability of financing from commercial banks have experienced distress at times during 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets or obtain credit from commercial banks outside of our committed revolving credit facilities could become materially constrained if changing economic conditions and disruptions to the money markets and capital markets due to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise worsen in addition our financing activities and actions by credit rating agencies as well as many other factors could 

negatively affect the availability and cost of both shortterm and longterm financing also cash flows from operations may be impacted by the timing of commencement and completion and potentially cost overruns of large projects if cash flows from operations were to be significantly reduced or we were unable to borrow under acceptable terms we would likely first reduce or postpone discretionary capital expenditures not related to safety and investments in new businesses we monitor our ability to finance the needs of our operating investing and financing activities in a manner consistent with our intention to maintain our investmentgrade credit ratings and capital structure 

we have significant investments in several trusts to provide for future payments of pensions and other postretirement benefits and nuclear decommissioning changes in asset values which are dependent on activity in the equity and fixed income markets have not materially and adversely affected the trust funds’ abilities to make required payments however changes in these or other factors in future periods such as changes to discount rates assumed rates of return mortality tables and regulations may impact funding requirements for pension and other postretirement benefits plans funding requirements for sdge’s ndt could also be impacted by the timing and amount of songs decommissioning costs at the california utilities funding requirements are generally recoverable in rates we discuss our employee benefit plans and sdge’s ndt including our investment allocation strategies for assets in these trusts in notes 9 and 15 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

available funds 

our committed lines of credit provide liquidity and support commercial paper as we discuss in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sempra energy sempra global sdge and socalgas each have fiveyear credit agreements expiring in 2024 in addition sempra mexico has committed lines of credit that expire in 2021 and 2024 and an uncommitted revolving credit facility that expires in 2023 the table below shows the amount of available funds at december 31 2020 including available unused credit on these primary us and foreign lines of credit 



1 amounts at sempra energy consolidated include 295 million held in nonus jurisdictions we discuss repatriation in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

2 available unused credit is the total available on sempra energy’s sempra global’s sdge’s socalgas’ and sempra mexico’s credit facilities that we discuss in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

3 because our commercial paper programs are supported by these lines we reflect the amount of commercial paper outstanding as a reduction to the available unused credit 

shortterm borrowings 

we use shortterm debt primarily to meet liquidity requirements fund shareholder dividends and temporarily finance capital expenditures acquisitions or startups our california utilities use shortterm debt primarily to meet working capital needs due to volatility in commercial paper markets shortly following the start of the covid19 pandemic commercial paper borrowing at that time became less desirable and in some cases not competitive or unavailable to secure sufficient sources of liquidity during this period sempra energy sempra global sdge socalgas and ienova each drew amounts under their respective credit facilities and sempra energy and sdge each also obtained shortterm term loans much of which has been subsequently repaid revolving lines of credit term loans and commercial paper were our primary sources of shortterm debt funding in 2020 

we discuss our shortterm debt activities in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the following table shows selected statistics for our commercial paper borrowings 



longterm debt activities 

major issuances of and payments on longterm debt in 2020 included the following 



sdge used the proceeds from its longterm debt offerings to repay first mortgage bonds commercial paper and line of credit borrowings for working capital and for other general corporate purposes 

socalgas used the proceeds from its longterm debt offerings to repay commercial paper and for general corporate purposes 

sempra mexico used the proceeds from its issuances of longterm debt to finance the construction of solar generation projects to repay line of credit borrowings and for other general corporate purposes 

we discuss our longterm debt activities in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

credit ratings 

the credit ratings of sempra energy sdge and socalgas remained at investment grade levels in 2020 on january 29 2021 moody’s placed the longterm debt ratings of sdge on review for upgrade 



a downgrade of sempra energy’s or any of its subsidiaries’ credit ratings or rating outlooks may depending on the severity result in a requirement for collateral to be posted in the case of certain financing arrangements and may materially and adversely affect the market prices of their equity and debt securities the rates at which borrowings are made and commercial paper is issued and the various fees on their outstanding credit facilities we provide additional information about our credit ratings at sempra energy sdge and socalgas in “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

sempra energy has agreed that if the credit rating of oncor’s senior secured debt by any of the three major rating agencies falls below bbb or the equivalent oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions except for contractual tax payments unless otherwise allowed by the puct oncor’s senior secured debt was rated a2 a and a at moody’s sp and fitch respectively at december 31 2020 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas have committed lines of credit to provide liquidity and to support commercial paper borrowings under these facilities bear interest at benchmark rates plus a margin that varies with market index rates and each borrower’s credit rating each facility also requires a commitment fee on available unused credit that may be impacted by each borrower’s credit rating depending on the severity of the downgrade 

▪ if sempra energy were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 25 to 50 bps the commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 5 to 10 bps 

▪ if sdge were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 25 to 50 bps the commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 5 to 10 bps 

▪ if socalgas were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 125 bps the commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 25 bps 

sempra energy’s and sdge’s credit ratings also may affect their respective credit limits related to derivative instruments as we discuss in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

loans tofrom affiliates 

at december 31 2020 sempra energy had 780 million in loans due from unconsolidated affiliates and 275 million in loans due to unconsolidated affiliates 

california utilities 

sdge’s and socalgas’ operations have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity their future performance and liquidity will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process environmental regulations economic conditions actions by the california legislature litigation and the changing energy marketplace as well as other matters described in this report 

sdge and socalgas expect that the available unused credit from their credit facilities described above cash flows from operations and debt issuances will continue to be adequate to fund their respective current operations and planned capital expenditures the california utilities are continuing to monitor the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on cash flows and results of operations some customers are experiencing a diminished ability to pay their electric or gas bills leading to slower payments and higher levels of nonpayment than has been the case historically these impacts could become significant and could require modifications to our financing plans the california utilities manage their capital structure and pay dividends when appropriate and as approved by their respective boards of directors 

as we discuss in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements changes in balancing accounts for significant costs at sdge and socalgas particularly a change between over and undercollected status may have a significant impact on cash flows these changes generally represent the difference between when costs are incurred and when they are ultimately recovered in rates through billings to customers 

disconnection oir 

in june 2020 the cpuc issued a decision addressing service disconnections that among other things allows each of the california utilities to establish a twoway balancing account to record the uncollectible expenses associated with residential customers’ inability to pay their electric or gas bills this decision also directs the california utilities to establish an amp that provides successfully participating incomequalified residential customers with relief from outstanding utility bill amounts and is effective as of february 2021 the california utilities have recorded increases in their allowances for uncollectible accounts at december 31 2020 primarily related to expected forgiveness of outstanding bill amounts for customers eligible under the amp the amp could result in a further reduction in payments received from the california utilities’ customers and a further increase to uncollectible accounts which could become material and any inability to recover these costs could have a material adverse effect on the cash flows financial condition and results of operations of sempra energy sdge and socalgas 

pipeline safety enhancement plan 

in november 2018 socalgas and sdge filed a joint application with the cpuc for a reasonableness review of psep project costs totaling 941 million for 83 pipeline safety enhancement projects socalgas and sdge subsequently entered into a settlement agreement for cost recovery of 935 million 806 million for socalgas and 129 million for sdge a final decision was approved in august 2020 granting the proposed settlement agreement as well as the amortization schedule for recovery of costs the final decision was implemented in rates on october 1 2020 

ccm 

a cpuc cost of capital proceeding determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base and addresses the ccm the ccm if triggered in 2021 would be effective january 1 2022 and would automatically update the california utilities’ authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and update the california utilities’ authorized roe a trigger of the ccm that requires a downward adjustment beginning january 1 2022 could materially adversely affect the results of operations and cash flows of sempra energy and depending on the ccm that is triggered sdge and socalgas we discuss the ccm further in “part i – item 1 business – ratemaking mechanisms – california utilities – cost of capital proceedings” “part i – item 1a risk factors” and in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sdge 

wildfire fund 

in 2019 sdge recorded a wildfire fund asset for committed shareholder contributions to the wildfire fund we describe the wildfire legislation and related accounting treatment in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sdge is exposed to the risk that the participating california electric ious may incur thirdparty wildfire claims for which they will seek recovery from the wildfire fund in such a situation sdge may recognize a reduction of its wildfire fund asset and record a charge against earnings in the period when there is a reduction of the available coverage due to recoverable claims from any of the participating ious as a result if any california electric iou’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire it could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s financial condition and results of operations up to the carrying value of our wildfire fund asset with additional potential material exposure if sdge’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire in addition the wildfire fund could be completely exhausted due to fires in the other california electric ious’ service territories by fires in sdge’s service territory or by a combination thereof in 2020 california experienced some of the largest wildfires in its history measured by acres burned including fires in sdge’s service territory although sdge is not aware of any claims made against the wildfire fund by any participating iou there is no assurance that the equipment of a california electric iou will not be determined to be a cause of one or more of these fires in the event that the wildfire fund is materially diminished exhausted or terminated sdge will lose the protection afforded by the wildfire fund and as a consequence a fire in sdge’s service territory could cause a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

socalgas 

socalgas’ future performance and liquidity will be impacted by the resolution of legal regulatory and other matters concerning the leak which we discuss below in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

aliso canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak 

from october 23 2015 through february 11 2016 socalgas experienced a natural gas leak from one of the injectionandwithdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility located in los angeles county in february 2016 calgem confirmed that the well was permanently sealed 

cost estimates accounting impact and insurance at december 31 2020 socalgas estimates certain costs related to the leak are 1627 million the cost estimate this cost estimate may increase significantly as more information becomes available a substantial portion of the cost estimate has been paid and 451 million is accrued as reserve for aliso canyon costs on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s consolidated balance sheets 

except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions the cost estimate does not include litigation or regulatory costs to the extent it is not possible to predict at this time the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the costs to defend or resolve the actions or the amount of damages restitution or civil administrative or criminal fines sanctions penalties or other costs or remedies that may be imposed or incurred the cost estimate also does not include certain other costs incurred by sempra energy associated with defending against shareholder derivative lawsuits and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate these costs not included in the cost estimate could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

we have received insurance payments for many of the costs included in the cost estimate including temporary relocation and associated processing costs controlofwell expenses costs of the governmentordered response to the leak certain legal costs and lost gas as of december 31 2020 we recorded the expected recovery of the cost estimate related to the leak of 445 million as insurance receivable for aliso canyon costs on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s consolidated balance sheets this amount is exclusive of insurance retentions and 834 million of insurance proceeds we received through december 31 2020 we intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for the costs we have incurred other than insurance for certain future defense costs we may incur as well as directors’ and officers’ liability we have exhausted all of our insurance in this matter we continue to pursue other sources of insurance coverage for costs related to this matter but we may not be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for any of these costs if we are not able to secure additional insurance recovery if any costs we have recorded as an insurance receivable are not collected if there are delays in receiving insurance recoveries or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible such amounts which could be significant could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

natural gas storage operations and reliability natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods including peak electric generation needs in the summer and consumer heating needs in the winter the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility is the largest socalgas storage facility and an important element of socalgas’ delivery system as a result of the leak socalgas suspended injection of natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility beginning in october 2015 and following a comprehensive safety review and authorization by calgem and the cpuc’s executive director resumed injection operations in july 2017 based on limited operating ranges for the field in february 2017 the cpuc opened a proceeding pursuant to sb 380 oii to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region including considering alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility’s services if it were eliminated 

the cpuc has issued a series of directives to socalgas specifying the range of working gas to be maintained in the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility as well as protocols for the withdrawal of gas to support safe and reliable natural gas service withdrawals of natural gas from the facility were made in 2018 2019 and 2020 to augment natural gas supplies to meet consumer demand including for electric generation needs 

if the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value it could result in an impairment of the facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs andor additional capital expenditures and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized at december 31 2020 the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of 821 million any significant impairment of this asset or higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas that may not be recoverable in customer rates could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

oscs – energy efficiency and advocacy 

as we discuss in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in october 2019 the cpuc issued an osc to determine whether socalgas should be sanctioned for violation of certain cpuc code sections and orders related to energy efficiency codes and standards advocacy activities undertaken by socalgas in 2018 in december 2019 the cpuc issued a second osc to determine whether socalgas is entitled to the energy efficiency program’s shareholder incentives for codes and standards advocacy in 2016 and 2017 whether its shareholders should bear the costs of those advocacy activities and to address whether any other remedies are appropriate the scope of this second osc was later expanded to include energy efficiency program years 2014 and 2015 and socalgas’ engagement with local governments on proposed reach codes if the cpuc were to assess fines or penalties on socalgas associated with these oscs they could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and 

sempra energy’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows we expect cpuc decisions on these oscs in the first half of 2021 

sempra texas utilities 

oncor relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements in the past oncor has financed a substantial portion of its cash needs from operations and with proceeds from indebtedness in the event that oncor fails to meet its capital requirements or is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs we may elect to make additional capital contributions to oncor as our commitments to the puct prohibit us from making loans to oncor which could be substantial and which would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations liquidity financial condition and prospects 

oncor’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by factors such as its credit ratings regulatory capital requirements debttoequity ratio approved by the puct and other restrictions in addition oncor will not pay dividends if a majority of oncor’s independent directors or any minority member director determines it is in the best interests of oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements 

sempra mexico 

construction projects and related regulatory matters 

sempra mexico is currently constructing additional terminals for the receipt storage and delivery of liquid fuels in the vicinity of mexico city puebla veracruz and topolobampo sempra mexico is also constructing a new solar facility border solar in juárez chihuahua through which it intends to supply renewable energy to several private companies sempra mexico is currently developing additional terminals for the receipt storage and delivery of liquid fuels in the vicinity of manzanillo guadalajara and ensenada we expect to fund these capital expenditures investments and operations at ienova with available funds including credit facilities and funds internally generated by the sempra mexico businesses as well as funds from project financing sales of securities interim funding from the parent or affiliates and partnering in jvs we expect the projects under construction to commence commercial operations on various dates in 2021 however expected commencement dates could be delayed by worsening or extended disruptions of project construction or development caused by the covid19 pandemic or other factors outside our control sempra mexico is continuing to monitor the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on cash flows and results of operations see “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the second quarter of 2020 certain mexican governmental agencies issued orders and regulations that would reduce or limit the renewable energy sector’s participation in the country’s energy market those orders would among other things create barriers for renewable energy facilities to enter the wholesale electricity market prevent renewable energy projects currently in construction from reaching operations and increase grid fees for legacy renewables and cogeneration energy contract holders ienova and other companies affected by such measures certain nongovernmental environmental organizations or advocacy groups and cofece mexico’s antitrust regulator have filed legal complaints with the respective mexican courts to prevent such measures from going into effect in most cases the courts have sided with the complainants and such measures have been stayed temporarily the courtordered injunctions provide relief until mexico’s federal district court ultimately resolves the amparo claims constitutional protection lawsuits 

an unfavorable final decision on these amparo challenges or the potential for an extended dispute could impact our ability to successfully complete construction of our border solar project which is not yet commercially operating or to complete such construction in a timely manner and within expected budgets may impact our ability to operate our wind and solar facilities already in service at existing levels or at all and may adversely affect our ability to develop new projects any of which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows and our ability to recover the carrying values of our renewable energy investments in mexico 

the ability to successfully complete major construction projects is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties see “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

other legal and regulatory matters 

as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements ienova received force majeure payments for the guaymasel oro segment of the sonora pipeline from august 2017 to august 2019 under an agreement between ienova and the cfe the cfe will resume making payments only when the damaged section of the guaymasel oro segment of the sonora pipeline is repaired if the pipeline is not repaired by march 14 2021 and the parties do not agree on a new service start date ienova retains the right to terminate the contract and seek to recover its reasonable and documented costs and lost profits if ienova is unable to make such repairs which have not commenced and resume operations in the guaymasel oro segment of 

the sonora pipeline or if ienova terminates the contract and is unable to obtain recovery there may be a material adverse impact on sempra energy’s results of operations and cash flows and our ability to recover the carrying value of our investment at december 31 2020 the guaymasel oro segment of the sonora pipeline had a net book value of 447 million the sasabepuerto libertadguaymas segment of the sonora pipeline remains in full operation and is not impacted by these developments 

in may 2020 the two thirdparty capacity customers at the eca regas facility shell mexico and gazprom asserted that a 2019 update of the general terms and conditions for service at the facility as approved by the cre resulted in a breach of contract by ienova and a force majeure event citing these circumstances the customers subsequently stopped making payments of amounts due under their respective lng storage and regasification agreements ienova has rejected the customers’ assertions and has drawn and expects to continue to draw on the customers’ letters of credit provided as payment security the parties engaged in discussions under the applicable contractual dispute resolution procedures without coming to a mutually acceptable resolution in july 2020 shell mexico submitted a request for arbitration of the dispute and although gazprom has joined the proceeding gazprom has replenished the amounts drawn on its letter of credit and has resumed making regular monthly payments under its lng storage and regasification agreement ienova intends to avail itself of its available claims defenses rights and remedies in the arbitration proceeding including seeking dismissal of the customers’ claims in addition to the arbitration proceeding shell mexico also filed a constitutional challenge to the cre’s approval of the update to the general terms and conditions in october 2020 shell mexico’s request to stay cre’s approval was denied and subsequently shell mexico filed an appeal of that decision 

potential acquisition of esj 

as we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in february 2021 ienova agreed to acquire saavi energía’s 50 interest in esj for approximately 83 million at december 31 2020 ienova owned a 50 interest in esj which is accounted for as an equity method investment upon completion of the acquisition ienova will own 100 of esj and will consolidate it we expect to complete the acquisition in the first half of 2021 subject to various closing conditions including authorizations from the ferc and cofece 

esj is constructing a second wind power generation facility which we expect will be completed in late 2021 or in the first quarter of 2022 and will have a nameplate capacity of 108 mw 

exchange offer 

on december 2 2020 we announced a nonbinding offer to acquire up to 100 of the publicly held shares of ienova in exchange for shares of our common stock at an exchange ratio of 00313 shares of our common stock for each one ienova ordinary share which exchange ratio remains subject to approval by the sempra energy board of directors we expect to complete this transaction in the second quarter of 2021 subject to authorization by the sec cnbv and mexican stock exchange and other closing conditions this proposed transaction is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

ienova common stock repurchase fund 

in april 2020 ienova’s shareholders approved an increase to a previously approved fund for ienova to repurchase shares of its common stock for a maximum amount of 500 million increased from 250 million as of february 25 2021 ienova has repurchased 81742780 shares of its outstanding common stock held by nci for approximately 248 million since the inception of the fund in 2018 increasing sempra energy’s ownership interest in ienova from 666 to 702 over this period ienova does not intend to repurchase shares of its common stock during the pendency of the exchange offer described above following the completion of the exchange offer ienova may repurchase shares under the existing program from timetotime at the discretion of management 

sempra lng 

sempra lng is pursuing development of additional lng export facilities on the gulf coast and pacific coast of north america through its proposed cameron lng jv phase 2 liquefaction expansion project in louisiana eca lng liquefaction export projects in mexico and port arthur lng liquefaction export project in texas we expect sempra lng to require funding for the development and expansion of its portfolio of projects which may be financed through a combination of operating cash flows funding from the parent project financing and participating in jvs 

cameron lng jv threetrain liquefaction project phase 1 

sempra lng through its 502 interest in cameron lng jv operates a threetrain natural gas liquefaction facility with an export capacity of 12 mtpa of lng which we refer to as phase 1 the majority of the construction was projectfinanced at the jv with most or all of the remainder of the capital requirements provided by the project partners including sempra energy 

through equity contributions under the project equity agreements cameron lng jv achieved commercial operations of train 1 train 2 and train 3 under its tolling agreements in august 2019 february 2020 and august 2020 respectively 

as we discuss below in “offbalance sheet arrangements” and in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sempra energy has guaranteed a maximum of  40 billion related to cameron lng jv’s project financing and financingrelated agreements for the phase 1 project these guarantees terminate upon cameron lng jv achieving “financial completion” of the phase 1 threetrain liquefaction export project including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests which are currently underway cameron lng jv’s financing agreements contain events of default customary for such financings including a failure to achieve financial completion of the project by a deadline of september 30 2021 with up to an additional 365 days extension beyond such date permitted in cases of force majeure pursuant to the financing agreements cameron lng jv is restricted from making distributions to its project owners including sempra lng from january 1 2021 until the earlier of september 30 2021 and the achievement of financial completion at which time any deferred distributions will be released a delay that results in a failure to achieve financial completion by september 30 2021 would result in an event of default under cameron lng jv’s financing agreements and a potential demand on sempra energy’s guarantees we anticipate that the guarantees will be terminated in the first half of 2021 but this timing could be delayed perhaps substantially if the operational performance tests required to achieve financial completion are not completed due to weatherrelated events other events or other factors beyond our control if due to cameron lng jv’s failure to satisfy the financial completion criteria by the applicable deadline we are required to repay some or all of the  40 billion under our guarantees any such repayments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

for a discussion of our investment in cameron lng jv jv financing sempra energy guarantees the risks discussed above and other risks relating to the cameron lng jv phase 1 liquefaction export project that could adversely affect our future performance see “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

cameron lng jv liquefaction expansion project phase 2 

cameron lng jv has received the major permits and fta and nonfta approvals necessary to expand the current configuration of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project beyond phase 1 the permits obtained for the phase 2 project include up to two additional liquefaction trains and up to two additional full containment lng storage tanks one of which was permitted with the phase 1 threetrain project 

sempra energy has entered mous with total se mitsui  co ltd and mitsubishi corporation that provide a framework for cooperation for the development of and 100 of the offtake from the potential cameron lng jv phase 2 project the ultimate participation of and offtake by total se mitsui  co ltd and mitsubishi corporation remains subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements among other factors and total se mitsui  co ltd and mitsubishi corporation have no commitment to participate in or enter into offtake agreements with the phase 2 project until such definitive agreements are established 

expansion of the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the jv project financing agreements including among others timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the phase 1 project lenders under the cameron lng jv equity agreements the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all the partners including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner discussions among all the cameron lng jv partners have been taking place regarding how an expansion may be structured and we expect that discussions will continue there is no assurance that the cameron lng jv members will unanimously agree in a timely manner or at all on an expansion structure which if not accomplished would materially and adversely impact the development of the phase 2 expansion project in light of this and other considerations we are unable to predict whether or when cameron lng jv might be able to move forward on the phase 2 expansion of the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains 

the development of the potential cameron lng jv phase 2 expansion project is subject to numerous other risks and uncertainties including securing binding customer commitments reaching unanimous agreement with our partners to proceed obtaining a number of permits and regulatory approvals securing financing negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including a definitive epc contract equity acquisition and governance agreements reaching a final investment decision and other factors associated with this potential investment for a discussion of these risks see “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

eca lng liquefaction export projects 

sempra lng and ienova are developing two natural gas liquefaction export projects at ienova’s existing eca regas facility the liquefaction export projects which are planned for development in two phases a midscale project referred to as eca lng phase 1 and a proposed largescale project referred to as eca lng phase 2 are being developed to provide buyers with direct access to north american west coast lng supplies we do not expect the construction of the eca lng phase 1 project to disrupt operations at the eca regas facility however construction of the eca lng phase 2 project would conflict with the current operations at the eca regas facility which currently has longterm regasification contracts for 100 of the regasification facility’s capacity through 2028 making the decisions on whether and how to pursue the eca lng phase 2 project dependent in part on whether the investment in a largescale liquefaction facility would over the long term be more beneficial financially than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts we have planned measures to not disrupt operations at the eca regas facility with the construction of the eca lng phase 1 project 

in march 2019 eca lng received two authorizations from the doe to export usproduced natural gas to mexico and to reexport lng to nonfta countries from its eca lng phase 1 project which is a onetrain natural gas liquefaction facility with a nameplate capacity of 325 mtpa and initial offtake capacity of approximately 25 mtpa that is under construction and its proposed eca lng phase 2 project that is in development 

in april 2020 eca lng phase 1 executed definitive 20year lng sale and purchase agreements with mitsui  co ltd for approximately 08 mtpa of lng and with an affiliate of total se for approximately 17 mtpa of lng in december 2020 an affiliate of total se acquired a 166 ownership interest in eca lng phase 1 with sempra lng and ienova each retaining a 417 ownership interest our mou with mitsui  co ltd provides a framework for mitsui  co ltd’s potential offtake of lng from and potential acquisition of an equity interest in eca lng phase 2 

in february 2020 we entered into an epc contract with technipfmc for the engineering procurement and construction of the eca lng phase 1 project since reaching a final investment decision with respect to the project in november 2020 we released technipfmc to commence work to construct the eca lng phase 1 project the total price of the epc contract is estimated at approximately 15 billion we estimate that capital expenditures will approximate 20 billion including capitalized interest and project contingency the actual cost of the epc contract and the actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ perhaps substantially from our estimates 

in december 2020 eca lng phase 1 entered into a fiveyear loan agreement for an aggregate principal amount of up to 16 billion of which 17 million was outstanding at december 31 2020 proceeds from the loan are being used to finance the cost of construction of the eca lng phase 1 project we discuss the details of this loan in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the construction of the eca lng phase 1 project and the development of the potential eca lng phase 2 project are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties for phase 1 these include maintaining permits and regulatory approvals construction delays securing and maintaining commercial arrangements such as gas supply and transportation agreements and other factors associated with the project and its construction for phase 2 these include obtaining binding customer commitments the receipt of a number of permits and regulatory approvals obtaining financing negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including a definitive epc contract equity acquisition and governance agreements lng sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements reaching a final investment decision and other factors associated with this potential investment in addition as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements an unfavorable decision on certain property disputes or permit challenges or an extended dispute with existing customers at the eca regas facility could materially and adversely affect the development of these projects and sempra energy’s financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects including the impairment of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in the projects to date for a discussion of these risks see “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

port arthur lng liquefaction export project 

sempra lng is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction export project on a greenfield site that it owns in the vicinity of port arthur texas located along the sabineneches waterway sempra lng received authorizations from the doe in august 2015 and may 2019 that collectively permit the lng to be produced from the proposed port arthur lng project to be exported to all current and future fta and nonfta countries 

in april 2019 the ferc approved the siting construction and operation of the proposed port arthur lng liquefaction facility along with certain natural gas pipelines including the louisiana connector and texas connector pipelines that could be used to supply feed gas to the liquefaction facility assuming the project is completed in february 2020 sempra lng filed a ferc application for the siting construction and operation of a second phase at the proposed port arthur lng facility including the potential addition of two liquefaction trains 

in february 2020 we entered into an epc contract with bechtel for the proposed port arthur lng liquefaction project the epc contract contemplates the construction of two liquefaction trains with a nameplate capacity of approximately 135 mtpa two lng storage tanks a marine berth and associated loading facilities and related infrastructure necessary to provide liquefaction services we have no obligation to move forward on the epc contract and we may release bechtel to perform portions of the work pursuant to limited notices to proceed we plan to fully release bechtel to perform all of the work to construct the port arthur lng liquefaction export project only after we reach a final investment decision with respect to the project and after certain other conditions are met including obtaining project financing in december 2020 we amended and restated the epc contract to reflect an estimated price of approximately 87 billion depending on the timing of a full notice to proceed which if not issued by july 15 2021 will require renegotiation of the epc contract any changes to the epc contract will require the agreement of both parties which cannot be assured 

in december 2018 polish oil  gas company pgnig and port arthur lng entered into a definitive 20year agreement for the sale and purchase of 2 mtpa of lng per year from the port arthur lng liquefaction export project under the agreement lng purchases by pgnig from port arthur lng will be made on a freeonboard basis with pgnig responsible for shipping the lng from the port arthur facility to the final destination port arthur lng will manage the gas pipeline transportation liquefaction processing and cargo loading the agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent including port arthur lng making a positive final investment decision within certain agreed timelines the failure of these conditions precedent to be satisfied or waived within the agreed timelines could result in the termination of the agreement 

in may 2019 aramco services company and sempra lng signed a heads of agreement for the negotiation of a definitive 20year lng sale and purchase agreement for 5 mtpa of lng offtake from the port arthur lng liquefaction export project the heads of agreement also includes the negotiation of a potential 25 equity investment in the project in january 2020 aramco services company and sempra lng signed an interim project participation agreement which sets forth certain mechanisms for the parties to work towards receipt of corporate approvals to enter into and proceed with the transaction execution of the transaction agreements and the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions precedent contemplated by these agreements making a final investment decision and other prefinal investment decision activities the heads of agreement and interim project participation agreement do not obligate the parties to ultimately execute any agreements or participate in the project 

in november 2019 port arthur lng commenced the relocation and upgrade of approximately three miles of highway where the port arthur lng liquefaction export project would be located 

we continue to work on completing all necessary milestones so that we are prepared to make a final investment decision for the proposed port arthur lng liquefaction export project when appropriate the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy and uncertainty in the energy and financial markets among other reasons have delayed the expected timing of our final investment decision until 2021 

development of the port arthur lng liquefaction export project is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including obtaining additional customer commitments completing the required commercial agreements such as equity acquisitions and governance agreements lng sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements completing construction contracts securing all necessary permits and approvals obtaining financing and incentives reaching a final investment decision and other factors associated with the potential investment an unfavorable outcome with respect to any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s financial condition results of operations and prospects including the impairment of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in the project to date for a discussion of these risks see “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

proposed sempra infrastructure partners transaction 

in december 2020 we announced our intention to sell nci in sempra infrastructure partners which represents the combined businesses of sempra lng and ienova we expect to complete this transaction in the second quarter of 2021 we intend to use the expected proceeds from the proposed sale of nci to fund capital investments to support additional growth opportunities and strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt 

the proposed sale of nci in sempra infrastructure partners will reduce our ownership interest in sempra infrastructure partners any decrease in our ownership of sempra infrastructure partners would also decrease our share of the cash flows profits and other benefits these businesses currently or may in the future produce which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

our ability to complete this transaction is subject to a number of risks including among others the ability to identify a suitable partner to purchase such nci negotiate the terms of equity sale shareholder and other governance agreements with such partner and obtain governmental regulatory and thirdparty consents and approvals and satisfy any other closing conditions to complete 

this transaction although the structure and terms of this transaction remain to be determined the governmental and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the transaction could seek to block or challenge it or could impose requirements or obligations as conditions to its approval if any of these circumstances were to occur or if we are not able to achieve all of the foregoing in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms then the proposed transaction may be abandoned and our prospects could be materially adversely affected this transaction is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that we discuss further in “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

discontinued operations 

in april 2020 we completed the sale of our equity interests in our peruvian businesses for cash proceeds of 3549 million net of transaction costs and as adjusted for postclosing adjustments in june 2020 we completed the sale of our equity interests in our chilean businesses for cash proceeds of 2216 million net of transaction costs and as adjusted for postclosing adjustments 

our utilities in south america historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity we used a portion of the proceeds from the sales of these businesses to strengthen our balance sheet by repaying certain borrowings and repurchasing shares of our common stock and we intend to use the remaining proceeds to focus on capital investment in north america to support additional growth opportunities we expect the cash provided by earnings from our capital investments will exceed the absence of cash flows from these discontinued operations however there is no assurance that we will derive these anticipated benefits further there is no assurance that we will be able to redeploy the capital that we obtained from such sales in a way that results in cash flows or earnings exceeding those historically generated by these businesses 

sources and uses of cash 

the following tables include only significant changes in cash flow activities for each of our registrants 







expenditures for ppe 

we invest the majority of our capital expenditures in the california utilities primarily for transmission and distribution improvements including pipeline and wildfire safety the following table summarizes by segment capital expenditures for the last three years 



expenditures for investments and acquisitions 

in 2019 and 2018 we invested heavily in our sempra texas utilities which included our march 2018 acquisition of oncor holdings and subsequent contributions to oncor holdings primarily to fund oncor’s purchase of infrareit in may 2019 the following table summarizes by segment our investments in various jvs as well as business and asset acquisitions 



future capital expenditures and investments 

the amounts and timing of capital expenditures and certain investments are generally subject to approvals by various regulatory and other governmental and environmental bodies including the cpuc the ferc and the puct and various other factors described in this mda and in “part i – item 1a risk factors” in 2021 we expect to make capital expenditures and investments of approximately 58 billion which excludes capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities as summarized by segment in the following table 



we expect the majority of our capital expenditures and investments in 2021 will relate to transmission and distribution improvements at our regulated public utilities the eca lng phase 1 liquefaction export project at sempra lng and construction of liquid fuels terminals at sempra mexico 

from 2021 through 2025 and subject to the factors described below which could cause these estimates to vary substantially sempra energy expects to make aggregate capital expenditures and investments of approximately 225 billion which excludes 

capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities as follows 96 billion at sdge 92 billion at socalgas 06 billion at sempra texas utilities 11 billion at sempra mexico and 20 billion at sempra lng capital expenditure amounts include capitalized interest and afudc related to debt 

periodically we review our construction investment and financing programs and revise them in response to changes in regulation economic conditions competition customer growth inflation customer rates the cost and availability of capital and safety and environmental requirements 

our level of capital expenditures and investments in the next few years may vary substantially and will depend on among other things the cost and availability of financing regulatory approvals changes in us federal tax law and business opportunities providing desirable rates of return see “part i – item 1a risk factors” for a discussion of other factors that could affect future levels of our capital expenditures and investments we intend to finance our capital expenditures in a manner that will maintain our investmentgrade credit ratings and capital structure but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so

on february 23 2021 our board of directors approved an increase in sempra energy’s quarterly common stock dividend to 110 per share 440 annually the first of which is payable april 15 2021 in addition on february 23 2021 our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of 16875 per share on our series b preferred stock and semiannual dividends of 24375 per share on our series c preferred stock both payable on april 15 2021 all declarations of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock are made at the discretion of the board of directors while we view dividends as an integral component of shareholder return the amount of future dividends will depend on earnings cash flows financial and legal requirements and other relevant factors at that time as a result sempra energy’s dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis including recent historical increases may not be indicative of future declarations 

sdge 

in 2020 and 2018 sdge paid common stock dividends to enova and enova paid corresponding dividends to sempra energy of 200 million and 250 million respectively sdge did not declare or pay common stock dividends in 2019 sdge’s dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for sdge to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program 

enova a wholly owned subsidiary of sempra energy owns all of sdge’s outstanding common stock accordingly dividends paid by sdge to enova and dividends paid by enova to sempra energy are eliminated in sempra energy’s consolidated financial statements 

socalgas 

in 2020 2019 and 2018 socalgas paid common stock dividends to pe and pe paid corresponding dividends to sempra energy of 100 million 150 million and 50 million respectively socalgas’ dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for socalgas to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program 

pe a wholly owned subsidiary of sempra energy owns all of socalgas’ outstanding common stock accordingly dividends paid by socalgas to pe and dividends paid by pe to sempra energy are eliminated in sempra energy’s consolidated financial statements 

dividend restrictions 

the board of directors for each of sempra energy sdge and socalgas has the discretion to determine whether to declare and if declared the amount of any dividends by each such entity the cpuc’s regulation of sdge’s and socalgas’ capital structures limits the amounts that are available for loans and dividends to sempra energy at december 31 2020 based on these regulations sempra energy could have received combined loans and dividends of approximately 717 million from sdge and 148 million from socalgas 

we provide additional information about dividend restrictions in “restricted net assets” in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

book value per common share 

sempra energy’s book value per common share on the last day of each of the last three fiscal years was as follows 

▪ 7011 in 2020 

▪ 6058 in 2019 

▪ 5435 in 2018 

the increase in 2020 was primarily due to comprehensive income exceeding dividends offset by common stock repurchases in 2019 the increase was primarily due to comprehensive income exceeding dividends and common stock issuances 

capitalization 

our debt to capitalization ratio calculated as total debt as a percentage of total debt and equity was as follows 



significant changes in 2020 that affected capitalization included the following 

▪ sempra energy consolidated decrease in shortterm debt and increase in equity from issuances of common and preferred stock and comprehensive income exceeding dividends 

▪ sdge increase in longterm debt and increase in equity from comprehensive income exceeding dividends 

▪ socalgas increase in longterm debt and increase in equity from comprehensive income exceeding dividends 

commitments 

the following tables summarize undiscounted principal contractual commitments at december 31 2020 for sempra energy consolidated sdge and socalgas we provide additional information about commitments above and in notes 1 7 9 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 



1 we calculate expected interest payments using the stated interest rate for fixedrate obligations including floatingtofixed interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps we calculate expected interest payments for variablerate obligations based on forecast rates in effect at december 31 2020 

2   includes 30 million of estimated variable payments 

3 sempra lng has a sale and purchase agreement for the supply of lng to the eca regas facility the commitment amount is calculated using a predetermined formula based on estimated forward prices of the index applicable from 2021 to 2029 

4 amounts represent expected company contributions to the plans for the next 10 years 

5 excludes amounts related to the leak that are recorded in reserve for aliso canyon costs and that are not currently known or reasonably estimable 



1 sdge calculates expected interest payments using the stated interest rate for fixedrate obligations we calculate expected interest payments for variablerate obligations based on forecast rates in effect at december 31 2020

2 excludes amounts related to the leak 

3 amounts represent expected socalgas contributions to the plans for the next 10 years 

the tables above exclude contracts between consolidated affiliates intercompany debt and employment contracts 

the tables also exclude income tax liabilities at december 31 2020 of 

▪ 99 million for sempra energy consolidated 

▪ 13 million for sdge 

▪ 68 million for socalgas 

these liabilities relate to uncertain tax positions and were excluded from the tables because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of future payments due to uncertainties in the effective settlement of tax positions we provide additional information about unrecognized income tax benefits in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have bilateral unsecured standby letter of credit capacity with select lenders that is uncommitted and supported by reimbursement agreements at december 31 2020 we had approximately 508 million in standby letters of credit outstanding under these agreements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in august 2014 and december 2019 sempra energy provided guarantees for 502 of cameron lng jv’s financing obligations for a maximum amount of up to 40 billion the guarantees will terminate upon satisfaction of certain conditions including all three trains achieving financial completion by september 30 2021 with up to an additional 365day extension beyond such date permitted in cases of force majeure however if cameron lng jv fails to satisfy the financial completion criteria a demand could be made under the guarantee for sempra energy’s 502 share of cameron lng jv’s obligations under the financing arrangements then due and payable which could have a material adverse impact on sempra energy’s liquidity we discuss these guarantees above in “overview – sempra lng – cameron lng jv threetrain liquefaction project phase 1” in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “part i – item 1a risk factors” 

in july 2020 sempra energy entered into a support agreement which contains a guarantee and represents a variable interest for the benefit of cfin with a maximum exposure to loss of 979 million the guarantee will terminate upon full repayment of the guaranteed debt by 2039 including repayment following an event in which the guaranteed debt is put to sempra energy we discuss this guarantee in notes 1 6 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sdge has entered into ppas and tolling agreements that are variable interests our investments in oncor holdings and cameron lng jv are variable interests sempra energy’s other businesses may also enter into arrangements that could include variable interests we discuss variable interests in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

management views certain accounting policies as critical because their application is the most relevant judgmental andor material to our financial position and results of operations andor because they require the use of material judgments and estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss choices among alternative accounting policies that are material to our financial statements and information concerning significant estimates with the audit committee of the sempra energy board of directors 

contingencies 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

we accrue losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes for loss contingencies we accrue the loss if an event has occurred on or before the balance sheet date and 

▪ information available through the date we file our financial statements indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred given the likelihood of uncertain future events 

▪ the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 

we do not accrue contingencies that might result in gains we continuously assess contingencies for litigation claims environmental remediation and other events 

details of our issues in this area are discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

regulatory accounting 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

as regulated entities the california utilities’ customer rates as set and monitored by regulators are designed to recover the cost of providing service and provide the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investments the california utilities record regulatory assets which are generally costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that through the ratemaking process the utility will recover that asset from customers in future rates similarly regulatory liabilities are recorded for amounts recovered in rates in advance or in excess of costs incurred the california utilities assess probabilities of future rate recovery associated with regulatory account balances at the end of each reporting period and whenever new andor unusual events occur such as 

▪ changes in the regulatory and political environment or the utility’s competitive position 

▪ issuance of a regulatory commission order 

▪ passage of new legislation 

to the extent that circumstances associated with regulatory balances change the regulatory balances are evaluated and adjusted if appropriate 

adverse legislative or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of our regulatory assets and liabilities and could materially adversely impact our financial statements details of the california utilities’ regulatory assets and liabilities and additional factors that management considers when assessing probabilities associated with regulatory balances are discussed in notes 1 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management judgments and estimates amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as well as current and noncurrent accruals involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities when we evaluate the anticipated resolution of income tax issues we consider 

▪ past resolutions of the same or similar issue 

▪ the status of any income tax examination in progress 

▪ positions taken by taxing authorities with other taxpayers with similar issues 

the likelihood of deferred income tax recovery is based on analyses of the deferred income tax assets and our expectation of future taxable income based on our strategic planning 

actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts because of   

▪ future impacts of various items including changes in tax laws regulations interpretations and rulings 

▪ our financial condition in future periods 

▪ the resolution of various income tax issues between us and taxing and regulatory authorities 

for an uncertain position to qualify for benefit recognition the position must have at least a morelikelythannot chance of being sustained based on the position’s technical merits upon challenge by the respective authorities the term morelikelythannot means a likelihood of more than 50 if we do not have a morelikelythannot position with respect to a tax position then we do not recognize any of the potential tax benefit associated with the position a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon the effective resolution of the tax position 

unrecognized tax benefits involve management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of the benefit being sustained the final resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in adjustments to recorded amounts and may affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we discuss details of our issues in this area and additional information related to accounting for income taxes including uncertainty in income taxes in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

derivatives and hedge accounting 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

we record derivative instruments for which we do not apply a scope exception at fair value on the balance sheet depending on the purpose for the contract and the applicability of hedge or regulatory accounting the changes in fair value of derivatives may be recorded in earnings on the balance sheet or in oci we also use the normal purchase or sale exception for certain derivative contracts whenever possible we use exchange quoted prices or other thirdparty pricing to estimate fair values if no such data is available we use internally developed models and other techniques the assumed collectability of derivative assets considers events specific to a given counterparty the counterparty’s credit worthiness and the tenor of the transaction 

the application of hedge accounting and normal purchase or sale accounting for certain derivatives is determined on a contractbycontract basis significant changes in assumptions in our cash flow hedges such as the amount andor timing of forecasted transactions could cause unrealized gains or losses marktomarket to be reclassified out of aoci to earnings which may 

materially impact our results of operations additionally changes in assumed physical delivery on contracts for which we elected normal purchase or sale accounting may result in “tainting” of the election which may 1 preclude us from making this election in future transactions and 2 impact sempra energy’s results of operations the impacts of derivatives and hedge accounting on the california utilities’ results of operations are typically not significant because regulatory accounting principles generally apply to their contracts we provide details of our derivative instruments and our fair value approaches in notes 11 and 12 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

to measure our pension and other postretirement obligations costs and liabilities we rely on several assumptions we consider current market conditions including interest rates in making these assumptions we review these assumptions annually and update when appropriate 

the critical assumptions used to develop the required estimates include the following key factors 

▪ discount rates 

▪ expected return on plan assets 

▪ health care cost trend rates 

▪ mortality rates 

▪ rate of compensation increases 

▪ termination and retirement rates 

▪ utilization of postretirement welfare benefits 

▪ payout elections lump sum or annuity 

▪ lump sum interest rates 

the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to 

▪ return on plan assets 

▪ changing market and economic conditions 

▪ higher or lower withdrawal rates 

▪ longer or shorter participant life spans 

▪ more or fewer lump sum versus annuity payout elections made by plan participants 

▪ higher or lower retirement rates 

these differences other than those related to the california utilities’ plans where rate recovery offsets the effects of the assumptions on earnings may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense we record for plans other than those at the california utilities the approximate annual effect on earnings of a 100 bps increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would be less than 1 million and the effect of a 100 bps increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would be less than 2 million we provide details of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

asset retirement obligations 

sempra energy sdge 

sdge’s legal aros related to the decommissioning of songs are estimated based on a sitespecific study performed no less than every three years the estimate of the obligations includes 

▪ estimated decommissioning costs including labor equipment material and other disposal costs 

▪ inflation adjustment applied to estimated cash flows 

▪ discount rate based on a creditadjusted riskfree rate 

▪ actual decommissioning costs progress to date and expected duration of decommissioning activities 

changes in the estimated decommissioning costs or in the assumptions and judgments made by management underlying these estimates could cause revisions to the estimated total cost associated with retiring the assets sdge’s nuclear decommissioning expenses are subject to rate recovery and therefore ratemaking accounting treatment is applied to sdge’s nuclear 

decommissioning activities sdge recognizes a regulatory asset or liability to the extent that its songs aro exceeds or is less than the amount collected from customers and the amount earned in sdge’s ndt 

we provide additional detail in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment testing of longlived assets 

sempra energy 

whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable we consider if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset if so we estimate the fair value of the asset to determine the extent to which carrying value exceeds fair value for such an estimate we may consider data from multiple valuation methods including data from market participants we exercise judgment to estimate the future cash flows and the useful life of a longlived asset and to determine our intent to use the asset our intent to use or dispose of a longlived asset is subject to reevaluation and can change over time 

events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable may include 

▪ significant decreases in the market price of an asset 

▪ a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use an asset or in its physical condition 

▪ a significant adverse change in legal or regulatory factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset 

▪ a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection of continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset and 

▪ a current expectation that morelikelythannot a longlived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

if an impairment test is required the fair value of a longlived asset can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions we discuss impairment of longlived assets in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment testing of goodwill 

sempra energy 

on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation we consider whether goodwill may be impaired for our annual goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test if we elect to perform the qualitative assessment we evaluate relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors changes in key personnel and the overall financial performance of the reporting unit if after assessing these qualitative factors we determine that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test if after performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test we determine that goodwill is impaired we record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 

when determining if goodwill is impaired the fair value of the reporting unit can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions as a result recognizing a goodwill impairment may or may not be required when we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we exercise judgment to develop estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to its carrying value our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant we consider observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments if available as well as an incomebased approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis a discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future revenues and expenses and may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the reporting unit critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include 

▪ consideration of market transactions 

▪ future cash flows 

▪ the appropriate riskadjusted discount rate 

▪ country risk 

▪ entity risk 

in 2020 we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units in mexico to which goodwill was allocated was substantially above their carrying values as of october 1 2020 our goodwill impairment testing date we discuss goodwill in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

carrying value of equity method investments 

sempra energy 

we generally account for investments under the equity method when we have significant influence over but do not have control of the investee 

we consider whether the fair value of each equity investment as a whole not the underlying net assets has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary to help evaluate whether a decline in fair value below carrying value has occurred and if the decline is other than temporary we may develop fair value estimates for the investment our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant in the absence of observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments we consider an incomebased approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis or with less weighting the replacement cost of the underlying net assets a discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future distributions from the investment or may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the entity and adjusted for our ownership share total for certain investments critical assumptions may include but are not limited to transportation rates for natural gas the appropriate riskadjusted discount rate and the availability and costs of natural gas and lng 

in addition for our indirect investment in oncor critical assumptions may also include the effects of ratemaking such as the results of regulator decisions on rates and recovery of regulated investments and costs the risk assumptions applied by other market participants to value the investments could vary significantly or the appropriate approaches could be weighted differently these differences could impact whether or not the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value and if so whether that condition is other than temporary this could result in an impairment charge and in cases where an impairment charge has been recorded additional loss or gain upon sale in the case of a sale transaction

new accounting standards 

we discuss the relevant pronouncements that have recently had or may have a significant effect on our financial statements andor disclosures in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of erosion of our cash flows earnings asset values or equity due to adverse changes in commodity market prices interest rates and foreign currency and inflation rates 

risk policies 

sempra energy has policies governing its market risk management and trading activities sempra energy and the california utilities maintain separate risk management committees organizations and processes for the california utilities and for all noncpuc regulated affiliates to provide oversight of these activities the committees consist of senior officers who establish policy oversee energy risk management activities and monitor the results of trading and other activities to help ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies these activities include but are not limited to monitoring of market positions that create credit liquidity and market risk the respective oversight organizations and committees are independent from energy procurement departments 

along with other tools we use var and liquidity metrics to measure our exposure to market risk associated with commodity portfolios var is an estimate of the potential loss on a position or portfolio of positions over a specified holding period based on normal market conditions and within a given statistical confidence interval we use a variancecovariance var model at a 95 confidence level a liquidity metric is intended to monitor the amount of financial resources needed for meeting potential margin calls as forward market prices move var and liquidity risk metrics are independently verified by the respective risk management oversight organizations 

the california utilities use power and natural gas derivatives to manage electric and natural gas price risk associated with servicing load requirements the use of power and natural gas derivatives is subject to certain limitations imposed by company policy and is in compliance with risk management and trading activity plans that have been filed with and approved by the cpuc we discuss revenue recognition in note 3 and additional marketrisk information regarding derivative instruments in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have exposure to changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency and inflation rates the following discussion of these primary marketrisk exposures as of december 31 2020 includes a discussion of how these exposures are managed 

commodity price risk 

market risk related to physical commodities is created by volatility in the prices and basis of certain commodities our various subsidiaries are exposed in varying degrees to commodity price risk primarily to prices in the natural gas and electricity markets our policy is to manage this risk within a framework that considers the specific markets and operating and regulatory environments of each subsidiary 

sempra mexico and sempra lng are generally exposed to commodity price risk indirectly through their lng natural gas pipelines and storage and powergenerating assets these segments may utilize commodity transactions in an effort to optimize these assets these transactions are typically priced based on market indices but may also include fixed price purchases and sales of commodities any residual exposure is monitored as described above a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in commodity prices would not have resulted in a material change in the fair value of our commoditybased derivatives for these segments at december 31 2020 or 2019 the impact of a change in energy commodity prices on our commoditybased derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled and does not typically include the generally offsetting impact of our underlying asset positions 

the california utilities’ marketrisk exposure is limited due to cpucauthorized rate recovery of the costs of commodity purchases interstate and intrastate transportation and storage activity however socalgas may at times be exposed to market risk as a result of incentive mechanisms that reward or penalize the utility for commodity costs below or above certain benchmarks for socalgas’ gcim if commodity prices were to rise too rapidly it is likely that volumes would decline this decline would increase the perunit fixed costs which could lead to further volume declines the california utilities manage their risk within the parameters of their market risk management framework as of and for the year ended december 31 2020 the total var of the california utilities’ natural gas and electric positions was not material and sdge’s power procurement activities were in compliance with the procurement plans filed with and approved by the cpuc 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily as a result of our having issued short and longterm debt subject to regulatory constraints we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to moderate our exposure to interest rate changes and to lower our overall cost of borrowing 

the table below shows the nominal amount of our debt 



1 after the effects of interest rate swaps before the effects of acquisitionrelated fair value adjustments and reductions for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs and excluding finance lease obligations 

an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis measures interest rate risk by calculating the estimated changes in earnings that would result from a hypothetical change in market interest rates earnings are affected by changes in interest rates on shortterm debt and variablerate longterm debt if weightedaverage interest rates on shortterm debt outstanding at december 31 2020 increased or decreased by 10 the change in earnings over the 12month period ending december 31 2021 would be negligible if interest rates increased or decreased by 10 on all variablerate longterm debt at december 31 2020 after considering the effects of interest rate swaps the change in earnings over the 12month period ending december 31 2021 would be negligible 

we provide further information about debt and interest rate swap transactions in notes 7 and 11 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we also are subject to the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the assets of our pension plans other postretirement benefit plans and sdge’s ndt however we expect the effects of these fluctuations as they relate to the california utilities to be recovered in future rates  

foreign currency and inflation rate risk 

we discuss our foreign currency and inflation exposures in “part ii – item 7 mda – impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations” 

the hypothetical effect for every 10 appreciation in the us dollar against the mexican peso in which we have operations and investments are as follows 



1 after the effects of foreign currency derivatives 

2 amount represents the impact to earnings for a change in the average exchange rate throughout the reporting period 

3 amount primarily represents the effects of currency exchange rate movement from december 31 2020 on monetary assets and liabilities and translation of nonus deferred income tax balances at our mexican subsidiaries 

4 amount represents the effects of currency exchange rate movement from december 31 2020 that would be recorded to oci at the end of the reporting period 

monetary assets and liabilities at our mexican subsidiaries and jvs that are denominated in us dollars may fluctuate significantly throughout the year these monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes based on a net monetary liability position of 44 billion including those related to our investments in jvs at december 31 2020 the hypothetical effect of a 10 increase in the mexican inflation rate is 

approximately 90 million lower earnings as a result of higher income tax expense for our consolidated subsidiaries as well as lower equity earnings for our jvs 

we completed the sales of our south american businesses in 2020 and are no longer exposed to changes in foreign currency and inflation rates in peru and chile

business strategy 

our mission is to be north america’s premier energy infrastructure company we are focused on generating stable predictable earnings and cash flows by investing in developing and operating electric and gas infrastructure with the goal of delivering safe and reliable energy to our customers and increasing shareholder value 

description of business by segment 

we operate our business through the following reportable segments 



sdge 

sdge is a regulated public utility that provides electric services to a population of approximately 37 million and natural gas services to approximately 34 million of that population covering a 4100 square mile service territory in southern california that encompasses san diego county and an adjacent portion of southern orange county 

electric utility operations 

electric transmission and distribution system service to sdge’s customers is supported by its electric transmission and distribution system which includes substations and overhead and underground lines these electric facilities are primarily in san diego imperial and orange counties of california and in arizona and nevada and consist of 2099 miles of transmission lines 23562 miles of distribution lines and 161 substations as of december 31 2019  periodically various areas of the service territory require expansion to accommodate customer growth reliability and safety 

sdge’s 500kv southwest powerlink transmission line which is shared with arizona public service company and imperial irrigation district extends from palo verde arizona to san diego california sdge’s share of the line is 1162 mw although it can be less under certain system conditions sdge’s sunrise powerlink is a 500kv transmission line constructed and operated by sdge with import capability of 1000 mw of power 

mexico’s baja california transmission system is connected to sdge’s system via two 230kv interconnections with combined capacity of up to 408 mw in the northtosouth direction and 800 mw in the southtonorth direction although it can be less under certain system conditions 

edison’s transmission system is connected to sdge’s system via five 230kv transmission lines 

electric resources to meet customer demand sdge supplies power from its own electric generation facilities and procures power on a longterm basis from other suppliers for resale through cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts or through purchases on a spot basis sdge does not earn any return on commodity sales volumes sdge’s supply as of december 31 2019 was as follows 



 

sdge is required to interconnect with and purchase power from qfs a class of generating facilities established by the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 at rates that do not exceed sdge’s avoided cost sdge’s qfs include cogeneration facilities which produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy such as heat or steam used for industrial commercial residential or institutional purposes charges under most of the contracts with qfs are based on what it would incrementally cost sdge to produce the power or procure it from other sources charges under the contracts with other suppliers are for firm and asgenerated energy and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity tolling contracts are purchasedpower contracts under which sdge provides natural gas for generation to the energy supplier the prices under these contracts include 125 mw at prices that are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated 

sdge procures natural gas under shortterm contracts for its owned generation facilities and for certain tolling contracts associated with purchasedpower arrangements purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

sdge is a participant in the western systems power pool which includes an electricpower and transmissionrate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities power agencies energy brokers and power marketers located throughout the us and canada participants can make power transactions on standardized terms including marketbased rates preapproved by the ferc participation in the western systems power pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk 

customers and demand sdge provides electric services through the generation transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes 



 

san diego’s mild climate and sdge’s robust energy efficiency programs contribute to lower consumption by our customers rooftop solar installations continue to reduce residential and commercial volumes sold by sdge as of december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  the residential and commercial rooftop solar capacity in sdge’s territory totaled 1233 mw 1023 mw and 836 mw respectively 

demand for electricity is dependent on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products consumer preference environmental regulations legislation renewable power generation the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs demandside management impact and distributed generation resources california’s energy policy supports increased electrification particularly electrification of vehicles which could result in significant increases in sales volumes in the coming years other external factors such as the price of purchased power the use of hydroelectric power the use of and further development of renewable energy resources and energy storage development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in the market price of electricity which may in turn impact demand demand for electricity is also impacted by seasonal weather patterns or “seasonality” tending to increase in the summer months to meet cooling load and in the winter months to meet heating load 

competition sdge faces competition to serve its customer load from the growth in distributed and local power generation including rooftop solar installations and battery storage and the corresponding decrease in demand for power from departing retail load from customers transferring to load serving entities other than sdge while sdge currently provides procurement service for the majority of its customer load customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than sdge through programs such as da and cca da is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours utility customers can also receive procurement through cca if the customer’s local jurisdiction city offers such a program several local political jurisdictions including the city of san diego and other municipalities are considering implementing or are implementing a cca which could result in sdge providing procurement service for less than half of its current customer load as early as 2021 when customers are served by another load serving entity sdge no longer procures electricity for this departing load and the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources could then be borne by sdge’s remaining bundled procurement customers to help achieve the goal of ratepayer indifference whether or not customers are served by da or cca the cpuc revised the power charge indifference adjustment framework by adopting several refinements which sdge implemented on january 1 2019 

natural gas utility operations

california utilities ’ natural gas utility operations 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

at december 31 2019 socalgas’ natural gas facilities include 3058 miles of transmission and storage pipelines 51073 miles of distribution pipelines 48315 miles of service pipelines and nine transmission compressor stations while sdge’s natural gas facilities consist of 168 miles of transmission pipelines 8961 miles of distribution pipelines 6582 miles of service pipelines and one compressor station 

socalgas purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the california utilities’ core customers socalgas purchases natural gas from various sources including from canada the us rockies and the southwestern regions of the us purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

to help ensure the delivery of natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights energy companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california 

natural gas storage 

socalgas owns four natural gas storage facilities with a combined working gas capacity of 137 bcf and over 200 injection withdrawal and observation wells that provide natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers socalgas’ and sdge’s core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas’ storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others including sdge for its noncore customer requirements natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for ensuring service reliability during peak demand periods including heating needs in the winter as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility has a storage capacity of 86 bcf and subject to the cpuc limitations described below represents 63 of socalgas’ natural gas storage capacity socalgas discovered a natural gas leak at one of its wells at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in october 2015 and permanently sealed the well in february 2016 socalgas was subsequently authorized to make limited withdrawals and injections of natural gas at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and as of july 2018 has been directed by the cpuc to maintain up to 34 bcf of working gas to help achieve reliability for the region at reasonable rates as determined by the cpuc in july 2019 to maintain system reliability and price stability the cpuc issued a protocol authorizing withdrawals of natural gas from the facility if gas 

supply is low in the region we discuss the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility leak in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “item 1a risk factors” and in “item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – socalgas” 

customers and demand 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers in its territory and sdge’s territory on a combined portfolio basis socalgas also offers natural gas transportation and storage services for others 



 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the california utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers a substantial portion of socalgas’ and sdge’s revenues are from core customers 

noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale and large commercial and industrial customers a portion of socalgas’ noncore customers are nonendusers socalgas’ nonendusers include wholesale customers consisting primarily of other utilities including sdge or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers 

noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements as the regulatory framework does not allow us to recover the cost of natural gas procured and delivered to noncore customers 

demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products consumer preference environmental regulations legislation california’s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs other external factors such as weather the price of electricity the use of hydroelectric power the use of and further development of renewable energy resources and energy storage development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas outside california and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price which may in turn impact demand 

one of the larger sources for natural gas demand is electric generation natural gasfired electric generation within southern california and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity growth in selfgeneration from rooftop solar the addition of more efficient gas technologies new energy efficiency initiatives and the extent that regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the california 

utilities’ respective service areas the demand for natural gas may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to climate change weather conditions and other impacts and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources given the significant quantity of natural gasfired generation natural gas is the dispatchable fuel of choice to help ensure electric reliability in our california service territories 

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and cash provided from operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry but subject to current regulatory limitations socalgas usually injects natural gas into storage during the summer months april through october which reduces cash provided by operating activities during this period and usually withdraws natural gas from storage during the winter months november through march which increases cash provided by operating activities when customer demand is higher 

sempra texas utilities 

sempra texas utilities is comprised of our equity method investments in oncor holdings which we acquired in march 2018 and sharyland holdings which we acquired in may 2019 we discuss these acquisitions in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements oncor holdings is a direct wholly owned entity of sempra texas intermediate holding company llc and at december 31 2019 owns an 8025 interest in oncor tti owns the remaining 1975 interest in oncor sempra energy owns an indirect 50 interest in sharyland holdings which owns a 100 interest in sharyland utilities 

certain ringfencing measures existing governance mechanisms and commitments which we describe in “item 1a risk factors” remain in effect following the merger and are intended to enhance oncor holdings’ and oncor’s separateness from their owners and to mitigate the risk that these entities would be negatively impacted by the bankruptcy of or other adverse financial developments affecting their owners sempra energy does not control oncor holdings or oncor and the ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to direct the management policies and operations of oncor holdings and oncor including the deployment or disposition of their assets declarations of dividends strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions these limitations include limited representation on the oncor holdings and oncor boards of directors as oncor holdings and oncor will continue to have a majority of independent directors thus oncor holdings and oncor will continue to be managed independently ie ringfenced as such we account for our 100 ownership interest in oncor holdings as an equity method investment see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our equity method investment in oncor holdings

at december 31 2019  our pipeline assets in mexico had design capacity of approximately 16501 mmcf per day of natural gas 204 mmcf per day of ethane gas 106000 barrels per day of ethane liquid 34000 barrels per day of lpg transmission and 80000 barrels of lpg storage 

lng regasification sempra mexico operates its eca lng regasification facility on land it owns in baja california mexico the eca lng regasification facility is capable of processing one bcf of natural gas per day and generates revenues from reservation and usage fees under terminal capacity agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with shell and gazprom expiring in 2028 that permit them together to use onehalf of the terminal’s capacity 

sempra lng has an agreement with sempra mexico to supply lng to the eca lng regasification facility in connection with sempra lng’s purchase agreement with tangguh psc sempra mexico purchases from sempra lng the lng delivered by tangguh psc to the eca lng regasification facility sempra mexico uses the natural gas produced from this lng and natural gas purchased in the market or through sempra lng’s marketing operations to supply a contract for the sale of natural gas to mexico’s national electric company the cfe at prices that are based on the socal border index if lng volumes received from tangguh psc are not sufficient to satisfy the commitment to the cfe sempra mexico may purchase natural gas from sempra lng’s marketing operations 

although the lng purchase agreement with tangguh psc specifies a number of cargoes to be delivered annually actual cargoes delivered have been significantly lower than the maximum specified under the agreement as a result sempra lng is contractually required to make monthly indemnity payments to sempra mexico for failure to deliver the contracted lng 

the lng regasification business is impacted by worldwide lng market prices high lng prices in markets outside the market in which sempra mexico’s eca lng regasification facility operates have resulted and could continue to result in lower than expected deliveries of lng cargoes to the eca lng regasification facility which could increase costs if sempra mexico is instead required to obtain lng in the open market at prevailing prices any inability to obtain expected lng cargoes could also impact sempra mexico’s ability to maintain the minimum level of lng required to keep the eca lng regasification facility in operation at the proper temperature prices in international lng markets through which sempra mexico must purchase natural gas to meet its contractual obligations to deliver natural gas to customers may also affect sempra mexico’s lng marketing operations which could have an adverse impact on its earnings but may be mitigated in part by the indemnity payments discussed above 

sempra mexico’s lng marketing operations sell natural gas to the cfe and other customers under supply agreements sempra mexico recognizes the revenue from the sale of natural gas upon transfer of the natural gas via pipelines to the customers at the agreed upon delivery points and in the case of the cfe at its thermoelectric power plants 

natural gas distribution sempra mexico’s natural gas distribution regulated utility ecogas operates in three separate distribution zones in mexico with approximately 2571 miles of pipeline and had approximately 132000 customer meters serving more than 425000 residential commercial and industrial consumers with sales volume of approximately eight mmcf per day in 2019  

ecogas relies on supply and transportation services from sempra lng and socalgas for the natural gas that it distributes to its customers if these affiliates fail to perform and ecogas is unable to obtain supplies of natural gas from alternate sources ecogas could lose customers and sales volume and could also be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility 

ecogas faces competition from other distributors of natural gas in each of its three distribution zones in mexicali chihuahua and la lagunadurango as other distributors of natural gas build or consider building natural gas distribution systems 

power business 

renewable power generation sempra mexico develops invests in and operates renewable energy generation facilities that have longterm ppas to sell the electricity they generate to its customers which are generally load serving entities as well as industrial and other customers load serving entities sell electric service to their endusers and wholesale customers upon receipt of our power delivery while industrial and other customers consume the electricity to run their facilities  at december 31 2019  sempra mexico had a fully contracted total nameplate capacity of 658 mw related to its fully operating wind and solar energy generation facilities 

natural gasfired generation tdm is a 625mw natural gasfired power plant located in mexicali baja california mexico that generates revenue from selling electricity andor resource adequacy to the california iso and to governmental public utility and wholesale power marketing entities it also has an ema with sempra lng for energy marketing scheduling and other related services to support its sales of generated power into the california electricity market under the ema tdm pays fees to sempra lng for these revenuegenerating services tdm also purchases fuel from sempra lng sempra mexico records revenue for the sale of power generated by tdm and records cost of sales for the purchases of natural gas and energy management services provided by sempra lng 

tdm competes daily with other generating plants that supply power into the california electricity market several of the wholesale markets supplied by merchant power plants have experienced significant pricing declines due to excess supply ienova 

manages commodity price risk at tdm by optimizing a mix of forward onpeak energy sales daily and hourly spot market sales of capacity energy and ancillary services and longerterm structured transactions and by avoiding short positions 

demand and competition 

the overall demand for natural gas distribution services increases during the winter months while the overall demand for electricity increases during the summer months 

ienova competes with mexican and foreign companies for certain new energy infrastructure projects in mexico some of its competitors including public or stateoperated companies and their affiliates may have better access to capital and greater financial and other resources which could give them a competitive advantage in bidding for such projects 

sempra mexico’s pipeline and storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated pipeline and storage facilities they compete primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets 

sempra mexico’s gas business competitors include among others 

generation from sempra mexico’s renewable energy assets is susceptible to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind inclement weather and hours of sunlight because sempra mexico sells power that it generates at its energía sierra juárez wind power generation facility into california sempra mexico’s future performance and the demand for renewable energy may be impacted by us state mandated requirements to deliver a portion of total energy load from renewable energy sources the rules governing these requirements in california are generally known as the rps program in california certification of a generation project by the cec as an err allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements if such purchase meets the provisions of sb x12 the rps program may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by sempra mexico particularly the demand from california’s utilities we expect to receive err certification for all our sempra mexico renewable facilities providing power to california as they become operational 

sempra mexico’s power business competitors include among others 

key noncash performance indicators 

key noncash performance indicators for sempra mexico include sales volume plant or facility availability capacity utilization and for its distribution operations customer count and consumption additional noncash performance indicators include obtaining and completing on time and on budget major projects compliance with reliability and regulatory standards and goals related to safety environmental considerations and regulatory performance 

sempra renewables 

sempra renewables developed owned and operated or held interests in wind energy generation facilities in the us that had longterm ppas to sell the electricity and the related green energy attributes they generated to its customers which were generally load serving entities 

in december 2018 sempra renewables completed the sale of its solar assets solar and battery storage development projects as well as its ownership interest in one wind facility to a subsidiary of con ed in april 2019 sempra renewables completed the sale of its remaining wind assets and investments to aep upon completion of the sales remaining nominal business activities at sempra renewables were subsumed into parent and other and the sempra renewables segment ceased to exist we provide additional information about these sales in notes 5 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sempra lng 

sempra lng develops projects for the export of lng holds an interest in a facility for the export of lng owns and operates natural gas pipelines and buys sells and transports natural gas through its marketing operations all within the us and mexico 

lng liquefaction 

cameron lng jv sempra lng and three project coowners total sa mitsui  co ltd and japan lng investment llc a company jointly owned by mitsubishi corporation and nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha hold interests in cameron lng jv for the development construction and operation of a threetrain natural gas liquefaction export facility at the existing cameron lng llc facility formerly used for regasification in hackberry louisiana a project developed and permitted by sempra lng sempra lng accounts for its 502 equity interest in cameron lng jv under the equity method 

in august 2019 commercial operation of train 1 commenced under cameron lng jv’s tolling agreements in february 2020 train 2 reached substantial completion and we expect to commence commercial operation in the coming days we believe it is reasonable to expect train 3 will commence commercial operation in the third quarter of 2020 

the three liquefaction trains are designed to have a nameplate capacity of 139 mtpa of lng with an expected export capability of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf per day cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of total sa mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd which subscribe the full nameplate capacity of three trains at the facility in addition cameron lng jv is working on the development of up to two additional trains we discuss cameron lng jv in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the construction of the first three trains and the potential for an additional two trains in “item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – sempra lng” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

demand and competition technological advances associated with shale gas and tight oil production have significantly reduced the need for north american lng import facilities and increased interest in liquefaction and export opportunities 

at current forward gas prices us gulf coast liquefaction is one of the most price competitive potential lng supply in the world resulting from many factors including 

 brownfield liquefaction is particularly price competitive due to existing lng tankage and berths 

global lng competition may limit us lng exports as international liquefaction projects attempt to match us gulf coast lng production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility it is expected that us lng exports will increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand and thereby facilitate development of a global commodity market for natural gas and lng 

our lng liquefaction business’ major domestic and international competitors currently include among others the following companies and their related lng affiliates 



additionally our cameron lng jv coowners and customers compete globally to market and sell lng to end users including gas and electric utilities located in lng importing countries around the world by providing liquefaction services cameron lng jv competes indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global lng market in addition to the us these competitors are located in the middle east southeast asia africa south america australia and europe 

midstream 

sempra lng has a 40mile natural gas pipeline in south louisiana the cameron interstate pipeline links the cameron lng facility in cameron parish louisiana to five interstate pipelines that connect to major markets in the midwest northeast and southeast us 

in february 2019 sempra lng completed the sale of its nonutility natural gas storage assets in the southeast us comprised of mississippi hub and bay gas to an affiliate of arclight capital partners upon completion of the sale sempra lng has no operational natural gas storage capacity 

demand and competition sempra lng’s pipeline business competes with other regulated and unregulated pipelines primarily on the basis of price in terms of transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets 

marketing operations 

sempra lng provides natural gas marketing trading and risk management services through the utilization and optimization of contracted lng natural gas supply and transportation as well as by optimizing its assets in the shortterm services market additionally it sells electricity under shortterm and longterm contracts and into the spot market and other competitive markets 

sempra lng’s marketing operations have an lng sale and purchase agreement with tangguh psc for the supply of the equivalent of 500 mmcf of natural gas per day from tangguh psc’s indonesian liquefaction facility with delivery to sempra mexico’s eca lng regasification facility at a price based on the socal border index for natural gas the lng purchase agreement allows tangguh psc to divert certain lng volumes to other global markets in exchange for cash differential payments to sempra lng sempra lng may also enter into shortterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified at the terminal for sale to other parties 

sempra lng is contracted to sell lng or if deliveries of lng cargoes are not sufficient natural gas to sempra mexico that allows sempra mexico to satisfy its obligation under supply agreements with the cfe tdm and other customers these revenues are adjusted for indemnity payments and profit sharing as discussed in “sempra mexico – gas business – lng regasification” above 

sempra lng also has an ema with sempra mexico to provide energy marketing scheduling and other related services to sempra mexico’s tdm power plant to support its sales of generated power into the california electricity market we discuss the ema in “sempra mexico – power business – natural gasfired generation” above 

key noncash performance indicators 

key noncash performance indicators at sempra lng include natural gas sales volume plant or facility availability and capacity utilization additional noncash performance indicators include goals related to safety environmental considerations and regulatory compliance and ontime and onbudget completion of development projects 

discontinued operations 

in january 2019 our board of directors approved a plan to sell our south american businesses which previously constituted our sempra south american utilities segment these businesses include our 100 interest in chilquinta energía in chile our 836 interest in luz del sur in peru and our interests in two energyservices companies tecnored and tecsur which provide electric construction and infrastructure services to chilquinta energía and luz del sur respectively as well as third parties these businesses and certain activities associated with these businesses are presented as discontinued operations as the sales represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results we do not plan to have significant continuing involvement in or be able to exercise significant influence on the operating or financial policies of these operations after they are sold 

chilquinta energía is an electricity distribution utility in chile with an approximate 9 share of the market at december 31 2019 serving a population of approximately 2 million in the regions of valparaíso and maule in central chile with a service area covering approximately 4100 square miles chilquinta energía also owns a 50 interest in eletrans which is engaged in the construction operation and maintenance of power transmission facilities in chile luz del sur is an electric distribution utility that serves a population of approximately 49 million in the southern zone of metropolitan lima peru with a service area covering approximately 1400 square miles luz del sur indirectly owns and operates santa teresa a 100mw hydroelectric power plant located in the cusco region of peru luz del sur delivers approximately 30 of all power used in peru 

chilquinta energía and luz del sur serve primarily regulated customers and recognize revenues based on tariffs that are set by the cne in chile and the osinergmin in peru that are based on an efficient model distribution company defined by those agencies 

and intended to cover the costs of the model company because the tariffs are not based on the costs of the specific utility they may not result in full cost recovery the tariffs are designed to provide for a passthrough to customers of transmission and energy charges recovery of reasonable operating and administrative costs incentives to reduce costs and make needed capital investments and a regulated rate of return on the distributor’s regulated asset base 

the cne’s review process for authorized distribution and transmission rates generally remains in effect for a period of four years the cne reviews rates for fouryear periods related to distribution and transmission separately on an alternating basis every two years the components of tariffs for luz del sur are reviewed and adjusted every four years 

in september 2019 we entered into an agreement to sell our equity interests in our peruvian businesses for an aggregate base purchase price of 359 billion subject to customary closing adjustments for working capital and changes in net indebtedness in october 2019 we entered into an agreement to sell our equity interests in our chilean businesses for an aggregate base purchase price of 223 billion subject to customary adjustments for working capital and changes in net indebtedness and other adjustments we expect the sales to close in the first half of 2020 

we provide further information about discontinued operations in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

regulation 

california state utility regulation 

the california utilities are principally regulated at the state level by the cpuc cec and carb  

the cpuc 

 the cpuc also oversees and regulates other products and services including solar and wind energy bioenergy alternative energy storage and other forms of renewable energy in addition the cpuc’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety violations 

the cec publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based on these forecasts the cec 

 the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the california utilities’ longterm investment decisions 

california requires certain of its electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver a significant percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the rps program 

ab 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 assigns responsibility to carb for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing ghg emissions the law requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a department within the california environmental protection agency an organization that reports directly to the governor’s office sempra lng and sempra mexico are also subject to the rules and regulations of carb

ratemaking mechanisms 

california utilities 

general rate case proceedings a cpuc grc proceeding is designed to set sufficient base rates to allow the california utilities to recover their reasonable forecasted operating costs and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investment the proceeding generally establishes the test year revenue requirements which authorizes how much the california utilities can collect from their customers and provides for attrition or annual increases in revenue requirements for each year following the test year in january 2020 the cpuc implemented a fouryear grc cycle for california ious the california utilities were directed to file a petition for modification to revise their 2019 grc to add two additional years resulting in a transitional fiveyear grc period 20192023 

cost of capital proceedings a cpuc cost of capital proceeding determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base which is a weightedaverage of the authorized returns on debt preferred stock and common equity referred to as return on equity or roe weighted on a basis consistent with the authorized capital structure the authorized return on rate base approved by the cpuc is the rate that the california utilities use to establish customer rates to recover costs to finance investments in cpucregulated electric distribution and generation as well as natural gas distribution transmission and storage assets 

a cost of capital proceeding also addresses the ccm which considers changes in interest rates based on the applicable 12month average moody’s utility bond index the ccm was reauthorized in the 2020 cost of capital proceeding and will continue through 2022 the ccm if triggered could automatically update the authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and update the authorized roe up or down by onehalf of the change in the applicable 12month average moody’s utility bond index 

we discuss the cost of capital in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

transmission rate cases sdge files separately with the ferc for its authorized roe on fercregulated electric transmission operations and assets the proceeding establishes a roe and a formulaic rate whereby rates are determined using 1 a base period of historical costs and a forecast of capital investments and 2 a trueup period similar to balancing account treatment that is designed to provide earnings equal to sdge’s actual cost of service including its authorized return on investment sdge makes annual information filings in december to update rates for the following calendar year sdge may also file for roe incentives that might apply under ferc rules sdge’s debttoequity ratio is set annually based on the actual ratio at the end of each year 

we discuss sdge’s to5 filing with the ferc in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

incentive mechanisms the cpuc applies performancebased measures and incentive mechanisms to all california ious under which the california utilities have earnings potential above authorized cpuc base operating margin if they achieve or exceed specific performance and operating goals generally for performancebased awards if performance is above or below specific benchmarks the utility is eligible for financial awards or subject to financial penalties 

sdge has incentive mechanisms associated with 

 socalgas has incentive mechanisms associated with 



other costbased recovery the cpuc and the ferc as it relates to sdge authorize the california utilities to collect revenue requirements for operating costs and capital related costs such as depreciation taxes and return on rate base from customers including 

 authorized costs are recovered as the commodity or service is delivered to the extent authorized amounts collected vary from actual costs the differences are generally recovered or refunded within a subsequent period based on the nature of the balancing account mechanism in general the revenue recognition criteria for balanced costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred because these costs are substantially recovered in rates through a balancing account mechanism changes in these costs are reflected as changes in revenues the cpuc and the ferc may impose various review procedures before authorizing recovery or refund for programs authorized including limitations on the total cost of the program revenue requirement limits or reviews of costs for reasonableness these procedures could result in disallowances of recovery from ratepayers 

sempra texas utilities 

rates and cost recovery oncor’s and sharyland utilities’ rates are regulated by the puct and certain cities and are subject to regulatory ratesetting processes and annual earnings oversight this regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings levels their rates are regulated based on an analysis of the respective utility’s costs and capital structure as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital however there is no assurance that the puct will judge all of the texas utilities’ costs to have been prudently incurred that the puct will not reduce the amount of invested capital included in the capital structure that the texas utilities’ rates are based upon that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce full recovery of the texas utilities’ costs or that their authorized roe will not be reduced 

the pura allows utilities to file under certain circumstances once per year and up to four rate adjustments between comprehensive base rate proceedings to recover distributionrelated investments on an interim basis the puct’s substantive rules also allow the texas utilities to update their transmission rates periodically on an interim basis to reflect changes in invested capital these “capital tracker” provisions encourage investment in the electric system to help ensure reliability and efficiency by allowing for timely recovery of and return on new investments 

capital structure and return on equity the puct approved rates in oncor’s and sharyland utilities’ 2017 rate reviews that took effect in november 2017 oncor’s puctauthorized roe is 98 and its authorized regulatory capital structure is 575 debt to 425 equity sharyland utilities’ puctauthorized roe is 97 and its authorized regulatory capital structure is 55 debt to 45 equity 

sempra mexico 

ecogas’ revenues are derived from service and distribution fees charged to its customers in pesos the price ecogas pays to purchase natural gas which is based on international price indices is passed through directly to its customers the service and distribution fees charged by ecogas are regulated by the cre which performs a review of rates every five years and monitors prices charged to endusers the tariffs operate under a returnonassetbase model in the annual tariff adjustment rates are adjusted to account for inflation or fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation indexing includes separate us and mexican cost components so that us costs can be included in the final distribution rates 

environmental matters 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “item 1a risk factors” you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions 

hazardous substances 

the cpuc’s hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allows california’s ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the california utilities to recover in rates 

90 of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the california utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates 

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets 

air and water quality 

the natural gas and electric industries are subject to increasingly stringent air quality and ghg standards such as those established by carb and scaqmd the california utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards we discuss ghg standards and credits further in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we discuss environmental matters concerning socalgas’ aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 1a risk factors”

we are a holding company and substantially all our assets are owned by our subsidiaries and in entities accounted for as equity method investments such as oncor holdings our ability to pay dividends and to meet our debt and other obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from our subsidiaries and equity method investments and in the short term our ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from our subsidiaries and equity method investments depend on their ability to successfully execute their business strategies and generate positive cash flows in addition the subsidiaries and other entities accounted for as equity method investments are separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us and could be precluded from paying any such dividends or making any such loans or distributions under certain circumstances including without limitation as a result of legislation regulation court order contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress the inability to access capital from our subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments as well from the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and prospects 

conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations 

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments in difficult credit market environments we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support new or ongoing business activities this could cause us to reduce nonsafety related capital expenditures and could increase our cost of servicing debt both of which could significantly reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability 

other factors can affect the availability and cost of credit for our businesses as well as the terms of equity and debt financing including 

 in addition over the past several years california ious have suffered from the potential catastrophic losses resulting from the impact of the multiple wildfires that spread through northern and southern california the california wildfires while the california wildfires occurred in counties outside of sdge’s electric service territory the uncertainty about the outcomes of these matters the possibility of catastrophic wildfires in the future and the failure of the state of california to adequately address the financial and operational risks facing california ious could materially and adversely impact sempra energy’s and the california utilities’ ability to access the capital markets at rates that we believe are commercially reasonable 

we are subject to additional risk due to uncertainty relating to the calculation of libor and its potential discontinuance 

certain of our financial and commercial agreements including variable rate indebtedness and credit facilities as well as interest rate derivatives incorporate libor as a benchmark for establishing certain rates libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform including discontinuation or replacement these reforms if implemented will cause this benchmark to perform differently than it has performed in the past or to be discontinued entirely or may have other consequences that cannot be predicted which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require us to seek to amend the terms of the relevant indebtedness or agreements which may require significant additional time effort andor money in the form of consent payments or otherwise and may not be possible on comparable terms or at all 

in an announcement on july 12 2018 the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom which regulates libor emphasized the need for market participants to transition away from libor before the end of 2021 it appears likely that libor will be discontinued or replaced with a different benchmark rate by 2021 a number of alternatives to libor have been proposed or are being developed but it is not clear which if any will be adopted at this time any of these alternatives may result in interest payments that are higher than expected or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such indebtedness for the interest periods if the applicable libor rate was available in its current form more generally any of the foregoing changes any other changes to libor as a result of national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform or other initiatives or any further uncertainty surrounding the implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on the cost of our variable rate indebtedness andor borrowings the effectiveness of our cash flow hedges and the cost of doing business under our commercial agreements that incorporate libor 

sempra energy has substantial investments in mexico and south america that expose us to foreign currency inflation legal tax economic geopolitical and management oversight risk 

we have significant foreign operations in mexico and south america our foreign operations pose complex management foreign currency inflation legal tax and economic risks certain of these risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic businesses all our international businesses are sensitive to geopolitical uncertainties and our nonutility international businesses are sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers all of which may be driven by changes in their environments and potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions and various regional and local economic and political factors risks and uncertainties as well as us foreign policy foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on our revenue costs or cash flows from our international operations which could materially adversely affect our financial performance our currency exposures are to the mexican peruvian and chilean currencies our mexican subsidiary ienova has us dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities that give rise to mexican currency exchange rate movements for mexican income tax purposes they also have significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are denominated in the mexican peso and must be translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes in addition monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes our primary objective when we attempt to reduce foreign currency risk is to preserve the economic value of our foreign investments and to reduce earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations we may attempt to hedge material crosscurrency transactions and earnings exposure through various means including financial instruments and shortterm investments we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries we are susceptible to volatility in oci caused by exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to our south american subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the us 

dollar we discuss our foreign currency exposure at our mexican subsidiaries in “item 7 mda” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

the current us administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements for example in november 2018 president trump signed the usmca which if approved by the legislatures of the us mexico and canada would replace nafta the us and mexico approved the usmca in january 2020 and june 2019 respectively but canada has yet to provide its approval the us administration has also implemented changes to us immigration policy and other policies that could impact trade including increasing tariffs such actions could result in changes in the mexican us and other markets that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects in addition if the us withdraws from nafta the mexican government could implement retaliatory actions such as the imposition of restrictions or import fees on mexican imports of natural gas from the us or imports and exports of electricity to and from the us any of these actions by either or both governments could adversely affect imports and exports between mexico and the us and negatively impact the us and mexican economies and the companies with whom we conduct business in mexico which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects 

we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our plan to divest certain of our assets and businesses as part of our capital rotation plan 

in 2019 we completed the divestiture of all our us solar and wind assets and certain nonutility natural gas storage assets in the southeast us additionally we entered into agreements to sell our south american businesses which we expect to close in the first half of 2020 subject to a number of closing conditions there can be no assurance that the pending sales will be completed if we do not successfully manage our current capital rotation plan any expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our results of operations and business could be materially adversely affected 

the tcja may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows the value of investments in our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

the tcja significantly changed the irc including taxation of us corporations by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate altering the expensing of capital expenditures limiting interest deductions adopting elements of a territorial tax system assessing a onetime deemed repatriation tax on cumulative undistributed earnings of usowned foreign entities at the time of enactment and introducing certain antibase erosion provisions while the us department of the treasury has issued final regulations for various sections of the irc certain aspects of the legislation are still subject to interpretation and will require implementing regulations by the us department of the treasury as well as state tax authorities which could lessen or increase adverse impacts in addition the regulatory treatment of the impacts of this legislation may be subject to the discretion of the ferc and state public utility commissions 

although it is unclear when or how capital markets the ferc or state public utility commissions may respond to the tcja we expect that certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies such as our funds from operationstodebt percentage will be negatively impacted as a result of an anticipated decrease in required income tax reimbursement payments to us from our domestic utility subsidiaries due to the decrease in the us statutory corporate income tax rate certain provisions of the tcja such as 100 expensing of certain capital expenditures and impacts on utilization of our nols may influence how we fund capital expenditures the timing of capital expenditures and possible redeployment of capital through sales or monetization of assets the timing of repatriation of foreign earnings and the use of equity financing to reduce our future use of debt although there can be no assurance that these strategies will reduce any potential adverse impact from these provisions of the tcja in addition although the deductibility of our interest cost is not limited for the current year future earnings may be affected based on our method of allocation across our businesses 

it is also uncertain whether additional avenues will evolve for companies to manage the adverse aspects of this legislation we believe that these strategies to the extent available and if successfully applied could lessen any such negative impacts on us although there can be no assurance in this regard 

we discuss the effects of the tcja further in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 mda – results of operations” 

our mandatory convertible preferred stock as well as any additional equity securities we may sell to raise funds may dilute the economic and voting interests of our common shareholders and may adversely affect the market value of our common stock 

in january 2018 we issued 17250000 shares of our series a preferred stock and in july 2018 we issued 5750000 shares of our series b preferred stock which are scheduled to convert into common stock on january 15 2021 and july 15 2021 respectively we may seek to reduce our indebtedness with the proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of common stock and possibly 

other equity securities which together with the conversion of the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock may materially dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our common stock and materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

our level of indebtedness may make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts or take other actions and we may need to divert cash to fund debt service payments or issue additional equity that may materially dilute the voting rights and economic interest of holders of our common stock 

our substantial debt service obligations due to our aggregate indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s results of operations cash flows financial condition and prospects by among other things 

 we are committed to maintaining our credit ratings at investment grade to maintain these credit ratings we may reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness with the proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities additional equity issuances may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our common stock there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities with terms that we consider acceptable or at all or that we will be able to reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness should we elect to do so to a level that allows us to maintain our investment grade credit ratings which may have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

certain credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place those ratings on negative outlook 

credit rating agencies routinely evaluate sempra energy and the california utilities and their ratings are based on a number of factors including the increased risk of wildfires in california perceived supportiveness of the regulatory environment affecting utility operations including delays and difficulties in obtaining recovery or the denial of recovery for wildfirerelated costs ability to generate cash flows level of indebtedness overall financial strength including credit metrics diversification beyond the regulated utility business in the case of sempra energy and the status of certain capital projects as well as other factors beyond our control such as the state of the economy and our industry generally downgrades and factors causing downgrades of one or both of the california utilities can have a material impact on sempra energy’s credit ratings downgrades as well as the factors causing such downgrades of sempra energy’s credit ratings could imply diminished credit support available to our subsidiaries accordingly downgrades of sempra energy’s credit ratings can also have a material impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries including the california utilities 

while the current moody’s sp and fitch collectively the rating agencies issuer credit ratings for sempra energy sdge and socalgas are investment grade there is no assurance that these credit ratings will not be downgraded 

for sempra energy the rating agencies have noted that the following events among other things could lead to negative ratings actions 

 for sdge the rating agencies have noted that the following events among other things could lead to negative ratings actions 



 for socalgas the rating agencies have noted that the following events among other things could lead to negative ratings actions 

 a downgrade of sempra energy’s or either of its california utilities’ credit ratings may materially and adversely affect the market prices of sempra energy’s equity and debt securities the interest rates at which borrowings are made and debt securities and commercial paper are issued and the various fees on credit facilities this could make it significantly more costly for sempra energy sdge socalgas and sempra energy’s other subsidiaries to borrow money to issue debt securities and to raise certain other types of capital andor complete additional financings such negative credit rating actions as well as the reasons for such actions could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition and the market price of and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities 

dividend requirements associated with our mandatory convertible preferred stock subject us to certain risks 

in january 2018 we issued 17250000 shares of our series a preferred stock and in july 2018 we issued 5750000 shares of our series b preferred stock any future payments of cash dividends and the amount of any cash dividends we pay on our series a preferred stock and our series b preferred stock will depend on among other things our financial condition capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries and equity method investees to distribute cash to us as well as other factors that our board of directors may consider relevant any failure to pay scheduled dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock when due would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our mandatory convertible preferred stock our common stock and our debt securities and would prohibit us under the terms of our mandatory convertible preferred stock from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of our common stock subject to limited exceptions until such time as we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the mandatory convertible preferred stock 

the terms of the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock generally provide that if dividends on any shares of the mandatory convertible preferred stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods whether or not for consecutive dividend periods the holders of shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock voting together as a single class will be entitled to elect a total of two additional members of our board of directors subject to certain terms and limitations described in the certificate of determination applicable to the mandatory convertible preferred stock 

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders 

while we strive to maintain constructive ongoing communications with all our shareholders and welcome their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all our shareholders activist shareholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management responding to proposals by activist shareholders would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees proxy solicitation expenses in the case of a proxy contest and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy 

any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control our ability to execute on our strategy or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from proposals by activist shareholders or a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability that may be exploited by our competitors andor other activist shareholders result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners any of which could have an adverse effect which may be material on our business and operating results 

actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in the trading prices of our common stock and our preferred stock based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

risks related to all sempra energy businesses 

severe weather conditions natural disasters pandemics accidents equipment failures explosions or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by severe weather conditions natural disasters such as fires earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes tsunamis floods mudslides accidents equipment failures explosions or acts of terrorism because we are in the business of using storing transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials as well as radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure as well as the risks to the surrounding communities are substantially greater than the risks such incidents may pose to a typical business the facilities and infrastructure that we own or in which we have interests that may be subject to such incidents include but are not limited to 

 such incidents could result in severe business disruptions prolonged power outages property damage injuries or loss of life significant decreases in revenues and earnings andor significant additional costs to us such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners supply chains and transportation which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide natural gas and electricity to our customers other global incidents could have similar effects to the extent they reach and impact the territories in which we operate the customers we serve or the employees who operate our businesses for example the coronavirus outbreak currently affecting china and elsewhere has resulted in travel restrictions and impacts on the global economy that could affect our operations in a manner that is not presently possible to predict any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires natural gas natural gas odorant propane or ethane leaks releases of other ghg radioactive releases explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties personal injuries health impacts or fatalities or present a nuisance to impacted communities any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us in some cases we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault such as in cases where the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies we discuss how the application of this doctrine in california imposes strict liability on a utility whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire meaning the utility may be found liable regardless of fault below under “risks related to the california utilities – the wildfire legislation may not adequately protect sdge from liability from catastrophic wildfires in its service territory” insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become prohibitively expensive may be disputed by the insurers or may become unavailable for certain of these risks or at sufficient levels and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to the existence of limitations exclusions high deductibles failure to comply with procedural requirements and other factors which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects as well as the trading prices of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and tax requirements and may be materially adversely affected by these regulations or requirements or changes thereto 

the electric power and natural gas industries are subject to complex government regulations that from time to time undergo significant changes on the federal state and local levels the failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to significant fines and penalties and result in the temporary or permanent shutdown of certain facilities and operations in addition changes to these regulations or how these regulations are interpreted may adversely affect how we conduct our business and may subject us to higher compliance costs 

our businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements and the regulations laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs any new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations in the us and other countries in which we operate could materially adversely affect our tax expense andor tax balances and changes in tax policies could materially adversely impact our business changes in regulations laws and tariffs and how they are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the california utilities and other sempra energy businesses these rules are commonly referred to as “affiliate rules” which primarily impact commodity and commodityrelated transactions these businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or to their interpretations or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell natural gas or electricity to or to trade with the california utilities and with each other affiliate rules also restrict these businesses from entering into any such transactions with the california utilities any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the lng facilities natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or other operations of our subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses require numerous permits licenses agreements and other approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies and any failure to obtain or maintain them could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

the acquisition construction expansion ownership maintenance andor operation of electric generation transmission and distribution infrastructure natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels lng and lpg facilities terminals and storage and other projects require numerous permits licenses rightsofway franchise agreements certificates and other approvals from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including approvals and renewals of rightsofway over indigenous tribal land these permits licenses rightsofway franchise agreements certificates and other approvals may be modified rescinded or fail to be extended by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses or as a result of litigation for example socalgas’ franchise agreements with the city of los angeles and los angeles county expire in december 2020 and june 2023 respectively sdge’s franchise agreement with the city of san diego is due to expire in january 2021 successfully maintaining or renewing any or all of these approvals could result in higher costs furthermore our permits may require compliance by our underlying customers failure by our customers to comply with permit requirements could result in our permits being modified suspended or rescinded in the event one or more of these approvals were to expire or otherwise terminate we may be required to remove the associated assets from service construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area or both and our ability to recover higher costs associated with these events cannot be assured 

successfully coordinating and completing expansion and construction projects requires good execution from our employees and contractors cooperation of third parties and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay we may invest a significant amount of money in a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if there is a delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes if we fail to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be precluded from constructing or operating facilities or if management decides not to proceed with the project we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects further accidents beyond our control may cause us to violate the terms of conditional use permits causing delays in projects any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain necessary permits licenses certificates and other approvals could cause our operations and prospects to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows andor results of operations 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection including air quality water quality and usage wastewater discharge solid waste management hazardous waste disposal and remediation conservation of natural resources wetlands and wildlife renewable energy resources climate change and ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees our regulated utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs for projects are not recoverable in rates in addition we may be ultimately responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our projects and properties in each case regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown which exposes us to risks arising from 

contamination at our former or existing facilities or with respect to offsite waste disposal sites that have been used in our operations in the case of our california and other regulated utilities some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates our facilities including those in our jvs are subject to laws and regulations that have been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to power generation facilities failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines andor significant curtailments of our operations which could materially adversely affect our cash flows andor results of operations 

increasing international national regional and statelevel environmental concerns as well as related new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as potential state national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations for example sb 100 requires each california utility including sdge to procure 50 of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2026 and 60 by 2030 sb 100 also creates the policy of meeting all the state of california’s retail electricity supply with a mix of rpseligible and zerocarbon resources by 2045 for a total of 100 clean energy the law also includes stipulations that this policy not increase carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid and not allow resource shuffling and requires that the cpuc cec carb and other state agencies incorporate this into all relevant planning our california utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates even if recoverable the effects of existing and proposed ghg emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth and may have a material adverse effect on the california utilities’ cash flows sdge may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

in addition existing and future laws orders and regulations regarding mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates methane or other emissions could result in requirements for additional monitoring pollution monitoring and control equipment safety practices or emission fees taxes or penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows 

our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation against us 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and arbitration proceedings including in connection with the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility natural gas leak we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and proceedings and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings we discuss pending proceedings in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the uncertainties inherent in lawsuits arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part by insurance or in rates from our customers which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices in addition for those contract positions that are hedged our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the extent of the coverage to these exposures varies over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition certain of the contracts we may use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts in certain cases these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged 

risk management procedures may not prevent or mitigate losses 

although we have in place risk management and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended by our businesses or may not work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of 

these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent or mitigate losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees 

several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a companybycompany basis any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

in addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face eg malware malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information we face evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information smart grid infrastructure and natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure 

existing business technologies and the deployment of new business technologies represent a largescale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer information as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure additionally we often rely on third party vendors to deploy new business technologies and maintain modify and update our systems including systems that manage sensitive information these third parties could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures to protect our systems and information while our computer systems have been and will continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malware unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks to date we have not detected a material breach of cybersecurity addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across sempra energy’s businesses including investing in risk management and information security measures to protect our systems the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated cyber risks despite our best efforts our businesses may not be fully insulated from cyberattacks and system disruptions an attack on our information systems the integrity of the energy grid our pipelines and distribution and storage infrastructure or one of our facilities or unauthorized access to confidential customer information could result in energy delivery service failures financial and reputational loss violations of privacy laws customer dissatisfaction and litigation any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

in the ordinary course of business sempra energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees customer energy usage and other information the theft damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws subject us to claims from third parties require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations and harm our reputation sempra energy maintains cyber liability insurance but this insurance is limited in scope and subject to exceptions conditions and coverage limitations and may not cover any or even a substantial portion of the costs associated with the consequences of personal confidential or proprietary information being compromised and there is no guarantee that the insurance that we do maintain will continue to be available at rates that we believe are commercially reasonable 

further as seen with recent cyberattacks around the world the goal of a cyberattack may be primarily to inflict largescale harm on a company and the places where it operates any such cyberattack could cause widespread disruptions to our operating financial and administrative systems including the destruction of critical information and programming that could materially adversely affect our business operations and the integrity of the power grid negatively impact our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements or comply with ongoing disclosure obligations or other regulatory requirements andor release confidential information about our company and our customers employees and other constituents any of which could lead to sanctions or negatively affect the general perception of our business in the financial markets and which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects  

risks related to the california utilities 

the california utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may materially adversely affect us 

the cpuc regulates the california utilities’ rates except sdge’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates among other matters the california utilities’ 



 the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility operations safety standards and practices compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows socalgas and sdge may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines and storage and for sdge electric operations under regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety and citation programs concerning both gas and electric safety which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the california utilities’ rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in notes 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the cpuc periodically approves the california utilities’ rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs including income taxes and an authorized rate of return on investments as well as settlements while incorporating a riskbased decisionmaking framework delays by the cpuc on decisions authorizing recovery or denying recovery afterthefact reasonableness reviews with unclear standards authorizations for less than full recovery or rejection of their settlements may adversely affect the working capital cash flows and financial condition of each of the california utilities if the california utilities receive an adverse cpuc decision andor actual capital expenditures andor operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the cpuc our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected 

socalgas and sdge have significantly invested and continue to invest in major programs such as psep under an approved cpuc framework however the total investment to date is substantially subject to cpuc reasonableness review although we believe these costs have been prudently incurred the standards applied by the cpuc could result in the disallowance of a portion of these incurred costs which could materially and adversely affect sdge’s socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in california there are laws that establish rules governing among other subjects communications between cpuc officials cpuc staff and regulated utilities rules and processes around ex parte communications could result in delayed decisions increased investigations enforcement actions and penalties in addition the cpuc or other parties may initiate investigations of past communications between public utilities and cpuc officials and staff that could result in reopening completed proceedings for reconsideration 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets and other similar matters involving sdge 

the california utilities may be materially adversely affected by new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies in addition existing legislation or regulations may be revised or reinterpreted new revised or reinterpreted legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how the california utilities operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses 

our california utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as turn utility consumers’ action network sierra club and other stakeholder advocacy and activist groups to the extent that these groups are successful in influencing our california utilities’ operations this could have a material adverse effect on the california utilities’ businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects 

the wildfire legislation may not adequately protect sdge from liability from catastrophic wildfires in its service territory and we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or at all 

in july 2019 the governor of california signed the wildfire legislation into law which addresses certain important issues related to catastrophic wildfires in the state of california and their impact on electric ious investorowned gas distribution utilities such as socalgas are not covered by this legislation the issues addressed include wildfire mitigation cost recovery standards and requirements a wildfire fund a cap on liability and the establishment of a wildfire safety board the wildfire legislation did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation which imposes strict liability on a utility meaning that the utility may be found liable regardless of fault whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire rather the wildfire legislation established a revised legal standard for the recovery of wildfire costs revised prudent manager standard and established the wildfire fund designed to provide liquidity to participating california electric ious to pay iou wildfirerelated claims in the event that the 

governmental agency responsible for determining causation determines the applicable iou’s equipment caused the ignition of a wildfire primary insurance coverage is exceeded and certain other conditions are satisfied we are unable to predict whether the wildfire legislation will be effectively implemented and its impact on sdge’s ability to recover certain costs and expenses in cases where sdge’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation 

we have experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the california utilities’ operations particularly sdge’s operations in addition the insurance that has been obtained for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses that we may incur or may not be available in sufficient amounts to meet the primary insurance required by the wildfire legislation of 1 billion uninsured losses may not be recoverable in customer rates increases in the cost of insurance may be challenged when we seek cost recovery california courts have invoked the doctrine of inverse condemnation for wildfire damages whereby if a utility company’s equipment such as its electric distribution and transmission lines are determined to be a cause of one or more fires the utility could be held strictly liable for damages as well as attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent as a result of the strict liability standard applied to wildfires recent losses recorded by insurance companies and the risk of an increase in the number and size of wildfires insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be available or may be available only at rates that are prohibitively expensive in addition even if insurance for wildfire liabilities is available it may not be available in such amounts as are necessary to cover potential losses a loss which is neither fully insured nor can be recovered in customer rates such as the cpuc decision denying sdge’s recovery of costs for the 2007 wildfires could materially adversely affect sempra energy’s and one or both of the california utilities’ financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are unable to predict whether we would be allowed to recover in rates or from the wildfire fund the costs of any uninsured losses 

we monitor weather conditions continuously to help ensure the safe operation of our facilities during the periods of elevated wildfire ignition risk should conditions become extreme we may deenergize certain of our facilities as a last resort to minimize this safety risk to the public such “public safety power shutoffs” could be subject to increased scrutiny by regulators and law makers and may lead to increased risk of penalties and liability for damages there can be no assurance that such costs would be recoverable in rates 

extreme weather conditions changing weather patterns and population growth in areas of the state of california in environments with historically higher risk of wildfires could materially affect the california utilities’ and sempra energy’s business financial condition results of operations liquidity and cash flows 

frequent and more severe drought conditions unseasonably warm temperatures very low humidity and stronger winds have increased the degree and prevalence of wildfires in california including in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories which could place third party property and our electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy and reduce the availability of hydroelectric generators this could result in temporary power shortages in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories andor catastrophic destruction of thirdparty property for which sdge or socalgas may be liable and unable to recover from ratepayers or may have inadequate insurance coverage the wildfire legislation signed into law in july 2019 includes a number of measures primarily intended to address certain important issues related to catastrophic wildfires in the state of california including wildfire mitigation cost recovery standards and requirements a wildfire fund a cap on liability and the establishment of a wildfire safety board however in the event of a significant wildfire involving sdge equipment the standards prescribed by the wildfire legislation may not be applied by the state of california consistently or the wildfire fund could be completely exhausted due to fires in other california ious’ service territories by fires in sdge’s service territory or by a combination thereof which could impact our ability to timely access capital necessary to address in whole or in part inverse condemnation and other liabilities in addition the state of california has been subject to housing shortages such that certain local land use policies and forestry management practices have been relaxed in certain cases to allow for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in high risk fire areas that may not have the infrastructure or contingency plans necessary to address such risk 

severe rainstorms and associated high winds in our service territories as well as flooding and mudslides where vegetation has been destroyed as result of human modification or wildfires could damage our electric and natural gas infrastructure resulting in increased expenses including higher maintenance and repair costs and interruptions in natural gas and electricity delivery services as a result these events can have significant financial consequences including regulatory penalties and disallowances if the california utilities encounter difficulties in restoring service to their customers on a timely basis further the cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process any such events could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

events or conditions caused by climate change including risk of wildfires severe weather conditions and flooding caused by rising sea levels could have a greater impact on the california utilities’ operations than the california utilities currently 

anticipate if the cpuc fails to adjust the california utilities’ rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change or if a major fire is determined to be caused by our equipment sempra energy’s and the california utilities’ business financial condition results of operations liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected 

the california utilities are subject to risks arising from the operation maintenance and upgrades of their natural gas and electricity infrastructure and information technology systems which if they materialize could adversely affect sempra energy’s and the california utilities’ financial results 

the california utilities own and operate electric transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas transmission distribution and storage facilities which are in many cases interconnected andor managed by information technology systems the california utilities undertake substantial capital investment projects to construct replace improve and upgrade these facilities and systems but while these capital investment projects are in process and even once completed there is a risk of among other things potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure and information technology systems human error in operations or maintenance shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment material and labor operational restrictions resulting from environmental requirements and governmental interventions and performance below expected levels in addition as discussed above weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation transmission and distribution delivery systems because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties 

additional risks associated with the ability of the california utilities to safely and reliably operate maintain improve and upgrade their facilities and systems many of which are beyond the california utilities’ control include 

 the occurrence of any of these events could affect demand for natural gas or electricity cause unplanned outages damage the california utilities’ assets andor operations damage the assets andor operations of third parties on which the california utilities rely damage property owned by customers or others and cause personal injury or death as a result the california utilities could incur costs to purchase replacement power to repair assets and restore service and to compensate third parties any such events could materially adversely affect sempra energy’s and one or both of the california utilities’ financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

socalgas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs expenses and other liabilities related to the natural gas leak at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and mitigating local community environmental impacts from the leak some or a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance and socalgas also may incur significant liabilities for damages restitution fines penalties and other costs and emissions mitigation activities as a result of this incident some or a significant portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance or may exceed insurance coverage 

in october 2015 socalgas discovered a leak at one of its injectionandwithdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in los angeles county as described in “civil and criminal litigation” and “regulatory proceedings” in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements numerous lawsuits investigations and regulatory proceedings have been initiated in response to the leak resulting in significant costs 

civil and criminal litigation 

as of february 21 2020 393 lawsuits including approximately 36000 plaintiffs are pending against socalgas related to the leak some of which have also named sempra energy all these cases other than a matter brought by the los angeles county district attorney and the federal securities class action are coordinated before a single court in the la superior court for pretrial management the court has scheduled an initial trial for june 24 2020 for a small number of randomly selected individual plaintiffs for a more detailed description of the civil and criminal lawsuits brought against us see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

five shareholder derivative actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties have been filed against certain officers and directors of sempra energy andor socalgas four of which were joined in a consolidated shareholder derivative complaint in august 2017 these complaints were dismissed and shareholders filed an amended complaint in february 2020 a federal securities class action alleging violation of the federal securities laws also was filed against sempra energy and certain of its officers which is on appeal following dismissal by the court 

a misdemeanor criminal complaint was filed by the la county district attorney’s office as to which socalgas entered a settlement that was approved by the la superior court but is subject to appeal by certain residents additional litigation including by public entities and criminal complaints may be filed against us in the future related to the leak or our responses thereto 

the costs of defending against or resolving the civil and criminal lawsuits and any compensatory statutory or punitive damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs if awarded or imposed as well as the costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released could be significant if any of these costs are not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits if there are significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible such amounts could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

governmental investigations orders and additional regulation 

in january 2016 calgem and the cpuc selected blade to conduct under their supervision an independent analysis of the technical root cause of the leak to be funded by socalgas the root cause analysis was released in may 2019 and concluded that socalgas had complied with gas storage regulations in existence at the time of the leak and that the related compliance activities conducted prior to the leak did not find indications of a casing integrity issue but that there were also measures though not required by the gas storage regulations at the time that could have been taken to aid in the early identification of corrosion and that in the opinion of blade would have prevented or mitigated the leak in addition calgem is investigating the leak 

in june 2019 the cpuc opened an oii to consider penalties against socalgas for the leak the first phase will consider whether socalgas violated public utilities code section 451 or other laws cpuc orders or decisions rules or requirements whether socalgas engaged in unreasonable andor imprudent practices with respect to its operation and maintenance of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility or its related recordkeeping practices whether socalgas cooperated sufficiently with the safety enforcement division sed and blade during the preformal investigation and whether any of the mitigation proposed by blade should be implemented to the extent not already done in november 2019 sed based largely on the blade report alleged a total of 330 violations asserting that socalgas violated california public utilities code section 451 and failed to cooperate in the investigation and to keep proper records hearings in the first phase of the oii are scheduled to begin in april 2020 the second phase will consider whether socalgas should be sanctioned for the leak and what penalties if any should be imposed for any violations proven in the first phase as well as determine the amounts of various costs incurred by socalgas and other parties in connection with the leak and the ratemaking treatment or other disposition of such costs 

higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas as a result of new laws orders rules and regulations arising out of this incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates in addition any of these investigations could result in findings of violations of laws orders rules or regulations as well as fines sanctions and other penalties socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any such new laws orders rules and regulations or by these investigations 

natural gas storage operations and reliability 

natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods including peak electric generation needs in the summer and heating needs in the winter the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility with a storage capacity of 86 bcf representing 63 of socalgas’ natural gas storage capacity is the largest socalgas storage facility and an important element of socalgas’ delivery system as a result of the leak socalgas suspended injection of natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility beginning in october 2015 and following a comprehensive safety review and authorization by calgem and the cpuc’s executive director resumed limited injection operations in july 2017 i n february 2017 the cpuc opened a proceeding pursuant to sb 380 to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region 

if the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value it could result in an impairment of the facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs andor additional capital expenditures and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized at december 31 

2019 the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of 769 million  any significant impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations for the period in which it is recorded higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas may not be recoverable in customer rates and socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

insurance and estimated costs 

excluding directors’ and officers’ liability insurance we have at least four kinds of insurance policies that together we estimate provide between 12 billion to 14 billion in insurance coverage depending on the nature of the claims at december 31 2019 socalgas’ estimate of costs related to the leak of 1116 million includes 1086 million of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance this estimate may rise significantly as more information becomes available costs not included in the 1116 million cost estimate could be material we have received insurance payments for many of our costs including temporary relocation and associated processing costs controlofwell expenses costs of the governmentordered response to the leak legal costs and lost gas 

if any costs are not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits if there are significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible such amounts could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

as described in “civil and criminal litigation” above the actions against us seek compensatory statutory and punitive damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs which except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions are not included in the 1116 million cost estimate as it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the amount of damages restitution or civil administrative or criminal fines sanctions penalties or other costs this cost estimate also does not include future legal costs to defend litigation and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate furthermore the cost estimate does not include certain other costs incurred by sempra energy through december 31 2019 associated with defending shareholder derivative lawsuits costs not included in the 1116 million cost estimate could be material there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining insurance coverage for these costs under the applicable policies and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining coverage or these costs exceed the amount of our coverage such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

additional information 

we discuss aliso canyon natural gas storage facility matters further in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

natural gas pipeline safety assessments may not be fully or adequately recovered in rates 

the california utilities test or replace natural gas transmission pipelines located in populated areas that either have not been pressure tested or lack sufficient documentation of a pressure test to enhance existing valve infrastructure and to retrofit pipelines to allow for the use of inline inspection technology referred to as socalgas’ and sdge’s psep 

the cpuc established criteria to determine the amounts related to psep that may be recovered from ratepayers and the processes for recovery of such amounts including providing that such costs are subject to a reasonableness review in the future certain psep costs may be subject to recovery as determined by separate regulatory filings with the cpuc including grc filings pseprelated proceedings before the cpuc regarding the california utilities’ reasonableness review and cost recovery requests are often challenged by intervening parties in the future consumer advocacy groups may similarly challenge the california utilities’ petitions for recovery and recommend disallowances in whole or in part with respect to applications to recover psep costs including through grc filings 

from 2011 through 2019 socalgas and sdge have invested and have or plan to seek recovery for approximately 18 billion and 445 million respectively in psep with substantial additional expenditures planned as of december 31 2019 socalgas and sdge have received approval for recovery of 13 billion and 15 million respectively on january 30 2020 socalgas and sdge reached a settlement with certain intervenors in the 2018 reasonableness review proceeding which would resolve all but one issue regarding the period of recovery the settlement is subject to cpuc approval beginning in 2019 the majority of investments in psep projects are being recovered in base rates as approved in the 2019 grc fd if the cpuc denies or significantly delays rate recovery for psep and other gas pipeline safety costs incurred by socalgas and sdge it could materially adversely affect the respective company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the california utilities are subject to increasingly stringent safety standards and the potential for significant penalties if regulators deem either sdge or socalgas to be out of compliance 

sb 291 requires the cpuc to develop and maintain a safety enforcement program that includes procedures for monitoring data tracking and analysis and investigations and delegates citation authority to cpuc staff personnel under the direction of the cpuc executive director under the enforcement program the maximum penalty is 50000 per offense each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense cpuc staff has authority to issue citations up to an administrative limit of 8 million per citation under either program and such citations may be appealed to the cpuc although citations issued under these enforcement programs do include an administrative limit penalties issued by the cpuc can exceed this limit having exceeded 15 billion in one instance for an unrelated third party 

if the cpuc or its staff determine that either of sdge’s or socalgas’ operations and practices are not in compliance with applicable safety standards and operating procedures the corrective or mitigation actions required to become in conformance if not sufficiently funded in customer rates and any penalties imposed could materially adversely affect that company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the failure by the cpuc to continue reforms of sdge’s rate structure including the implementation of charges independent of consumption volume and reforms to reduce nem rate subsidies could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

the current electric residential rate structure in california is primarily based on consumption volume which places a higher rate burden on customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers 

the nem program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of onsite renewable generation primarily solar installations under nem qualifying customergenerators receive a full retail rate for the energy they generate that is fed to the utility’s power grid this occurs during times when the customer’s generation exceeds their own energy usage wholesale rates apply only if a customer’s annual generation exceeds their annual consumption under this structure nem customers do not pay their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system subject to certain limitations while they still receive electricity from the system when their selfgeneration is inadequate to meet their electricity needs the unpaid nem costs are subsidized by customers not participating in nem accordingly as higher electricuse residential customers switch to nem and selfgenerate energy the burden on the remaining customers increases which in turn encourages more selfgeneration further increasing rate pressure on existing customers 

in july 2015 the cpuc adopted a decision that provided a framework for rates that we believe are more transparent fair and sustainable the framework provides for a minimum monthly bill fewer rate tiers and a gradual reduction in the differences between the tiered rates and directs the utilities to pursue expanded timeofuse rates the framework will be fully implemented in 2020 and should result in relief for higheruse customers and a rate structure that better aligns rates with actual costs to serve customers the decision also establishes a process for utilities to seek implementation of a fixed charge for residential customers in 2020 subject to certain conditions we believe the establishment of a charge independent of consumption volume for residential customers may become more critical to help ensure rates are fair for all customers including the nem issue discussed above distributed energy resources and energy efficiency initiatives could generally reduce delivered volumes increasing the importance of a fixed charge in addition the continuing increase of solar installations and other forms of selfgeneration adversely impacts the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system and could increase fixed costs 

if the cpuc fails to continue to reform sdge’s rate structure to maintain reasonable costbased electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system such failure could lead to the disallowance of recovery for our costs including power procurement costs operating or capital costs or the imposition of fines and penalties any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

the electricity industry is undergoing significant change including increased deployment of distributed energy resources technological advancements and political and regulatory developments 

electric utilities in california are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources such as solar energy storage energy efficiency and demand response technologies this growth will eventually require modernization of the electric distribution grid to among other things accommodate increasing twoway flows of electricity and increase the grid’s capacity to interconnect distributed energy resources the cpuc is conducting proceedings to evaluate various demonstration projects and pilots implement changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources and if feasible what if any compensation would be appropriate and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator these proceedings may result in new regulations policies andor 

operational changes that could materially adversely affect sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

sdge provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a longterm basis while sdge currently provides such procurement service for most of its customer load customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than sdge through programs such as da and cca da is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours utility customers could also receive procurement through cca if the customer’s local jurisdiction city offers such a program several local political jurisdictions including the city and county of san diego and other municipalities are considering implementing or are implementing a cca which could result in sdge providing procurement service for less than half of its current customer load as early as 2021 when customers are served by another load serving entity sdge no longer procures electricity for this departing load and the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources could then be borne by sdge’s remaining bundled procurement customers state law requires that customers opting to have a cca procure their electricity must absorb the cost of abovemarket electricity procurement commitments already made by sdge on their behalf if adequate mechanisms are not implemented to ensure compliance with state law remaining bundled customers of sdge could potentially experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of cca customers prior to their departure which may not be fully recoverable in rates by sdge if legislative regulatory or legal action were taken to prevent the timely recovery of these procurement costs or if mechanisms are not in place to ensure compliance with state law the unrecovered costs could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

natural gas and natural gas storage has increasingly been the subject of political and public scrutiny including a desire by some to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source 

california legislators and stakeholder advocacy and activist groups have expressed a desire to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source by advocating increased use of renewable energy and electrification in lieu of the use of natural gas the cpuc initiated an oir to update gas reliability standards determine the regulatory changes necessary to improve coordination between natural gas utilities and natural gasfired electric generators and implement a longterm planning strategy to manage the state’s transition away from natural gasfueled technologies to meet california’s decarbonization goals the oir will be conducted in three phases the first phase will address reliability standards the second phase will address coordination between natural gas utilities and natural gasfired electric generators the third phase will implement a longterm planning strategy comments on the scope of the new oir were due on february 26 2020 a substantial reduction or the elimination of natural gas as an energy source in california could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility that is being decommissioned 

sdge has a 20 ownership interest in songs formerly a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california that is in the process of being decommissioned by edison the majority owner of songs sdge and each of the other owners is responsible for financing its share of expenses and capital expenditures including decommissioning activities although the facility is being decommissioned sdge’s ownership interest in songs continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility which include 

 in addition sdge maintains ndts for providing funds to decommission songs trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities which are subject to significant market fluctuations a decline in the market value of trust assets or an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts could increase the funding requirements for these trusts which in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates furthermore cpuc approval is required in order to make withdrawals from these trusts cpuc approval for certain expenditures may be denied by the cpuc altogether if the cpuc determines that the expenditures are unreasonable finally decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the trust funds rate recovery for overruns would require cpuc approval which may not occur 

interpretations of tax regulations could impact access to ndt funds for reimbursement of spent nuclear fuel management costs in december 2016 the irs and the us department of treasury issued proposed regulations that clarify the definition of “nuclear decommissioning costs” these proposed regulations will be effective prospectively once they are finalized sdge is awaiting the adoption of or additional refinement to the proposed regulations before determining whether the proposed regulations will allow sdge to timely access the ndt funds for reimbursement or payment of the spent fuel management costs incurred in 2017 and subsequent years until the litigation against the doe by edison and sdge seeking recovery of spent fuel management costs is resolved or irs regulations regarding spent fuel management costs are confirmed to apply sdge expects to continue to pay for its share of such spent fuel management costs without reimbursement from the ndt if sdge is unable to obtain timely access to the trusts for these costs sdge’s cash flows could be negatively impacted 

the occurrence of any of these events could result in a substantial reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

risks related to our interest in oncor 

certain ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management and policies of oncor 

various “ringfencing” measures are in place to enhance oncor’s separateness from its owners and to mitigate the risk that oncor would be negatively impacted in the event of a bankruptcy or other adverse financial developments affecting its owners this ringfence creates both legal and financial separation between oncor holdings oncor and their subsidiaries on the one hand and sempra energy and its affiliates and subsidiaries on the other hand 

in accordance with the ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments we made in connection with the merger we and oncor are subject to various restrictions including among others 

 as a result we do not control oncor holdings or oncor and we have limited ability to direct the management policies and operations of oncor holdings and oncor including the deployment or disposition of their assets declarations of dividends strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions we have limited representation on the oncor holdings and oncor board of directors which are controlled by independent directors the oncor directors have considerable autonomy and as described in our commitments have a duty to act in the best interest of oncor consistent with the approved ringfence and delaware law which may be contrary to our best interests or be in opposition to our preferred strategic direction for oncor to the extent that they take actions that are not in our interests the financial condition results of operations andor prospects of sempra energy may be materially adversely affected 

if oncor fails to respond to challenges in the electric utility industry including changes in regulation its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and this could materially adversely affect us 

because oncor is regulated by both us federal and texas state authorities it has been and will continue to be affected by legislative and regulatory developments the costs and burdens associated with complying with these regulatory requirements and adjusting oncor’s business to legislative and regulatory developments may have a material adverse effect on oncor moreover 

potential legislative changes regulatory changes or other market or industry changes may create greater risks to the predictability of utility earnings generally if oncor does not successfully respond to these changes it could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations financial condition andor prospects which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition andor prospects  

oncor’s operations are capital intensive and it could have liquidity needs that may require us to make additional investments in oncor 

oncor’s business is capital intensive and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements in the past oncor has financed a substantial portion of its cash needs with the proceeds from indebtedness in the event that oncor fails to meet its capital requirements we may elect to make additional investments in oncor similarly if oncor is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs we may elect to make additional investments in oncor which could be substantial and which would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition andor prospects in that regard our commitments to the puct prohibit us from making loans to oncor as a result if oncor requires additional financing and cannot obtain it from other sources we may elect to make a capital contribution rather than a loan to oncor 

sempra energy could incur substantial tax liabilities if efh’s 2016 spinoff of vistra from efh is deemed to be taxable 

as part of its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings in 2016 efh distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary vistra energy corp formerly tceh corp and referred to herein as vistra to certain creditors of tceh llc the spinoff and vistra became an independent publicly traded company vistra’s spinoff from efh was intended to qualify for partially taxfree treatment to efh and its stockholders under sections 368a1g 355 and 356 of the irc collectively referred to as the intended tax treatment in connection with and as a condition to the spinoff efh received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain issues relating to the intended tax treatment of the spinoff as well as tax opinions from counsel to efh and vistra regarding certain aspects of the spinoff not covered by the private letter ruling 

in connection with the signing and closing of the merger efh sought and received a supplemental private letter ruling from the irs and sempra energy and efh received tax opinions from their respective counsel that generally provide that the merger will not affect the conclusions reached in respectively the irs private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spinoff described above similar to the irs private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spinoff the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs and any opinions issued with respect to the merger are based on factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by sempra energy and efh now sempra texas holdings corp and a subsidiary of sempra energy if such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete any such undertakings are not complied with or the facts upon which the irs supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions which will not impact the irs position on the transactions are based are different from the actual facts relating to the merger the tax opinions andor supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and as a result could be successfully challenged by the irs if it is determined that the merger causes the spinoff not to qualify for the intended tax treatment sempra energy through its ownership of sempra texas holdings corp could incur substantial tax liabilities which would materially reduce and potentially eliminate the value associated with our indirect investment in oncor and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition andor prospects of sempra energy and on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities should the irs invalidate the private letter ruling andor the supplemental private letter ruling sempra texas holdings corp has administrative appeal rights including the right to challenge any adverse irs position in court 

risks related to our businesses other than the california utilities and our interest in oncor 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled be completed within budget or operate at expected levels which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the acquisition development construction and expansion of lng liquefaction marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels and lpg terminals and storage natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution infrastructure and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built 

success in developing a project is contingent upon among other things 



 successful completion of a project may be materially adversely affected by among other factors 

 if we are unable to complete a development project or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of liquefaction regasification and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution infrastructure or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt liquefaction generation regasification storage transmission and distribution systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the design development and construction of the cameron lng liquefaction facility involves numerous risks and uncertainties 

we have a 502 interest in cameron lng jv which is building an lng export facility consisting of three liquefaction trains designed to a total nameplate capacity of 139 mtpa of lng with an expected export capability of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf per day 

cameron lng jv has a lumpsum turnkey epc contract with a jv between cbi llc as assignee of cbi shaw constructors inc a wholly owned subsidiary of mcdermott international inc and chiyoda international corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of chiyoda corporation if the epc contractor becomes unwilling or unable to perform according to the terms and timetable of the epc contract the project could face substantial construction delays and potentially significantly increased costs in january 2020 mcdermott international inc filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code mcdermott international inc has stated that it expects all of its projects including the threetrain liquefaction project at cameron lng jv to continue on an uninterrupted basis however we cannot be certain the cameron lng jv project will not be interrupted if the contractor defaults under the epc contract due to the bankruptcy of mcdermott international inc or for any other reason such default could result in cameron lng jv’s engagement of a substitute contractor the inability to complete the project in a timely manner or within our current expectations cost overruns and the other risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition credit ratings andor prospects 

if the estimated construction financing and other project costs for the facility substantially exceed our contingency associated with the project budget adopted at the time of our final investment decision we may have to make material additional unexpected cash contributions the majority of the investment in the liquefaction project is projectfinanced and the balance is provided by the project partners any failure by the project partners to make their required investments on a timely basis could result in project delays and could materially adversely affect the development of the project in addition sempra energy has guaranteed a maximum of up to 40 billion related to the project financing and financingrelated agreements these guarantees terminate upon cameron lng jv achieving “financial completion” of the initial threetrain liquefaction project including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests cameron lng jv’s loan facility agreements and related finance documents contain events of default customary for such financings including a failure to achieve financial completion of the project by a financial completion deadline date of september 30 2021 with up to an additional 365 days extension beyond such date permitted in cases of force majeure a delay in construction that results in a failure to achieve financial completion of the project by this financial completion deadline date would therefore result in an event of default under 

cameron lng jv’s financing and a potential demand on sempra energy’s guarantees we anticipate that the guarantees will be terminated approximately nine months after all three trains achieve commercial operation if due to cameron lng jv’s failure to satisfy the financial completion criteria we are required to repay some or all of the 40 billion under our guarantees any such repayments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

we face many challenges to develop and complete our contemplated lng export facilities 

in addition to the threetrain cameron lng liquefaction facility described above we are evaluating several other lng export development opportunities sempra lng is in discussions with the coowners of cameron lng jv regarding the potential expansion of up to two additional liquefaction trains at the cameron lng liquefaction facility is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project near port arthur texas and through a jv agreement with ienova is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project at ienova’s existing eca lng regasification facility in baja california mexico to be developed in two phases a midscale project referred to as eca lng jv phase 1 and a largescale project referred to as eca lng jv phase 2 each of these contemplated projects face numerous risks and must overcome significant hurdles before we can reach a final investment decision and proceed with construction further a shift in the supply of natural gas could depress lng prices and the cost advantages of exporting lng from the us in addition global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections could reduce the demand for natural gas in some sectors and cause a corresponding reduction in projected global demand for lng this could result in increased competition among those developing projects in an environment of declining lng demand such as the sempra energysponsored export initiatives such reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation which could also lead to increased competition among the lng suppliers for the declining lng demand at certain moderate levels oil prices could also make lng projects in other parts of the world more feasible and competitive with lng projects from north america thus increasing supply and the competition for the available lng demand a decline in natural gas prices outside the us which in many foreign countries are based on the price of crude oil may also materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices based on henry hub pricing 

in connection with these lng export development opportunities which we discuss further in “item 7 mda – capital resources and liquidity – sempra lng” we have entered into or may enter into heads of agreements mous andor similar agreements all of which are or will be nonbinding and do not or will not obligate any of the parties to execute any agreements or participate in any such opportunities 

any decisions by sempra energy or our potential counterparties to proceed with binding agreements with respect to the potential development or expansion of our liquefaction projects will require among other things obtaining customer commitments to purchase lng completion of project assessments and achieving other necessary internal and external approvals of each party in addition all our proposed projects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the receipt of a number of permits and approvals finding suitable additional partners and customers obtaining financing and incentives negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including equity acquisition and governance agreements natural gas supply and transportation agreements lng sale and purchase agreements and construction contracts and reaching a final investment decision 

furthermore there are a number of potential new projects under construction or in the process of development by various project developers in north america in addition to ours and given the projected global demand for lng the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed with respect to our port arthur texas project this is a greenfield site and therefore it may not have the advantages often associated with brownfield sites the eca lng regasification facility and eca lng jv proposed liquefaction project in mexico are subject to ongoing land and permit disputes that could make project financing as well as finding suitable partners and customers difficult in addition while we have completed the regulatory process for an lng export facility in the us the regulatory process in mexico and the overlay of us regulations for natural gas exports to an lng export facility in mexico are not well developed there can be no assurance that a facility could be constructed without facing significant legal challenges and uncertainties which in turn could make project financing as well as finding suitable partners and customers for eca lng jv phase 2 difficult finally the eca lng regasification facility currently has profitable longterm regasification contracts for 100 of the regasification facility’s capacity through 2028 making the decision to pursue eca lng jv phase 2 dependent in part on whether the investment in a largescale liquefaction project would over the long term be more beneficial than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts 

there can be no assurance that our contemplated lng export facilities will be completed and our inability to complete one or more of our contemplated lng export facilities could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows results of operations and prospects 

domestic and international hydraulic fracturing operations are subject to political economic and other uncertainties that could increase the costs of doing business impose additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect production of lng and reduce or eliminate lng export opportunities and demand 

hydraulic fracturing operations in the us and outside the us face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to their operations several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations to impose more stringent permitting public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations in addition to state laws some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions such as city ordinances that may restrict the performance of or prohibit the well drilling in general andor hydraulic fracturing in particular we cannot predict whether additional federal state local or international laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit if additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations natural gas prices in north america could rise which in turn could materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices based on henry hub pricing increased regulation or difficulty in permitting of hydraulic fracturing and any corresponding increase in domestic natural gas prices could materially adversely affect demand for lng exports and our ability to develop commercially viable lng export facilities beyond the threetrain cameron lng facility currently under construction 

our businesses are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices and our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for lng facilities or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas lng electricity or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated commodities can result from multiple factors such as adverse weather conditions commodity production levels and energy and environmental regulations and legislation 

when our businesses enter into fixedprice longterm contracts to provide services or commodities they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks 

sempra mexico and sempra lng generally endeavor to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure however if these contracts are at fixed prices the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures including rising operational costs costs of labor materials equipment and commodities and rising interest rates that affect financing costs we may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects providing for cost escalation providing for direct passthrough of operating costs or entering into hedges however these measures if implemented may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses andor financing costs the failure to fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

increased competition and changes in trade policies could materially adversely affect us 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors many of whom have extensive and diversified development andor operating experience including both domestic and international and financial resources similar to or greater than ours further in recent years the natural gas pipeline storage and lng market segments have been characterized by strong and increasing competition both with respect to winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets in mexico despite the commissioning of many new energy infrastructure projects by the cfe and other governmental agencies in connection with energy reforms competition for recent pipeline projects has been intense with numerous bidders competing aggressively for these projects there can be no assurance that we will be successful in bidding for new development opportunities in the us and mexico these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

in addition the current us administration has indicated its intention to revise or replace international trade agreements such as nafta in november 2018 president trump signed the usmca which if approved by the legislatures of the us mexico and canada would replace nafta the us and mexico approved the usmca in january 2020 and june 2019 respectively but canada has yet to provide its approval a shift in us trade policies could materially adversely affect our lng development opportunities as well as opportunities for trade between mexico and the us 

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into extend or replace expiring longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our 

businesses to increased competition such longterm contracts once entered into increase our credit risk if our counterparties fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis due to bankruptcy insolvency or otherwise 

the eca lng regasification facility has longterm capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties under these agreements customers pay capacity reservation and usage fees to receive store and regasify the customers’ lng we also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the eca lng regasification facility were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

for the threetrain liquefaction facility currently under construction by cameron lng cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of total sa mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd that subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the facility if the counterparties to these tolling agreements were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations to cameron lng jv on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

sempra mexico’s and sempra lng’s ability to enter into or replace existing longterm firm capacity agreements for their natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include our lng facilities a significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility and we may be unable to sell the power that sempra mexico’s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to perform we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses and the businesses that we invest in are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements or arrangements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements or arrangements should they fail to perform we may be required to enter into alternative arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such an event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition many such agreements are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses the failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects finally we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

certain past assertions made by the cfe and mexican government coupled with past arbitration requests and other statements and actions by the cfe raise serious concerns over whether the terms of sempra mexico’s gas pipeline contracts will be honored or disputed in arbitration the failure by the cfe or other customers to honor the terms of sempra mexico’s gas pipeline contracts and the inability to enter into gas pipeline contracts in the future could have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sempra mexico’s and sempra lng’s obligations and those of their suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for “force majeure” events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

in addition we may develop andor own some projects with other equity owners and therefore we may not control all material decisions with respect to those projects as is the case with the cameron lng jv project to the extent that there is disagreement amongst the project equity owners with respect to certain decisions affecting such a project the development construction or 

operation of such project may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected such a circumstance could materially adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows result of operations andor prospects 

our businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits 

we are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties adjacent to and properties where our eca lng regasification facility and eca lng jv proposed liquefaction project in mexico are located as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements if we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which these current and proposed facilities are located we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related facilities which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such facilities in addition our ability to construct an lng liquefaction export facility may be hindered or halted by these disputes and they could make project financing such a facility and finding suitable partners and customers very difficult if we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related facilities it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

we rely on transportation assets and services much of which we do not own or control to deliver natural gas and electricity 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to 

 sempra mexico and sempra lng also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra mexico and sempra lng also rely on specialized ships to transport lng to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities sempra mexico’s subsidiaries as well as our south american businesses that are held for sale rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities electricity and other services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity natural gas supplies and lng at thencurrent spot market rates which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges 

in mexico we own or have interests in natural gas distribution and transportation assets lpg storage and transportation facilities ethane transportation assets electricity generation facilities lng facilities and ethane and liquid fuels marine and inland terminals in peru and chile we own or have interests in electric transmission distribution and generation infrastructure and operations which are held for sale developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant security political legal regulatory and financial risks that vary by country including 

 in addition the mexican government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over the mexican economy accordingly mexican governmental actions concerning the economy and certain governmental agencies including the cfe 

could have a significant impact on mexican private sector entities in general and on ienova’s operations in particular for example the cfe and the mexican government took certain actions in 2019 that raised serious concerns over whether the terms of sempra mexico’s gas pipeline contracts would be honored or disputed in arbitration ienova and other affected natural gas pipeline developers joined the cfe and the president of mexico’s representatives in negotiations and were able to resolve the dispute but we cannot predict whether similar disputes may arise andor whether such disputes will be resolved on favorable terms to us if at all we also cannot predict the impact that the political landscape including multiparty rule and civil disobedience will have on the mexican economy such circumstances may materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects in mexico which could have a material adverse effect on sempra’s consolidated financial statements 

we discuss litigation related to sempra mexico’s international energy projects in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other risks 

sempra energy has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control 

sempra energy makes investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control as described above sdge holds a 20 ownership interest in songs which is in the process of being decommissioned by edison its majority owner as a result of ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments we account for our indirect 100 ownership interest in oncor holdings which at december 31 2019 owns an 8025 interest in oncor as an equity method investment sempra lng accounts for its 502 interest in cameron lng jv under the equity method sempra mexico has a 40 interest in a jv with a subsidiary of tc energy to build own and operate the sur de texastuxpan natural gas marine pipeline in mexico a 50 interest in a renewables wind project in baja california and a 50 interest in the los ramones norte pipeline in mexico sempra energy has an equity method investment in the rbs sempra commodities partnership which is in the process of being dissolved and for which sempra energy is subject to certain indemnities as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements any adverse resolution of matters associated with our ownership interest in the rbs sempra commodities partnership could have a corresponding impact on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

sempra lng provided guarantees related to cameron lng jv’s financing agreements and sempra mexico has provided loans to jvs in which they have investments we discuss the guarantees in note 6 and affiliate loans in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have limited influence over these ventures and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest in addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we discuss our investments further in notes 5 6 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

market performance or changes in other assumptions could require sempra energy sdge andor socalgas to make significant unplanned contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees a decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans in addition the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors including the assumed rate of return on plan assets employee demographics discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations rates of increase in health care costs levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation an adverse change in any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

impairment of goodwill would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

as of december 31 2019 sempra energy had approximately 1602 million of goodwill which represented approximately 244 of the total assets on its consolidated balance sheet primarily related to the acquisitions of ienova pipelines and ventika in mexico goodwill is not amortized but we test it for impairment annually on october 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation which could result in our recording a goodwill impairment loss we discuss our annual goodwill impairment testing process and the factors considered in such testing in “item 7 mda – critical 

accounting policies and estimates” and in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements a goodwill impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which such charge is recorded

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 



overview 

in 2018 we set out to simplify sempra energy’s business model and sharpen our focus on building north america’s premier energy infrastructure company our 2019 operational and financial results reflect our focus on executing this strategy 

 our south american businesses and certain activities associated with those businesses have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented nominal activities that are not classified as discontinued operations have been subsumed into parent and other our discussions below exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted 



results of operations 

we discuss the following in results of operations 



overall results of operations of sempra energy 

in 2019  our earnings increased by approximately 1131 million to 2055 million and our diluted eps increased by 387 to 729  in 2018 compared to 2017  our earnings increased by 668 million to 924 million and our diluted eps increased by 241 to 342  the change in diluted eps for 2019 and 2018 included decreases of 033 and 024 respectively attributable to an increase in weightedaverage common shares outstanding our earnings and diluted eps were impacted by variances discussed in “segment results” below 

segment results 

the following section presents earnings losses by sempra energy segment as well as parent and other and the related discussion of the changes in segment earnings losses throughout the mda our reference to earnings represents earnings attributable to common shares variance amounts presented are the aftertax earnings impact based on applicable statutory tax rates unless otherwise noted and before nci where applicable as we discuss below in “significant changes in revenues costs and earnings – income taxes” in december 2017 the tcja was signed into law the tcja reduced the us statutory corporate federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 aftertax variances between 2018 and 2017 assume that amounts in both years were taxed at the 2017 statutory rate 





sdge 

the increase in earnings of 98 million  15  in 2019 was primarily due to 

 the increase in earnings of 262 million in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to 

 socalgas 

the increase in earnings of 241 million in 2019 was primarily due to 

 the increase in earnings of 4 million  1  in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to 



 sempra texas utilities 

the increase in earnings of 157 million  42  in 2019 primarily represents higher equity earnings from oncor holdings which we acquired in march 2018 driven by the impact of oncor’s acquisition of infrareit in may 2019 and higher revenues due to rate updates to reflect increases in invested transmission capital partially offset by higher operating costs 

earnings of 371 million in 2018 represent equity earnings from our investment in oncor holdings 

sempra mexico 

the increase in earnings of 16 million  7  in 2019 was primarily due to 

 the increase in earnings of 68 million  40  in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to 

 sempra renewables 

as we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sempra renewables sold its remaining wind assets and investments in april 2019 upon which date the segment ceased to exist 

the decrease in earnings of 269 million in 2019 was primarily due to 



the increase in earnings of 76 million  30  in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to 

 sempra lng 

the decrease in losses of 611 million in 2019 was primarily due to 

 losses of 617 million in 2018 compared to earnings of 150 million in 2017 were primarily due to 

 parent and other 

the decrease in losses of 105 million  17  in 2019 was primarily due to 



the decrease in losses of 440 million  42  in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to 

 discontinued operations 

discontinued operations that were previously in our sempra south american utilities segment include our 100 interest in chilquinta energía in chile our 836 interest in luz del sur in peru and our interests in two energyservices companies tecnored and tecsur which provide electric construction and infrastructure services to chilquinta energía and luz del sur respectively as well as third parties discontinued operations also include activities mainly income taxes related to the south american businesses that were previously included in the holding company of the south american businesses at parent and other 

the increase in earnings of 172 million in 2019 was primarily due to 

 earnings of 156 million in 2018 compared to losses of 58 million in 2017 were primarily due to a 251 million unfavorable impact in 2017 from the tcja offset by 44 million income tax expense in 2018 to adjust provisional amounts recorded in 2017 

significant changes in revenues costs and earnings 

this section contains a discussion of the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of operations for sempra energy sdge and socalgas 

utilities revenues 

our utilities revenues include natural gas revenues at our california utilities and sempra mexico’s ecogas and electric revenues at sdge intercompany revenues included in the separate revenues of each utility are eliminated in the sempra energy consolidated statements of operations 

socalgas and sdge currently operate under a regulatory framework that permits 

 because changes in socalgas’ and sdge’s cost of natural gas andor electricity are recovered in rates changes in these costs are offset in the changes in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings in addition to the changes in cost or market prices 

natural gas or electric revenues recorded during a period are impacted by customer billing cycles causing a difference between customer billings and recorded or authorized costs these differences are required to be balanced over time resulting in over and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts we discuss balancing accounts and their effects further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the table below summarizes utilities revenues and cost of sales 



natural gas revenues and cost of natural gas 

the table below summarizes the average cost of natural gas sold by the california utilities and included in cost of natural gas the average cost of natural gas sold at each utility is impacted by market prices as well as transportation tariff and other charges 



in 2019  our natural gas revenues increased by 645 million  14  to 52 billion primarily due to 



 in 2018 compared to 2017  our natural gas revenues increased by 179 million  4  to 45 billion primarily due to 

 our cost of natural gas decreased by 69 million  6  to 11 billion in 2019 primarily due to 

 our cost of natural gas increased by 18 million  2  remaining at 12 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to 

 electric revenues and cost of electric fuel and purchased power 

our electric revenues increased by 264 million  7  to  43 billion in 2019 primarily attributable to sdge including 

 in 2018 compared to 2017  our electric revenues increased by 70 million  2  to 40 billion primarily attributable to sdge including 

 our utility cost of electric fuel and purchased power decreased by 170 million  13  to 12 billion in 2019  primarily attributable to sdge including 

 our utility cost of electric fuel and purchased power increased by 65 million  5  to 14 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily attributable to sdge driven primarily by higher gas prices and electricity market costs partially offset by lower cost of purchased power from renewable sources due to decreased solar and wind production and from lower capacity contract costs 

energyrelated businesses revenues and cost of sales 

the table below shows revenues and cost of sales for our energyrelated businesses 



 

revenues from our energyrelated businesses decreased by 182 million  12  to 14 billion in 2019 while the related cost of sales for 2019 was comparable to 2018 the decrease in revenues included 



 in 2018 compared to 2017  revenues from our energyrelated businesses increased by 213 million  16  to 16 billion  the increase included 

 the cost of sales for our energyrelated businesses increased by 66 million  23  to 357 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to 



operation and maintenance 

in the table below we provide om by segment 



 

our om increased by 316 million  10  to 35 billion in 2019 primarily due to 

 our om increased by 203 million  7  to 32 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to 

 writeoff of wildfire regulatory asset 

in 2017 sdge recorded a 351 million charge for the writeoff of a regulatory asset associated with 2007 wildfire costs we discuss this further in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment losses 

in 2019 socalgas recognized a 29 million impairment loss related to nonutility native gas assets and sdge and socalgas recognized impairment losses of 6 million and 8 million respectively for certain disallowed capital costs in the 2019 grc fd in 2018 sempra lng recognized a 11 billion net impairment loss for certain nonutility natural gas storage assets in the southeast us in 2017 sempra mexico reduced the carrying value of tdm by recognizing noncash impairment charges of 71 million 

gain on sale of assets 

in april 2019 sempra renewables recognized a 61 million gain on the sale of its remaining wind assets and investments to aep in december 2018 sempra renewables recognized a 513 million gain on the sale of all its operating solar assets solar and battery storage development projects and its 50 interest in a wind power generation facility to a subsidiary of con ed 

other income net 

as part of our central risk management function we enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge sempra mexico parent’s exposure to movements in the mexican peso from its controlling interest in ienova the gainslosses associated with these derivatives are included in other income net as described below and partially mitigate the transactional effects of foreign currency and inflation included in income tax expense benefit for sempra mexico’s consolidated entities and in equity earnings for sempra mexico’s equity method investments we also utilize foreign currency derivatives to hedge exposure to fluctuations in the peruvian sol related to the sale of our operations in peru we discuss policies governing our risk management below in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

other income net increased by 19 million 33 to 77 million in 2019 primarily due to 

 in 2018 compared to 2017  other income net decreased by 162 million to 58 million primarily due to 

 we provide further details of the components of other income net in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the table below shows the income tax expense benefit and etrs for sempra energy consolidated sdge and socalgas 



 

in december 2017 the tcja was signed into law we recorded the effects of the tcja in 2017 using our best estimates and the information available to us through the date those financial statements were issued in 2018 we adjusted our 2017 provisional estimates and completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja to the extent we intend to repatriate cash to the us we have accrued incremental deferred income tax we discuss the tcja and our indefinite reinvestment assertion further in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sempra energy consolidated 

sempra energy’s income tax expense in 2019 compared to an income tax benefit in 2018 was due to higher pretax income and a higher etr pretax income in 2018 was impacted by the impairments at our sempra lng and sempra renewables segments offset by the gain from sale of assets at sempra renewables the change in etr was primarily due to 

 sempra energy’s income tax benefit in 2018 compared to an income tax expense in 2017 was due to a lower etr and lower pretax income pretax income in 2017 was impacted by the writeoff of sdge’s wildfire regulatory asset the lower etr was primarily due to 



 we report as part of our pretax results the income or loss attributable to nci however we do not record income taxes for a portion of this income or loss as some of our entities with nci are currently treated as partnerships for income tax purposes and thus we are only liable for income taxes on the portion of the earnings that are allocated to us our pretax income however includes 100 of these entities as our entities with nci grow and as we may continue to invest in such entities the impact on our etr may become more significant 

sdge 

sdge’s income tax expense decreased in 2019 due to a lower etr partially offset by higher pretax income the change in etr was primarily due to a 31 million income tax benefit from the release of a regulatory liability established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the cpuc directed be allocated to shareholders in a january 2019 decision 

sdge’s income tax expense increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher pretax income partially offset by a lower etr the pretax income in 2017 included the 351 million 208 million after tax writeoff of the wildfire regulatory asset the lower etr was primarily due to 

 socalgas 

socalgas’ income tax expense increased in 2019 due to higher pretax income partially offset by a lower etr the change in etr was primarily due to 

 socalgas’ income tax expense decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to lower pretax income and a lower etr the lower etr was primarily due to 



equity earnings 

equity earnings increased by 405 million to 580 million in 2019 primarily due to 



 equity earnings increased by 103 million to 175 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to 

 earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

earnings attributable to nci were 164 million for 2019 compared to 76 million for 2018  the net change of 88 million included 

 earnings attributable to nci were 76 million for 2018 compared to 94 million for 2017  the net change of 18 million included 

 mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends 

mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends increased by 17 million 14 to 142 million in 2019 primarily due to dividends associated with our series b preferred stock which were issued in july 2018 

in 2018 our board of directors declared dividends of 105 million and 20 million respectively on our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock 

impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations 

because operations in south america and our natural gas distribution utility in mexico use their local currency as their functional currency revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates for the period for consolidation in sempra energy consolidated’s results of operations 

foreign currency translation 

any difference in average exchange rates used for the translation of income statement activity from year to year can cause a variance in sempra energy’s comparative results of operations changes in foreign currency translation rates between years resulted in 8 million lower earnings within discontinued operations in 2019 compared to 2018 and a negligible impact in 2018 compared to 2017 

transactional impacts 

income statement activities at our foreign operations and their jvs are also impacted by transactional gains and losses a summary of these foreign currency transactional gains and losses included in our reported results is shown in the table below 



foreign currency exchange rate and inflation impacts on income taxes and related hedging activity 

our mexican subsidiaries have us dollardenominated cash balances receivables payables and debt monetary assets and liabilities that are affected by mexican currency exchange rate movements for mexican income tax purposes they also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are significant denominated in the mexican peso that must be translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes in addition monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes as a result fluctuations in both the currency exchange rate for the mexican peso against the us dollar and mexican inflation may expose us to fluctuations in income tax expense other income net and equity earnings we use foreign currency derivatives as a means to manage exposure to the currency exchange rate on our monetary assets and liabilities however we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities which makes us susceptible to volatility in income tax expense caused by exchange rate fluctuations and inflation the derivative activity impacts other income net 

we also utilize foreign currency derivatives to hedge exposure to fluctuation in the peruvian sol related to the sale of our operations in peru in discontinued operations 

other transactions 

although the financial statements of most of our mexican subsidiaries and jvs have the us dollar as the functional currency some transactions may be denominated in the local currency such transactions are remeasured into us dollars this remeasurement creates transactional gains and losses that are included in other income net for our consolidated subsidiaries and in equity earnings for our jvs 

we utilize crosscurrency swaps that exchange our mexican pesodenominated principal and interest payments into the us dollar and swap mexican variable interest rates for us fixed interest rates the impacts of these crosscurrency swaps are offset in oci and are reclassified from aoci into earnings through other income net and interest expense as settlements occur 

certain of our mexican pipeline projects namely los ramones i at ienova pipelines and los ramones norte within our tag jv generate revenue based on tariffs that are set by government agencies in mexico with contracts denominated in mexican pesos that are indexed to the us dollar adjusted annually for inflation and fluctuation in the exchange rate the resultant gains and losses from remeasuring the local currency amounts into us dollars and the settlement of foreign currency forwards and swaps related to these contracts are included in revenues energyrelated businesses or equity earnings 



capital resources and liquidity 

overview 

we expect to meet our cash requirements through cash flows from operations unrestricted cash and cash equivalents proceeds from recent and planned asset sales borrowings under our credit facilities distributions from our equity method investments issuances of debt and equity securities project financing and other equity sales including partnering in jvs we believe that these cash flow sources combined with available funds will be adequate to fund our current operations including to 

 sempra energy and the california utilities currently have ready access to the longterm debt markets and are not currently constrained in their ability to borrow at reasonable rates however changing economic conditions our financing activities and actions by credit rating agencies as well as many other factors could negatively affect the availability and cost of both shortterm and longterm financing also cash flows from operations may be impacted by the timing of commencement and completion and potentially cost overruns of large projects if cash flows from operations were to be significantly reduced or we were unable to borrow under acceptable terms we would likely first reduce or postpone discretionary capital expenditures not related to safety and investments in new businesses we monitor our ability to finance the needs of our operating investing and financing activities in a manner consistent with our intention to maintain our investmentgrade credit ratings and capital structure 

we have significant investments in several trusts to provide for future payments of pensions and other postretirement benefits and nuclear decommissioning changes in asset values which are dependent on the activity in the equity and fixed income markets have not affected the trust funds’ abilities to make required payments however changes in asset values along with a number of other factors such as changes to discount rates assumed rates of return mortality tables and regulations may impact funding requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and sdge’s ndt at the california utilities funding requirements are generally recoverable in rates 

available funds 

our lines of credit provide liquidity and support commercial paper as we discuss in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sempra energy sempra global sdge and socalgas each have fiveyear revolving credit agreements expiring in 2024 these credit agreements replaced the credit agreements that were set to expire in 2020 the table below shows the amount of available funds at december 31 2019 including available unused credit on these primary us credit facilities in addition ienova has 19 billion in lines of credit with approximately 706 million available unused credit at december 31 2019  



 shortterm borrowings 

we use shortterm debt primarily to meet liquidity requirements fund shareholder dividends and temporarily finance capital expenditures acquisitions or startups our corporate shortterm unsecured promissory notes or commercial paper were our primary sources of shortterm debt funding in 2019  our california utilities use shortterm debt primarily to meet working capital needs 

the following table shows selected statistics for our commercial paper borrowings for 2019  



 

credit ratings 

the credit ratings of sempra energy sdge and socalgas remained at investment grade levels in 2019 



  

a downgrade of sempra energy’s or any of its subsidiaries’ credit ratings or rating outlooks may result in a requirement for collateral to be posted in the case of certain financing arrangements and may materially and adversely affect the market prices of their equity and debt securities the rates at which borrowings are made and commercial paper is issued and the various fees on their outstanding credit facilities this could make it more costly for sempra energy sdge socalgas and sempra energy’s other subsidiaries to issue debt securities to borrow under credit facilities and to raise certain other types of financing we provide additional information about our credit ratings at sempra energy sdge and socalgas in “item 1a risk factors” 

sempra energy has agreed that if the credit rating of oncor’s senior secured debt by any of the three major rating agencies falls below bbb or the equivalent oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions except for contractual tax payments unless otherwise allowed by the puct oncor’s senior secured debt was rated a2 a and a at moody’s sp and fitch respectively at december 31 2019  

sempra energy sdge and socalgas have committed lines of credit to provide liquidity and to support commercial paper borrowings under these facilities bear interest at benchmark rates plus a margin that varies with market index rates and each borrower’s credit rating each facility also requires a commitment fee on available unused credit that may be impacted by each borrower’s credit rating depending on the severity of the downgrade 

 sempra energy’s and sdge’s credit ratings also may affect their respective credit limits related to derivative instruments as we discuss in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

loans tofrom affiliates 

at december 31 2019  sempra energy had a 742 million loan to an unconsolidated affiliate and 195 million of loans from unconsolidated affiliates 

california utilities 

sdge’s and socalgas’ operations have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity their future performance will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process environmental regulations economic conditions actions by the california legislature and the changing energy marketplace from 2020 through 2024 sdge expects to make capital expenditures of approximately 89 billion and socalgas expects to make capital expenditures of approximately 90 billion for transmission and distribution improvements including pipeline and wildfire safety these amounts are estimates and the actual amounts of capital expenditures may differ perhaps substantially 

sdge and socalgas expect that the available unused credit from their credit facilities described above cash flows from operations and debt issuances will continue to be adequate to fund their respective operations and capital expenditures the california utilities manage their capital structure and pay dividends when appropriate and as approved by their respective boards of directors 

as we discuss in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements changes in balancing accounts for significant costs at sdge and socalgas particularly a change between over and undercollected status including commodity and transportation balancing accounts may have a significant impact on cash flows these changes generally represent the difference between when costs are incurred and when they are ultimately recovered in rates through billings to customers 

sdge 

wildfire fund 

on july 12 2019 the governor of california signed into law the wildfire legislation which addresses certain important issues related to catastrophic wildfires in the state of california and their impact on electric ious we describe the wildfire legislation and related accounting treatment in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the wildfire legislation established the wildfire fund to provide liquidity to sdge pge and edison to pay iou wildfirerelated claims in the event that the governmental agency responsible for determining causation determines the applicable iou’s equipment caused the ignition of a wildfire the primary insurance coverage is exceeded and certain other conditions are satisfied the primary purpose of the wildfire fund is to pool resources provided by shareholders and ratepayers of the ious and make those resources available to reimburse the ious for thirdparty wildfire claims incurred after july 12 2019 the effective date of the wildfire legislation subject to certain limitations 

sdge recorded a wildfire fund asset for committed shareholder contributions to the wildfire fund sdge is exposed to the risk that any california electric iou may incur thirdparty wildfire claims for which they will seek recovery from the wildfire fund in such a situation sdge may recognize a reduction of its wildfire fund asset and record a charge against earnings in the period when there is a reduction of the available coverage due to recoverable claims from the ious as a result if any california electric iou’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire it could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s financial condition and results of operation up to the carrying value of our wildfire fund asset in addition the wildfire fund could be completely exhausted due to fires in the other california electric ious’ service territories by fires in sdge’s service territory or by a combination thereof in the event that the wildfire fund is materially diminished exhausted or terminated sdge will lose the protection afforded by the wildfire fund and as a consequence a fire in sdge’s service territory could cause a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

socalgas 

socalgas’ performance will also depend on the resolution of legal regulatory and other matters concerning the leak at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility which we discuss below in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 1a risk factors” 

aliso canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak 

in october 2015 socalgas discovered a leak at one of its injectionandwithdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility located in los angeles county in february 2016 calgem confirmed that the well was permanently sealed see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussions of “civil and criminal litigation” and “regulatory proceedings” 

cost estimates accounting impacts and insurance at december 31 2019 socalgas estimates its costs related to the leak are 1116 million the cost estimate this estimate may rise significantly as more information becomes available approximately 

51 of the cost estimate is for the temporary relocation program including cleaning costs and certain labor costs a substantial portion of the cost estimate has been paid and 9 million is accrued as reserve for aliso canyon costs and 7 million is accrued in deferred credits and other as of december 31 2019 on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s consolidated balance sheets 

except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions the cost estimate does not include litigation or regulatory costs as it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the costs to defend or resolve the actions or the amount of damages restitution or civil administrative or criminal fines sanctions penalties or other costs or remedies that may be imposed or incurred which could be significant the cost estimate also does not include certain other costs incurred by sempra energy associated with defending against shareholder derivative lawsuits and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate 

excluding directors’ and officers’ liability insurance we have at least four kinds of insurance policies that together we estimate provide between 12 billion to 14 billion in insurance coverage depending on the nature of the claims we have received insurance payments for many of the costs including temporary relocation and associated processing costs controlofwell expenses costs of the governmentordered response to the leak legal costs and lost gas we intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for the costs we have incurred or may incur there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for these costs if any costs are not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits if there are significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible such amounts could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2019 we recorded the expected recovery of the cost estimate related to the leak of 339 million as insurance receivable for aliso canyon costs on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s consolidated balance sheets this amount is net of insurance retentions and 747 million of insurance proceeds we received through december 31 2019 if we were to conclude that this receivable or a portion of it is no longer probable of recovery from insurers some or all of this receivable would be charged against earnings which could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

natural gas storage operations and reliability natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods including peak electric generation needs in the summer and heating needs in the winter the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility is the largest socalgas storage facility and an important element of socalgas’ delivery system as a result of the leak socalgas suspended injection of natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility beginning in october 2015 and following a comprehensive safety review and authorization by calgem and the cpuc’s executive director resumed limited injection operations in july 2017 

during the suspension period socalgas advised the california iso cec cpuc and phmsa of its concerns that the inability to inject natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility posed a risk to energy reliability in southern california the cpuc has issued a series of directives to socalgas specifying the range of working gas to be maintained in the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility as well as protocols for the withdrawal of gas to help ensure safe and reliable natural gas service while helping to maintain stable energy prices in southern california limited withdrawals of natural gas from the facility were made in 2018 and 2019 to augment natural gas supplies during critical demand periods 

if the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value it could result in an impairment of the facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs andor additional capital expenditures and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized at december 31 2019 the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of 769 million  any significant impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations for the period in which it is recorded higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas may not be recoverable in customer rates and socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

sempra texas utilities 

oncor’s business is capital intensive and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements from 2020 through 2024 oncor expects to make capital expenditures of approximately 119 billion to meet the projected growth within its service territory of which approximately 95 billion represents our proportionate ownership share we expect oncor will fund approximately 88 billion of these capital expenditures and sempra energy will fund approximately 07 billion through capital contributions to oncor these amounts are estimates and the actual amounts of capital expenditures and investments may differ perhaps substantially in the past oncor has financed a substantial portion of its cash needs from operations and with proceeds from indebtedness in the event that oncor fails to meet its capital requirements we may be required to make additional capital contributions to oncor or if oncor is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs we may elect to make additional capital contributions to oncor which could be substantial and which would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects in that regard our commitments to the puct prohibit us from making loans to oncor as a result if oncor requires additional financing and cannot obtain it from other sources we may elect to make a capital contribution to oncor 

oncor’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by factors such as its credit ratings regulatory capital requirements debttoequity ratio approved by the puct and other restrictions in addition oncor will not pay dividends if a majority of oncor’s independent directors or any minority member director determines it is in the best interests of oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements 

sempra mexico 

sempra mexico is currently building terminals for the receipt storage and delivery of liquid fuels in the new port of veracruz and vicinity of mexico city puebla topolobampo manzanillo and ensenada sempra mexico is also developing new solar facilities in juárez chihuahua and benjamin hill sonora through which it will supply renewable energy to several private companies we expect the projects to commence commercial operation on various dates in 2020 and 2021 from 2020 through 2024 sempra mexico and its unconsolidated jv’s expect to make capital expenditures and investments of approximately 20 billion which represents our proportionate ownership share before nci we expect sempra mexico’s unconsolidated jv’s will fund approximately 01 billion of these capital expenditures which represents our proportionate ownership share and sempra mexico will fund approximately 19 billion these amounts are estimates and the actual amounts of capital expenditures and investments may differ perhaps substantially we expect to fund these capital expenditures and investments operations and dividends at ienova with available funds including credit facilities and funds internally generated by the sempra mexico businesses as well as funds from project financing sales of securities interim funding from the parent or affiliates and partnering in jvs 

in 2019 2018 and 2017 ienova paid dividends of 73 million 71 million and 67 million respectively to its minority shareholders 

ienova’s shareholders approved ienova’s repurchases of its own shares up to a maximum amount of 250 million repurchases shall not exceed ienova’s total net profits including retained earnings as stated in its financial statements in 2019 ienova repurchased 2620000 shares of its outstanding common stock held by nci for approximately 10 million  resulting in an increase in sempra energy’s ownership interest in ienova from 665 to 666 as of december 31 2019 

as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements ienova has received force majeure payments for the guaymasel oro segment of the sonora pipeline from august 2017 to august 2019 after damage to that segment of the pipeline made it inoperable and a court order prevented repairs to put the pipeline back in service in july 2019 the cfe filed a request for arbitration generally to nullify certain contract terms that provide for fixed capacity payments in instances of force majeure and made a demand for substantial damages in connection with the force majeure event in september 2019 the arbitration process ended when ienova and the cfe reached an agreement to modify the tariff structure and extend the term of the contract for 10 years under the revised agreement the cfe will resume making payments only when the damaged section of the guaymasel oro segment of the sonora pipeline is repaired if the pipeline is not repaired by may 15 2020 and the parties do not agree on a new service start date ienova retains the right to terminate the contract and seek to recover its reasonable and documented costs and lost profits if ienova is unable to make such repairs which have not commenced and resume operations in the guaymasel oro segment of the sonora pipeline or if ienova terminates the contract and is unable to obtain recovery there may be a material adverse impact on sempra energy’s results of operations and cash flows and our ability to recover the carrying value of our investment 

the ability to successfully complete major construction projects is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties see “item 1a risk factors” 

sempra lng 

sempra lng develops and builds natural gas liquefaction facilities and is pursuing the development of five strategically located lng projects in north america with a longterm goal of delivering natural gas to the largest world markets we expect sempra lng to require funding for the development and expansion of its portfolio of projects which may be financed through a combination of operating cash flow funding from the parent project financing and partnering in jvs  including its jv partnership with ienova in eca lng jv from 2020 through 2024 sempra lng and its unconsolidated jv expect to make capital expenditures and investments of approximately 24 billion which represents our proportionate ownership share before nci we expect sempra lng’s unconsolidated jv will fund approximately 01 billion of these capital expenditures which represents our proportionate ownership share and sempra lng will fund approximately 23 billion these amounts are estimates and the actual amounts of capital expenditures and investments may differ perhaps substantially these capital expenditures are primarily for construction of the proposed midscale liquefaction project at eca lng jv which we discuss below 

north american natural gas prices when in decline negatively affect profitability at sempra lng also a reduction in projected global demand for lng could result in increased competition among those developing projects in an environment of declining lng demand such as the sempra energysponsored lng export initiatives for a discussion of these risks and other risks involving changing commodity prices see “item 1a risk factors” 

cameron lng jv threetrain liquefaction project 

sempra lng through its interest in cameron lng jv is constructing a threetrain natural gas liquefaction export facility with an expected export capability of 12 mtpa of lng construction on the threetrain liquefaction project began in the second half of 2014 under an epc contract with a jv between cbi llc as assignee of cbi shaw constructors inc a wholly owned subsidiary of mcdermott international inc and chiyoda international corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of chiyoda corporation the majority of the construction is projectfinanced at the jv with most or all of the remainder of the capital requirements provided by the project partners including sempra energy through equity contributions under the project equity agreements we expect that our remaining equity requirements to complete the project will be met by a combination of our share of cash generated from each liquefaction train as it comes on line and if required additional cash contributions sempra energy signed guarantees for 502 of cameron lng jv’s financing obligations for a maximum amount of up to 40 billion the guarantees will terminate upon satisfaction of certain conditions including all three trains achieving financial completion by september 30 2021 with up to an additional 365 days extension beyond such date permitted in cases of force majeure however if cameron lng jv fails to satisfy the financial completion criteria a demand could be made under the guarantee for sempra energy’s 502 of cameron lng jv’s obligations under the financing arrangements then due and payable 

in august 2019 commercial operation of train 1 commenced under cameron lng jv’s tolling agreements in february 2020 train 2 reached substantial completion and we expect to commence commercial operation in the coming days based on a number of factors we believe it is reasonable to expect train 3 will commence commercial operation in the third quarter of 2020 these factors include among others the epc contractor’s progress to date the current commissioning activities the remaining work to be performed the project schedules received from the epc contractor cameron lng jv’s own review of the project schedules the assumptions underlying such schedules and the inherent risks in constructing and testing facilities such as the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility 

largescale construction projects like the design development and construction of the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility involve numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the potential for unforeseen engineering challenges severe weather events substantial construction delays and increased costs in addition once completed the facility may be subject to design flaws equipment failures and other operational issues which could cause the facility to suspend operations or operate at a reduced capacity 

cameron lng jv has a lumpsum turnkey epc contract and if the contractor becomes unwilling or unable to perform according to the terms and timetable of the epc contract the project could face substantial construction delays and potentially significantly increased costs in january 2020 mcdermott international inc filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code mcdermott international inc has stated that it expects all of its projects including the threetrain liquefaction project at cameron lng jv to continue on an uninterrupted basis however we cannot be certain the cameron lng jv project will not be interrupted if the contractor defaults under the epc contract due to the bankruptcy of mcdermott international inc or for any other reason such default could result in cameron lng jv’s engagement of a substitute contractor the inability to complete the project in a timely manner or within our current expectations cost overruns and the other risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition credit ratings andor prospects 

for a discussion of our investment in cameron lng jv jv financing sempra energy guarantees the risks discussed above and other risks relating to the development of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project that could adversely affect our future performance see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “item 1a risk factors” 

proposed cameron liquefaction expansion 

cameron lng jv has received the major permits and fta and nonfta approvals necessary to expand the current configuration of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project from the current three liquefaction trains under construction the proposed expansion project includes up to two additional liquefaction trains and up to two additional full containment lng storage tanks one of which was permitted with the original threetrain project 

expansion of the cameron lng liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the jv project financing agreements including among others timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the project lenders under the cameron lng jv equity agreements the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all the partners including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner discussions among all the cameron lng jv partners have been taking place regarding how an expansion may be structured and we expect that discussions will continue there can be no assurance that a mutually agreeable expansion structure will be agreed upon unanimously by the cameron lng jv members which if not accomplished in a timely manner could materially and adversely impact the development of the expansion project in light of this we are unable to predict whether or when cameron lng jv might be able to move forward on expansion of the cameron lng liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains 

in november 2018 sempra energy and total sa entered into an mou that provides a framework for cooperation for the development of the potential cameron lng expansion project and the potential eca lng jv liquefactionexport project that we describe below in “eca lng jv liquefaction project” the mou contemplates total sa potentially contracting for up to approximately 9 mtpa of lng offtake across these two development projects and provides total sa the option to acquire an equity interest in the proposed eca lng jv project in addition in october 2019 sempra energy and mitsui  co ltd entered into an mou that provides a framework for potential offtake by mitsui  co ltd from the potential cameron lng expansion project and the second phase of the potential eca lng jv project as well as mitsui  co ltd’s potential acquisition of an equity interest in the second phase of the potential eca lng jv project the ultimate participation of total sa and mitsui  co ltd remains subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements among other factors and total sa and mitsui  co ltd have no commitment to participate in the projects 

eca lng jv liquefaction project 

through a jv agreement sempra lng and ienova are developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project at ienova’s existing eca lng regasification terminal the proposed liquefaction facility project which is planned for development in two phases a midscale project referred to as eca lng jv phase 1 and a largescale project referred to as eca lng jv phase 2 is being developed to provide buyers with direct access to west coast lng supplies the eca lng regasification facility currently has profitable longterm regasification contracts for 100 of the regasification facility’s capacity through 2028 making the decisions on whether and how to pursue the eca lng jv phase 2 liquefaction project dependent in part on whether the investment in a largescale liquefaction facility would over the long term be more beneficial financially than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts 

in march 2019 eca lng jv received two authorizations from the doe to export usproduced natural gas to mexico and to reexport lng to nonfta countries from its eca lng jv phase 1 and eca lng jv phase 2 projects in development 

in june 2018 we selected a technipfmc plc and kiewit corporation partnership as the epc contractor for eca lng jv phase 1 subject to reaching a definitive agreement in the coming days we expect to sign a lumpsum turnkey epc contract with technipfmc for the engineering procurement and construction of a onetrain natural gas liquefaction export facility with a nameplate capacity of 325 mtpa and offtake capacity of 25 mtpa if entered into we will have no obligation to move forward on the epc contract and we may release technipfmc to perform portions of the work pursuant to limited notices to proceed we plan to fully release technipfmc to perform all the work to construct eca lng jv phase 1 only after we reach a final investment decision with respect to the project which we expect to make in the first quarter of 2020 and after certain other conditions are met kiewit corporation which we previously expected to be part of the epc contractor jv may be a subcontractor to technipfmc subject to the terms of the epc contract the total price of the epc contract for eca lng jv phase 1 is estimated at approximately 15 billion we estimate that capital expenditures for eca lng jv phase 1 will approximate 19 billion including capitalized interest and project contingency the actual cost of the epc contract and the actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ perhaps substantially from our estimates 

in november 2018 sempra lng and ienova signed heads of agreements with affiliates of total sa mitsui  co ltd and tokyo gas co ltd for eca lng jv phase 1 each heads of agreement for eca lng jv phase 1 contemplates the parties negotiating definitive 20year lng sales and purchase agreements for the purchase of approximately 08 mtpa of lng from the eca lng jv facility but does not obligate the parties to ultimately execute any agreements or participate in the project the ultimate participation of total sa mitsui  co ltd and tokyo gas co ltd in the potential eca lng jv phase 1 project as contemplated by the heads of agreements signed in november 2018 remains subject to finalization of definitive agreements among other factors and none of these parties has committed to participate in this project 

the development of the eca lng jv phase 1 and eca lng jv phase 2 projects is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including obtaining binding customer commitments the receipt of a number of permits and regulatory approvals obtaining financing negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including definitive epc contracts equity acquisition and governance agreements lng sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements reaching a final investment decision and other factors associated with this potential investment in addition as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements an unfavorable decision on certain property disputes and permit challenges could materially and adversely affect the development of these projects for a discussion of these risks see “item 1a risk factors” 

port arthur lng liquefaction project 

sempra lng is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project on a greenfield site that it owns in the vicinity of port arthur texas located along the sabineneches waterway sempra lng received authorizations from the doe in august 2015 and may 2019 that collectively permit the lng to be produced from the proposed port arthur lng project to be exported to all current and future fta and nonfta countries 

in april 2019 the ferc approved the siting construction and operation of the first phase of the proposed port arthur lng liquefaction facility along with certain natural gas pipelines including the louisiana connector pipeline that could be used to supply feed gas to the liquefaction facility assuming the project is completed we expect to make a final investment decision in the third quarter of 2020 

in june 2018 we selected bechtel as the epc contractor for the proposed port arthur lng liquefaction project subject to reaching a definitive agreement we are in the final stages of negotiating and finalizing a definitive epc contract for the project if we execute the epc contract we will have no obligation to move forward on the epc contract and we may release bechtel to perform portions of the work pursuant to limited notices to proceed we plan to fully release bechtel to perform all the work to construct the port arthur lng liquefaction project only after we reach a final investment decision with respect to the project and after certain other conditions are met including project financing the potential epc contract contemplates the construction of two liquefaction trains with a total nameplate capacity of 135 mtpa and a total offtake capacity of approximately 10 mtpa 

in december 2018 polish oil  gas company pgnig and port arthur lng entered into a definitive 20year agreement for the sale and purchase of 2 mtpa of lng per year from the port arthur lng liquefaction project under the agreement lng purchases by pgnig from port arthur lng will be made on a freeonboard basis with pgnig responsible for shipping the lng from the port arthur facility to the final destination port arthur lng will manage the gas pipeline transportation liquefaction processing and cargo loading the agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent including port arthur lng making a positive final investment decision within certain agreed timelines the failure of these conditions precedent to be satisfied or waived within the agreed timelines can result in the termination of the agreement 

in may 2019 aramco services company and sempra lng signed a heads of agreement for the negotiation and finalization of a definitive 20year lng sale and purchase agreement for 5 mtpa of lng offtake the heads of agreement also includes the negotiation and finalization of a 25 equity investment in the project in january 2020 aramco services company and sempra lng signed an interim project participation agreement which sets forth certain mechanisms for the parties to work towards receipt of corporate approvals to enter into and proceed with the transaction execution of the transaction agreements and the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions precedent contemplated by these agreements making a final investment decision and other prefinal investment decision activities the heads of agreement and interim project participation agreement do not obligate the parties to ultimately execute any agreements or participate in the project 

in february 2020 sempra lng filed a ferc application for the siting construction and operation of a second phase at the proposed port arthur lng facility including the potential addition of two liquefaction trains 

in november 2019 port arthur lng commenced the relocation and upgrade of approximately three miles of highway where the port arthur lng liquefaction project would be located 

development of the port arthur lng liquefaction project is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including obtaining additional customer commitments completing the required commercial agreements such as equity acquisitions and governance 

agreements lng sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements completing construction contracts securing all necessary permits and approvals obtaining financing and incentives reaching a final investment decision and other factors associated with the potential investment for a discussion of these risks see “item 1a risk factors” 

discontinued operations 

as we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in january 2019 our board of directors approved a plan to sell our south american businesses in september 2019 we entered into an agreement to sell our equity interests in our peruvian businesses for an aggregate base purchase price of 359 billion subject to customary closing adjustments for working capital and changes in net indebtedness in october 2019 we entered into an agreement to sell our equity interests in our chilean businesses for an aggregate base purchase price of 223 billion subject to customary adjustments for working capital and changes in net indebtedness and other adjustments we expect the sales to close in the first half of 2020 

our utilities in south america have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity we intend to use the proceeds from the sales to focus on capital investment in north america to support additional growth opportunities and strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt we expect the cash provided by earnings from our capital investment will exceed the absence of cash flows from these discontinued operations however there can be no assurance that we will derive these anticipated benefits further there can be no assurance that we will be able to redeploy the capital that we obtain from such sales if completed in a way that would result in cash flows or earnings exceeding those historically generated by these businesses 

sources and uses of cash 

the following tables include only significant changes in cash flow activities for each of our registrants 





  

expenditures for ppe 

we invest the majority of our capital in the california utilities primarily for transmission and distribution improvements including pipeline and wildfire safety the following table summarizes by segment capital expenditures for the last three years 

expenditures for investments and acquisitions 

in 2019 and 2018 we invested heavily in our sempra texas utilities which included our march 2018 acquisition of oncor holdings and subsequent contributions to oncor holdings primarily to fund oncor’s purchase of infrareit in may 2019 the following table summarizes by segment our investments in various jvs as well as business and asset acquisitions 



 

future capital expenditures and investments 

the amounts and timing of capital expenditures and certain investments are generally subject to approvals by various regulatory and other governmental and environmental bodies including the cpuc the ferc and the puct in 2020 we expect to make capital expenditures and investments of approximately 59 billion which excludes capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities as summarized by segment in the following table 



we expect the majority of our capital expenditures and investments in 2020 will relate to transmission and distribution improvements at our regulated public utilities and construction of liquid fuels terminals at sempra mexico 

as we discuss above from 2020 through 2024 and subject to the factors described below which could cause these estimates to vary substantially sempra energy expects to make aggregate capital expenditures and investments of approximately 228 billion which excludes capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities as follows 89 billion at sdge 90 billion at socalgas 07 billion at sempra texas utilities and 19 billion at sempra mexico and 23 billion at sempra lng capital expenditure amounts include capitalized interest and afudc related to debt 

periodically we review our construction investment and financing programs and revise them in response to changes in regulation economic conditions competition customer growth inflation customer rates the cost and availability of capital and safety and environmental requirements 

our level of capital expenditures and investments in the next few years may vary substantially and will depend on among other things the cost and availability of financing regulatory approvals changes in us federal tax law and business opportunities providing desirable rates of return we intend to finance our capital expenditures in a manner that will maintain our investmentgrade credit ratings and capital structure 

capital stock transactions 

sempra energy 

cash provided by issuances of common and preferred stock was 

 dividends 

sempra energy 

sempra energy paid cash dividends of 

 on december 9 2019 sempra energy declared a quarterly dividend of 09675 per share of common stock 150 per share of series a preferred stock and 16875 per share of series b preferred stock all of which were paid on january 15 2020 

dividends declared on common stock have increased in each of the last three years due to an increase in the pershare quarterly dividends approved by our board of directors to 09675 in 2019 387 annually from 0895 in 2018 358 annually and from 08225 in 2017 329 annually 

on february 25 2020 our board of directors approved an increase in sempra energy’s quarterly common stock dividend to 1045 per share 418 annually the first of which is payable april 15 2020 in addition on february 25 2020 our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of 150 per share on our series a preferred stock and 16875 per share on our series b preferred stock both payable on april 15 2020 declarations of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock are made at the discretion of the board of directors while we view dividends as an integral component of shareholder return the amount of future dividends will depend on earnings cash flows financial and legal requirements and other relevant factors at that time 

sdge 

sdge did not declare or pay common stock dividends in 2019 in 2018 and 2017 sdge paid common stock dividends to enova and enova paid corresponding dividends to sempra energy of 250 million and 450 million respectively sdge’s dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for sdge to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program 

in january 2020 sdge declared and paid common stock dividends to enova and enova declared and paid corresponding dividends to sempra energy of 200 million 

enova a wholly owned subsidiary of sempra energy owns all of sdge’s outstanding common stock accordingly dividends paid by sdge to enova and dividends paid by enova to sempra energy are both eliminated in sempra energy’s consolidated financial statements 

socalgas 

in 2019 and 2018 socalgas paid common stock dividends to pe and pe paid corresponding dividends to sempra energy of 150 million and 50 million respectively socalgas did not declare or pay common stock dividends in 2017 socalgas’ dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for socalgas to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program 

pe a wholly owned subsidiary of sempra energy owns all of socalgas’ outstanding common stock accordingly dividends paid by socalgas to pe and dividends paid by pe to sempra energy are both eliminated in sempra energy’s consolidated financial statements 

dividend restrictions 

the board of directors for each of sempra energy sdge and socalgas has the discretion to determine the payment and amount of future dividends by each such entity the cpuc’s regulation of sdge’s and socalgas’ capital structures limits the amounts that are available for loans and dividends to sempra energy at december 31 2019  based on these regulations sempra energy could have received combined loans and dividends of approximately 885 million from sdge and 742 million from socalgas 

we provide additional information about dividend restrictions in “restricted net assets” in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

book value per common share 

sempra energy’s book value per common share on the last day of each year was as follows 

 the increase in 2019 was primarily due to comprehensive income exceeding dividends and issuances of common stock in 2018  the increase was primarily due to issuances of common stock partially offset by dividends exceeding comprehensive income 

capitalization 

our debt to capitalization ratio calculated as total debt as a percentage of total debt and equity was as follows 



significant changes in 2019 that affected capitalization included the following 



commitments 

the following tables summarize undiscounted principal contractual commitments at december 31 2019  exclusive of commitments within discontinued operations for sempra energy consolidated sdge and socalgas we provide additional information about commitments above and in notes 1 7  9  15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 







 

 

the tables exclude contracts between consolidated affiliates intercompany debt and employment contracts 

the tables also exclude income tax liabilities at december 31 2019 of 

 these liabilities relate to uncertain tax positions and were excluded from the tables because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of future payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions we provide additional information about unrecognized income tax benefits in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have bilateral unsecured standby letter of credit capacity with select lenders that is uncommitted and supported by reimbursement agreements at december 31 2019  we had approximately 647 million in standby letters of credit outstanding under these agreements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2019  sempra lng has provided guarantees aggregating a maximum of 40 billion associated with cameron lng jv’s debt obligations we discuss these guarantees in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sdge has entered into ppas that are variable interests our investments in oncor holdings and cameron lng jv are variable interests sempra energy’s other businesses may also enter into arrangements that could include variable interests we discuss variable interests in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

management views certain accounting policies as critical because their application is the most relevant judgmental andor material to our financial position and results of operations andor because they require the use of material judgments and estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss choices among alternative accounting policies that are material to our financial statements and information concerning significant estimates with the audit committee of the sempra energy board of directors 

contingencies 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

we accrue losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes for loss contingencies we accrue the loss if an event has occurred on or before the balance sheet date and   

 we do not accrue contingencies that might result in gains we continuously assess contingencies for litigation claims environmental remediation and other events 

details of our issues in this area are discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

regulatory accounting 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

as regulated entities the california utilities’ rates as set and monitored by regulators are designed to recover the cost of providing service and provide the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investments the california utilities record regulatory assets which are generally costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that through the ratemaking process the utility will recover that asset from customers in future rates similarly regulatory liabilities are recorded for amounts recovered in rates in advance or in excess of costs incurred the california utilities assess probabilities of future rate recovery associated with regulatory account balances at the end of each reporting period and whenever new andor unusual events occur such as 

 to the extent that circumstances associated with regulatory balances change the regulatory balances are evaluated and adjusted if appropriate 

adverse legislative or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of our regulatory assets and liabilities and could materially adversely impact our financial statements details of the california utilities’ regulatory assets and liabilities and additional factors that management considers when assessing probabilities associated with regulatory balances are discussed in notes 1  4  15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management judgments and estimates amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as well as current and noncurrent accruals involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities when we evaluate the anticipated resolution of income tax issues we consider 

 the likelihood of deferred income tax recovery is based on analyses of the deferred income tax assets and our expectation of future taxable income based on our strategic planning 

actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts because of   

 for an uncertain position to qualify for benefit recognition the position must have at least a morelikelythannot chance of being sustained based on the position’s technical merits upon challenge by the respective authorities the term morelikelythannot means a likelihood of more than 50 if we do not have a morelikelythannot position with respect to a tax position then we do not recognize any of the potential tax benefit associated with the position a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon the effective resolution of the tax position 

unrecognized tax benefits involve management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of the benefit being sustained the final resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in adjustments to recorded amounts and may affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we discuss details of our issues in this area and additional information related to accounting for income taxes including uncertainty in income taxes in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

derivatives and hedge accounting 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

we record derivative instruments for which we do not apply a scope exception at fair value on the balance sheet depending on the purpose for the contract and the applicability of hedge or regulatory accounting the changes in fair value of derivatives may be recorded in earnings on the balance sheet or in oci we also use the normal purchase or sale exception for certain derivative contracts whenever possible we use exchange quoted prices or other thirdparty pricing to estimate fair values if no such data is available we use internally developed models and other techniques  the assumed collectability of derivative assets considers events specific to a given counterparty the counterparty’s credit worthiness and the tenor of the transaction 

the application of hedge accounting and normal purchase or sale accounting for certain derivatives is determined on a contractbycontract basis significant changes in assumptions in our cash flow hedges such as the amount andor timing of forecasted transactions could cause unrealized gains or losses marktomarket to be reclassified out of aoci to earnings which may materially impact our results of operations additionally changes in assumed physical delivery on contracts for which we elected normal purchase or sale accounting may result in “tainting” of the election which may 1 preclude us from making this election in future transactions and 2 impact sempra energy’s results of operations any resulting impact on the california utilities’ results of operations would not be significant because regulatory accounting principles generally apply to their contracts we provide details of our derivative instruments and our fair value approaches in notes 11 and 12  respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

to measure our pension and other postretirement obligations costs and liabilities we rely on several assumptions we consider current market conditions including interest rates in making these assumptions we review these assumptions annually and update when appropriate   

the critical assumptions used to develop the required estimates include the following key factors   

 the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to   

 these differences other than those related to the california utilities’ plans where rate recovery offsets the effects of the assumptions on earnings may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense we record for plans other than those at the california utilities the approximate annual effect on earnings of a 100 bps increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would be less than 2 million and the effect of a 100 bps increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would be less than 2 million we provide details of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

asset retirement obligations 

sempra energy sdge 

sdge’s legal aros related to the decommissioning of songs are estimated based on a sitespecific study performed no less than every three years the estimate of the obligations includes   

 changes in the estimated decommissioning costs or in the assumptions and judgments made by management underlying these estimates could cause revisions to the estimated total cost associated with retiring the assets sdge’s nuclear decommissioning expenses are subject to rate recovery and therefore ratemaking accounting treatment is applied to sdge’s nuclear decommissioning activities sdge recognizes a regulatory asset or liability to the extent that its songs aro exceeds or is less than the amount collected from customers and the amount earned in sdge’s ndt 

we provide additional detail in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment testing of longlived assets 

sempra energy 

whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable we consider if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset if so we estimate the fair value of the asset to determine the extent to which carrying value exceeds fair value for such an estimate we may consider data from multiple valuation methods including data from market participants we exercise judgment to estimate the future cash flows and the useful life of a longlived asset and to determine our intent to use the asset our intent to use or dispose of a longlived asset is subject to reevaluation and can change over time 

if an impairment test is required the fair value of a longlived asset can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions we discuss impairment of longlived assets in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

impairment testing of goodwill 

sempra energy 

on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation we consider whether goodwill may be impaired for our annual goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test if we elect to perform the qualitative assessment we evaluate relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors changes in key personnel and the overall financial performance of the reporting unit if after assessing these qualitative factors we determine that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the twostep goodwill impairment test under the twostep goodwill impairment test we first determine if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value and if so then measure the amount of goodwill impairment if any when determining if goodwill is impaired the fair value of the reporting unit and goodwill can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions as a result recognizing a goodwill impairment may or may not be required when we perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we exercise judgment to develop estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to its carrying value our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant we consider observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments if available as well as an incomebased approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis a discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future revenues and expenses and may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the reporting unit critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include 

 in 2019 we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units in mexico to which goodwill was allocated was substantially above their carrying values as of october 1 2019 our goodwill impairment testing date we discuss goodwill in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

carrying value of equity method investments 

sempra energy 

we generally account for investments under the equity method when we have significant influence over but do not have control of the investee 

we consider whether the fair value of each equity investment as a whole not the underlying net assets has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary to help evaluate whether a decline in fair value below carrying value has occurred and if the decline is other than temporary we may develop fair value estimates for the investment our fair value estimates are developed 

from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant in the absence of observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments we consider an incomebased approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis or with less weighting the replacement cost of the underlying net assets a discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future distributions from the investment or may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the entity and adjusted for our ownership share total when calculating estimates of fair value we also consider whether we intend to hold or sell the investment for certain investments critical assumptions may include 

 in addition for our indirect investment in oncor critical assumptions may also include the effects of ratemaking such as the results of regulator decisions on rates and recovery of regulated investments and costs the risk assumptions applied by other market participants to value the investments could vary significantly or the appropriate approaches could be weighted differently these differences could impact whether or not the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value and if so whether that condition is other than temporary this could result in an impairment charge and in cases where an impairment charge has been recorded additional loss or gain upon sale in the case of a sale transaction 

we provide additional details in notes 6 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards 

we discuss the relevant pronouncements that have recently become effective and have had or may have a significant effect on our financial statements in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of erosion of our cash flows earnings asset values and equity due to adverse changes in market prices interest rates and foreign currency rates 

risk policies 

sempra energy has policies governing its market risk management and trading activities sempra energy and the california utilities maintain separate risk management committees organizations and processes for the california utilities and for all noncpuc regulated affiliates to provide oversight of these activities the committees consist of senior officers who establish policy oversee energy risk management activities and monitor the results of trading and other activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies these activities include but are not limited to monitoring of market positions that create credit liquidity and market risk the respective oversight organizations and committees are independent from the energy procurement departments 

along with other tools we use var and liquidity metrics to measure our exposure to market risk associated with the commodity portfolios var is an estimate of the potential loss on a position or portfolio of positions over a specified holding period based on normal market conditions and within a given statistical confidence interval we use a variancecovariance var model at a 95 confidence level a liquidity metric is intended to monitor the amount of financial resources needed for meeting potential margin calls as forward market prices move var and liquidity risk metrics are calculated independently by the respective risk management oversight organizations 

the california utilities use power and natural gas derivatives to manage natural gas and electric price risk associated with servicing load requirements the use of power and natural gas derivatives is subject to certain limitations imposed by company policy and is in compliance with risk management and trading activity plans that have been filed with and approved by the cpuc we discuss revenue recognition in note 3 and the additional marketrisk information regarding derivative instruments in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have exposure to changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency rates the following discussion of these primary marketrisk exposures as of december 31 2019 includes a discussion of how these exposures are managed 

commodity price risk 

market risk related to physical commodities is created by volatility in the prices and basis of certain commodities our various subsidiaries are exposed in varying degrees to price risk primarily to prices in the natural gas and electricity markets our policy is to manage this risk within a framework that considers the unique markets and operating and regulatory environments of each subsidiary 

sempra mexico and sempra lng are generally exposed to commodity price risk indirectly through their lng natural gas pipelines and storage and powergenerating assets these segments may utilize commodity transactions in the course of optimizing these assets these transactions are typically priced based on market indices but may also include fixed price purchases and sales of commodities any residual exposure is monitored as described above a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in commodity prices would not have resulted in a material change in the fair value of our commoditybased derivatives for these segments at december 31 2019 and 2018  the impact of a change in energy commodity prices on our commoditybased derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled and does not typically include the generally offsetting impact of our underlying asset positions 

the california utilities’ marketrisk exposure is limited due to cpucauthorized rate recovery of the costs of commodity purchases interstate and intrastate transportation and storage activity however socalgas may at times be exposed to market risk as a result of incentive mechanisms that reward or penalize the utility for commodity costs below or above certain benchmarks for socalgas’ gcim if commodity prices were to rise too rapidly it is likely that volumes would decline this decline would increase the perunit fixed costs which could lead to further volume declines the california utilities manage their risk within the parameters of their market risk management framework as of and for the year ended december 31 2019  the total var of the california utilities’ natural gas and electric positions was not material and the procurement activities were in compliance with the procurement plans filed with and approved by the cpuc 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily as a result of our having issued short and longterm debt subject to regulatory constraints we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to moderate our exposure to interest rate changes and to lower our overall cost of borrowing 

the table below shows the nominal amount of debt 



 

interest rate risk sensitivity analysis measures interest rate risk by calculating the estimated changes in earnings that would result from a hypothetical change in market interest rates earnings are affected by changes in interest rates on shortterm debt and variable longterm debt if weightedaverage interest rates on shortterm debt outstanding at december 31 2019 increased or decreased by 10 the change in earnings over the 12month period ended december 31 2020 would be approximately 8 million  if interest rates increased or decreased by 10 on all variablerate longterm debt at december 31 2019  after 

considering the effects of interest rate swaps the change in earnings over the 12month period ended december 31 2020 would be approximately 1 million  

we provide further information about debt and interest rate swap transactions in notes 7 and 11 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we also are subject to the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the assets of our pension plans other postretirement benefit plans and sdge’s ndt however we expect the effects of these fluctuations as they relate to the california utilities to be recovered in future rates 

foreign currency and inflation rate risk 

we discuss the impact of foreign currency and inflation rates in “item 7 mda – impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations” 

the hypothetical effect for every 10 appreciation in the us dollar against the mexican peso in which we have operations and investments are as follows 



 

monetary assets and liabilities at our mexican subsidiaries that are denominated in us dollars may fluctuate significantly throughout the year these monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes based on a net monetary liability position of 40 billion  including those related to our investments in jvs at december 31 2019  the hypothetical effect of a 10 increase in the mexican inflation rate is approximately 77 million lower earnings as a result of higher income tax expense for our consolidated subsidiaries as well as lower equity earnings for our jvs 






 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 






 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas have designed and maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in their respective reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and is accumulated and communicated to the management of each company including each respective principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating these controls and procedures the management of each company recognizes that any system of controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives therefore the management of each company applies judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of other possible controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of management including the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of sempra energy sdge and socalgas each company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2019  the end of the period covered by this report based on these evaluations the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of sempra energy sdge and socalgas concluded that their respective company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

our segments 

we provide financial information about our reportable segments in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of sempra energy’s consolidated revenues in 2018 2017 or 2016 

sdge 

sdge is a regulated public utility that provides electric services to a population of approximately 37 million and natural gas services to approximately 34 million of that population covering a 4100 square mile service territory in southern california that encompasses san diego county and an adjacent portion of southern orange county 

electric utility operations 

customers and demand sdge provides electric services through the generation transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes 



 

no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of sdge’s revenues from electricity sold in 2018 2017 or 2016 

san diego’s mild climate and sdge’s robust energy efficiency programs contribute to lower consumption by our customers rooftop solar installations continue to reduce residential and commercial volumes sold by sdge as of december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 the residential and commercial rooftop solar capacity in sdge’s territory totaled 1023 mw 836 mw and 694 mw respectively we discuss electric rate reform and the nem program in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” 

demand for electricity is dependent on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products consumer preference environmental regulations legislation renewable power generation the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs demandside management goals and distributed generation resources california’s energy policy supports increased electrification particularly electrification of vehicles which could result in significant increases in sales volumes in the coming years other external factors such as the price of purchased power the use of hydroelectric power the use of and further development of renewable energy resources and energy storage development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in the market price of electricity which may in turn impact demand demand for electricity is also impacted by seasonal weather patterns or “seasonality” tending to increase in the summer months to meet cooling load and in the winter months to meet heating load 

electric resources to meet customer demand sdge procures power from its own electric generation facilities and from other suppliers through cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts or through purchases on a spot basis sdge’s supply as of december 31 2018 is as follows 



 

sdge is required to interconnect with and purchase power from qfs a class of generating facilities established by the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 at rates that do not exceed sdge’s avoided cost for sdge qfs include cogeneration facilities which produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy such as heat or steam used for industrial commercial residential or institutional purposes charges under most of the contracts with qfs are based on what it would incrementally cost sdge to produce the power or procure it from other sources charges under the contracts with other suppliers are for firm and asgenerated energy and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity tolling contracts are purchasedpower contracts under which sdge provides natural gas for generation to the energy supplier the prices under these contracts include 193 mw at prices that are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated 

sdge provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a longterm basis as shown above while sdge provides such procurement service for the majority of its customer load customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than sdge through programs such as da and cca da is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours utility customers can also receive procurement through cca if the customer’s local jurisdiction city offers such a program several local political jurisdictions including the city of san diego and other municipalities are considering implementing or are implementing a cca which could result in the departure of more than half of sdge’s bundled load when customers are served by another load serving entity sdge no longer serves this departing load and the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources could then be borne by its remaining bundled procurement customers to help achieve the goal of ratepayer indifference whether or not customers join ccas the cpuc revised the pcia framework by adopting several refinements which sdge implemented on january 1 2019 we discuss pcia da and cca further in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance – sdge – potential impacts of community choice aggregation and direct access” 

natural gas supply for generation facilities sdge procures natural gas under shortterm contracts for its owned generation facilities and for certain tolling contracts associated with purchasedpower arrangements purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

power pool sdge is a participant in the western systems power pool which includes an electricpower and transmissionrate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities power agencies energy brokers and power marketers located throughout the us and canada participants can make power transactions on standardized terms including marketbased rates preapproved by the ferc participation in the western systems power pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk 

electric transmission and distribution system service to sdge’s customers is supported by its electric transmission and distribution system at december 31 2018 sdge’s electric transmission and distribution facilities included substations and overhead and underground lines these electric facilities are in san diego imperial and orange counties of california and in 

arizona and nevada the facilities consist of 2089 miles of transmission lines 23591 miles of distribution lines and 161 substations periodically various areas of the service territory require expansion to accommodate customer growth reliability and safety 

sdge’s 500kv southwest powerlink transmission line which is shared with arizona public service company and imperial irrigation district extends from palo verde arizona to san diego california sdge’s share of the line is 1162 mw although it can be less under certain system conditions sdge’s sunrise powerlink is a 500kv transmission line constructed and operated by sdge with import capability of 1000 mw of power 

mexico’s baja california transmission system is connected to sdge’s system via two 230kv interconnections with combined capacity of up to 408 mw in the northtosouth direction and 800 mw in the southtonorth direction although it can be less under certain system conditions 

edison’s transmission system is connected to sdge’s system via five 230kv transmission lines 

competition sdge faces competition to serve its customer load from the growth in distributed and local power generation including rooftop solar installations and battery storage and the corresponding decrease in demand for power delivered through sdge’s electric transmission and distribution system and from departing retail load from customers transferring to load serving entities other than sdge through programs such as da and cca sdge does not earn any return on commodity sales volumes 

natural gas utility operations 

we discuss sdge’s natural gas utility operations below in “california utilities’ natural gas utility operations” 

key noncash performance indicators 

we use certain financial and nonfinancial metrics to measure how effective our businesses are in achieving their key business objectives for sdge these key noncash performance indicators include number of customers electricity sold system average rate and natural gas volumes transported and sold additional noncash performance indicators include goals related to safety including activities designed to help reduce the risk of wildfires customer service company reputation environmental considerations including quantities of renewable energy purchases ontime and onbudget completion of major projects and initiatives and service reliability 

socalgas 

socalgas is a regulated public utility that owns and operates a natural gas distribution transmission and storage system that supplies natural gas to a population of approximately 219 million covering a 24000 square mile service territory that encompasses southern california and portions of central california excluding san diego county the city of long beach and the desert area of san bernardino county

we provide additional information on socalgas’ natural gas utility operations below in “california utilities’ natural gas utility operations” 

key noncash performance indicators 

key noncash performance indicators for socalgas include number of customers and natural gas volumes transported and sold additional noncash performance indicators include goals related to safety customer service company reputation environmental considerations natural gas demand by customer segment ontime and onbudget completion of major projects and initiatives and service reliability 

california utilities ’ natural gas utility operations 

customers and demand 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers and sdge’s core customers on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others 





 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the california utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers a substantial portion of socalgas’ revenues are from core customers 

noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial and industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers a portion of socalgas’ noncore customers are nonendusers socalgas’ nonendusers include wholesale customers consisting primarily of other ious including sdge or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers 

noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements as the regulatory framework does not allow us to recover the actual cost of natural gas procured and delivered to noncore customers 

no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of socalgas’ or sdge’s revenues from natural gas operations in 2018 2017 or 2016 

demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products consumer preference environmental regulations legislation california’s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs other external factors such as weather the price of electricity the use of hydroelectric power the use of and further development of renewable energy resources and energy storage development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas outside the state of california and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price which may in turn impact demand 

one of the larger sources for natural gas demand is electric generation natural gasfired electric generation within southern california and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity growth in selfgeneration from rooftop solar the addition of more efficient gas technologies new energy efficiency initiatives and the extent that regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the california utilities’ respective service areas the demand for natural gas may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to climate change weather conditions and other impacts and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources given the significant quantity of natural gasfired generation natural gas is the dispatchable fuel of choice to help ensure electric reliability in our california service territories 

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and cash provided from operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry but subject to current regulatory limitations socalgas usually injects natural gas into storage during the summer months april through october which reduces cash provided by operating activities during this period and usually withdraws natural gas from storage during the winter months november through march which increases cash provided by operating activities when customer demand is higher 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

at december 31 2018 socalgas’ natural gas facilities include 3062 miles of transmission and storage pipelines 50863 miles of distribution pipelines 48202 miles of service pipelines and nine transmission compressor stations while sdge’s natural gas facilities consist of 168 miles of transmission pipelines 8966 miles of distribution pipelines 6562 miles of service pipelines and one compressor station 

socalgas purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the california utilities’ residential and smaller business customers socalgas purchases natural gas from various sources including from canada the us rockies and the southwestern regions of the us purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

to help ensure the delivery of natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights energy companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california 

natural gas storage 

socalgas owns four natural gas storage facilities these facilities have a combined working gas capacity of 137 bcf and have over 200 injection withdrawal and observation wells that provide natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers socalgas’ and sdge’s core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas’ storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others including sdge for its noncore customer requirements natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for ensuring service reliability during peak demand periods including heating needs in the winter as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility represents 63 percent of socalgas’ natural gas storage capacity socalgas discovered a natural gas leak at one of its wells at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in october 2015 and permanently sealed the well in february 2016 socalgas was subsequently authorized to make limited withdrawals and injections of natural gas at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and as of july 2018 has been directed by the cpuc to maintain up to 34 bcf of working gas to help achieve reliability for the region at reasonable rates as determined by the cpuc we discuss the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility leak in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

sempra texas utility 

sempra texas utility is comprised of our equity method investment in oncor holdings which we acquired in march 2018 we discuss the acquisition in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements oncor holdings is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of sempra texas intermediate holding company llc and owns an 8025 percent interest in oncor tti owns the remaining 1975 percent interest in oncor oncor is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the state of delaware 

certain ringfencing measures existing governance mechanisms and commitments which we describe in “item 1a risk factors” remain in effect following the merger and are intended to enhance oncor holdings’ and oncor’s separateness from their owners and to mitigate the risk that these entities would be negatively impacted by the bankruptcy of or other adverse financial developments affecting their owners sempra energy does not control oncor holdings or oncor and the ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to direct the management policies and operations of oncor holdings and oncor including the deployment or disposition of their assets declarations of dividends strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions these limitations include limited representation on the oncor holdings and oncor boards of directors as oncor holdings and oncor will continue to have a majority of independent directors thus oncor holdings and oncor will continue to be managed independently ie ringfenced as such we account for our 100percent ownership interest in oncor holdings as an equity method investment see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our equity method investment in oncor holdings

distribution revenues from residential and small business users are based on actual monthly consumption kwh and depending on size and annual load factor revenues from large commercial and industrial users are based either on actual monthly demand kw or the greater of actual monthly demand kw or 80 percent of peak monthly demand during the prior eleven months 

competition oncor operates in certificated areas designated by the puct the majority of oncor’s service territory is single certificated with oncor as the only certificated transmission and distribution provider however in multicertificated areas of texas oncor competes with certain utilities and rural electric cooperatives for the right to serve enduse customers 

sempra south american utilities 

sempra south american utilities develops owns and operates or holds interests in electric transmission distribution and generation infrastructure through its two utilities chilquinta energía in chile and luz del sur in peru it also owns interests in two energyservices companies tecnored and tecsur that provide electric construction and infrastructure services to chilquinta energía and luz del sur respectively as well as third parties tecnored also sells electricity to nonregulated customers 

on january 25 2019 our board of directors approved a plan to sell our south american businesses we expect to complete the sales process by the end of 2019 

chilquinta energía sa 

chilquinta energía an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of sempra energy is an electric distribution utility serving a population of approximately 18 million in the region of valparaíso in central chile and approximately 130000 in the communities of parral and linares in the southcentral region of maule with a combined service area covering approximately 4100 square miles in december 2018 chilquinta energía acquired ctng which owns regulated transmission assets as we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements chilquinta energía is the third largest electricity distribution company in chile with an approximate 9percent share of the market 

customers and demand chilquinta energía provides electric services through the transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes 



in chile customers are classified as regulated or nonregulated based on installed capacity regulated customers are those whose installed capacity is less than 500 kw nonregulated customers are those whose installed capacity is greater than 5000 kw customers with installed capacity between 500 kw and 5000 kw may choose to be classified as regulated or nonregulated nonregulated customers that can buy power from other sources such as directly from the generator are classified as tolling customers both regulated and nonregulated customers pay transmission and distribution tariffs for the transportation of their electricity through the system there is no risk of stranded costs for chilquinta energía because ppas with generators are not takeorpay contracts rather chilquinta energía only purchases power taken by its customers 

demand for electricity depends on the growth and stability of the chilean economy customer growth and preferences price of electricity policies and environmental regulations driving the substitution of alternative energy products for wood and coal legislation and energy policy supporting increased electrification of the public and private transportation sector and the roll out and expansion of energy efficiency programs and distributed generation resources 

the price of electricity can be affected by the growth of renewable power generation the amount of hydroelectric power the market price of oil and natural gas and transmission and distribution service tariffs 

other factors that can affect the demand for electricity include weather and seasonality demand for electricity at chilquinta energía is higher in the winter months to meet heating load and tends to decrease during the mild temperatures in the summer months 

electric resources the supply of electric power available to chilquinta energía comes from purchasedpower contracts currently in place with various suppliers the supply as of december 31 2018 was as follows 

1 contracts with fuel sources that include natural gas coal or diesel are collectively referred to as thermal 

power generation system the national electric system is operated and coordinated by the national electric coordinator coordinador eléctrico nacional this institution is managed by a directive council consejo directivo formed by five members designated through a public tender this entity coordinates the operation of the nationwide interconnected electric system 

transmission system and access at december 31 2018 chilquinta energía’s electric facilities include 10360 miles of distribution lines 548 miles of transmission lines and 53 substations chilquinta energía also owns a 50percent interest in eletrans which operates a 97mile 220kv double circuit transmission line in the atacama region of northern chile and a 46mile 220kv double circuit transmission line in the los rios region of southern chile 

transmission lines in chile are either part of the main transmission system the national system or the subtransmission system the zonal system subtransmission systems including those owned by chilquinta energía are comprised of infrastructure that is interconnected to the electricity system to supply nonregulated and regulated endusers located in the distribution service area 

we discuss ongoing transmission line projects at chilquinta energía’s jvs in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” 

competition chilquinta energía faces limited competition from the growth in rooftop solar installations as electricity prices remain competitive and tariffs compensate selfgenerators only for the commodity component of the energy delivered to the grid presently there are no public programs or incentives promoting the adoption of distributed energy generation 

in addition the national electric coordinator will be tendering a significant number of projects divided between extension work and new development work for subtransmission systems the new development projects in these tenders will be opened to independent developers allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for their construction and operation 

luz del sur saa 

sempra energy indirectly owns 836 percent of luz del sur an electric distribution utility that serves a population of approximately 49 million in the southern zone of metropolitan lima peru with a service area covering approximately 1400 square miles luz del sur delivers approximately 30 percent of all power used in peru the remaining shares of luz del sur are held by nci and trade on the lima stock exchange bolsa de valores de lima under the symbol lusurc1 the shares are subject to regulation by the superintendencia del mercado de valores superintendency of securities market 

customers and demand luz del sur provides electric services through the generation transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes 



in peru customers are classified as regulated or nonregulated based on capacity demand regulated customers are those whose capacity demand is less than 200 kw and their energy supply is considered public service nonregulated customers which are free and tolling customers are those whose capacity demand is greater than 2500 kw customers with capacity demand between 200 kw and 2500 kw may choose to be classified as regulated or nonregulated free customers purchase power directly from a utility and pay the utility a fee for generation transmission primary and secondary and distribution services tolling customers purchase power from alternate suppliers and pay only a tolling fee to the utility for secondary transmission and distribution services utilities in peru including luz del sur generally have ppas with generators to serve their regulated and free customers’ load because the power purchased by luz del sur from generators is generally based on takeorpay contracts luz del sur is exposed to the risk of stranded costs associated with capacity charges as we discuss in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” 

demand for electricity depends on the stability and growth of the peruvian economy customer growth and usage preferences electricity prices legislation and energy policy supporting increased electrification within our service territory the price of electricity can be affected by changes in energy policy volatility of spot market prices the amount of hydroelectric power the market price of oil and natural gas changes in inflation and foreign exchange rates new technologies and transmission and distribution service tariffs which may also impact demand for electricity other factors that can affect the demand for electricity include weather and seasonality demand for electricity at luz del sur is higher in the summer months to meet cooling load and tends to decrease during the colder temperatures in the winter months 

electric resources the supply of electric power available to luz del sur comes from purchasedpower contracts currently in place with various suppliers its own electric generation facility or purchases made on an asneeded basis this supply as of december 31 2018 was as follows 



 based on guidelines established by the system operator in peru and historical water flows available excess 

capacity is sold in the spot market 

 

power generation system the sistema eléctrico interconectado nacional sein is the peruvian national interconnected system the osinergmin in addition to setting tariffs supervises the bidding processes for energy purchases between distribution companies and generators 

the committee of economic operation of the national interconnected system comité de operación económica del sistema interconectado nacional coordinates the operation and dispatch of electricity of the sein 

transmission system and access at december 31 2018 luz del sur’s electric facilities consisted of 14323 miles of distribution lines 232 miles of transmission lines and 44 substations luz del sur also owns and operates santa teresa a 100mw hydroelectric power plant located in the cusco region of peru 

transmission lines in peru are divided into principal and secondary systems the principal system lines are accessible by all generators and allow the flow of energy through the national grid the secondary system lines connect principal transmission with the network of distribution companies or connect directly to certain final customers the transmission company receives tariff revenues and collects tolls based on a charge per unit of electricity 

we discuss ongoing transmission line and substation projects at luz del sur in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” 

competition while electric distribution companies in peru are considered natural monopolies users consuming more than 200 kw are free to choose the company of their preference including luz del sur to provide them with electric power 

key noncash performance indicators 

key noncash performance indicators for our south american electric distribution utilities’ operations are customer count and consumption and transmission line losses additional noncash performance indicators include goals related to safety environmental considerations electric reliability and regulatory compliance 

sempra mexico 

our sempra mexico segment includes the operating companies of our subsidiary ienova as well as certain holding companies and risk management activity ienova develops builds and operates energy infrastructure in mexico in two key energy markets gas and power ienova’s gas business offers pipeline services for natural gas lpg and ethane as well as storage for lng and lpg and distribution of natural gas currently ienova is constructing four marine terminals for the receipt storage and delivery of hydrocarbons in addition to two land terminals in its power business ienova operates a naturalgasfired combinedcycle plant and two wind power generation facilities and is constructing four new solar power generation facilities in addition to the expansion of its energía sierra juárez wind power generation facility 

sempra energy owns 665 percent of ienova as of december 31 2018  with the remaining shares held by nci and traded on the mexican stock exchange under the symbol ienova the mexican national banking and securities commission comisión nacional bancaria y de valores or cnbv regulates the shares which are registered with the mexican national securities registry registro nacional de valores maintained by the cnbv we discuss ienova’s nci and its acquisition and divestiture activities in notes 1 and 5  respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the following discussions provide information about sempra mexico’s businesses that were operational as of december 31 2018  see “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” for information about projects in development or under construction 

gas business 

pipelines and related assetsfacilities at december 31 2018  sempra mexico’s assetsfacilities consisted of 1353 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines 12 compressor stations 139 miles of ethane pipelines 118 miles of lpg pipelines and one lpg storage terminal in mexico these assets are contracted under longterm us dollarbased agreements with major industry participants such as the cfe cenagas pemex shell gazprom saavi energy solutions llc and other similar counterparties 

in 2018  our pipeline assets in mexico had design capacity of approximately 13901 mmcf per day of natural gas 204 mmcf per day of ethane gas 106000 barrels per day of ethane liquid 34000 barrels per day of lpg transmission and 80000 barrels of lpg storage 

lng sempra mexico operates its eca lng regasification terminal on land it owns in baja california mexico the eca lng regasification terminal is capable of processing 1 bcf of natural gas per day and generates revenues from reservation and usage fees under terminal capacity agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with shell and gazprom expiring in 2028 that permit them together to use onehalf of the terminal’s capacity 

in connection with sempra lng  midstream’s lng purchase agreement with tangguh psc sempra mexico purchases from sempra lng  midstream the lng delivered to eca by tangguh psc sempra mexico uses the natural gas produced from this lng and natural gas purchased in the market or through sempra lng  midstream’s marketing operations to supply a contract for the sale of natural gas to mexico’s national electric company the cfe at prices that are based on the socal border index if lng volumes received from tangguh psc are not sufficient to satisfy the commitment to the cfe sempra mexico may purchase natural gas from sempra lng  midstream’s natural gas marketing operations 

sempra lng  midstream has an agreement with sempra mexico to supply lng to the eca lng terminal although the lng purchase agreement specifies a number of cargoes to be delivered annually actual cargoes delivered have been significantly lower than the maximum specified under the agreement as a result sempra lng  midstream is contractually required to make monthly indemnity payments to sempra mexico for failure to deliver the contracted lng 

the lng regasification business is impacted by worldwide lng market prices high lng prices in markets outside the market in which ienova’s lng terminal operates have resulted and could continue to result in lower than expected deliveries of lng cargoes to the eca lng terminal from third parties under existing supply agreements which could increase costs if ienova is instead required to obtain lng in the open market at prevailing prices any inability to obtain expected lng cargoes could also impact ienova’s ability to maintain the minimum level of lng required to keep the eca lng terminal in operation at the proper temperature prices in international lng markets through which ienova must purchase natural gas to meet its contractual obligations to deliver natural gas to customers may also affect ienova’s lng marketing operations which could have an adverse impact on its earnings but may be mitigated in part by the indemnity payments discussed above 

sempra mexico’s lng marketing operations sell natural gas to the cfe and other customers under supply agreements sempra mexico recognizes the revenue from the sale of natural gas upon transfer of the natural gas via pipelines to the customers at the agreed upon delivery points and in the case of the cfe at its thermoelectric power plants 

natural gas distribution sempra mexico’s natural gas distribution regulated utility ecogas operates in three separate distribution zones in mexico with approximately 2453 miles of pipeline and had approximately 123000 customer meters serving more than 400000 residential commercial and industrial consumers with sales volume of approximately 18 mmcf per day in 2018  

ecogas relies on affiliates sempra lng  midstream and socalgas for the supply and transportation of natural gas that it distributes to its customers if these affiliates fail to perform and ecogas is unable to obtain supplies of natural gas from alternate sources ecogas could lose customers and sales volume and could also be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility 

ecogas faces competition from other distributors of natural gas in each of its three distribution zones in mexicali chihuahua and la lagunadurango as other distributors of natural gas build or consider building natural gas distribution systems and compete with ecogas for customers 

power business 

wind power generation sempra mexico develops invests in and operates renewable energy generation facilities that have longterm ppas to sell the electricity they generate to its customers which are generally load serving entities as well as industrial and other customers load serving entities sell electric service to their endusers and wholesale customers immediately upon receipt of our power delivery while industrial and other customers consume the electricity to run their facilities  in 2018  sempra mexico had contracted capacity of 407 mw for its ownership share of fully operating wind energy generation facilities 

natural gasfired generation tdm is a 625mw natural gasfired power plant located in mexicali baja california mexico that generates revenue from selling electricity andor resource adequacy to the california iso and to governmental public utility and wholesale power marketing entities it also has an ema with sempra lng  midstream for energy marketing scheduling and other related services to support its sales of generated power into the california electricity market under the ema tdm pays fees to sempra lng  midstream for these revenuegenerating services tdm also purchases fuel from sempra lng  midstream sempra mexico records revenue for the sale of power generated by tdm and records cost of sales for the purchases of natural gas and energy management services provided by sempra lng  midstream 

tdm competes daily with other generating plants that supply power into the california electricity market several of the wholesale markets supplied by merchant power plants have experienced significant pricing declines due to excess supply ienova manages commodity price risk at tdm by optimizing a mix of forward onpeak energy sales daily and hourly spot market sales of capacity energy and ancillary services and longerterm structured transactions as well as avoiding short positions 

demand and competition 

the overall demand for natural gas distribution services increases during the winter months conversely in the power business the overall demand for electricity is greater during the summer months 

ienova competes with mexican and foreign companies for certain new energy infrastructure projects in mexico some of its competitors including but not limited to public or stateoperated companies their subsidiaries and affiliates may have better access to capital and greater financial and other resources which could give them a competitive advantage in bidding for such projects 

sempra mexico’s pipeline and storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated pipelines and storage facilities they compete primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets 

sempra mexico’s gas business competitors include among others 

generation from sempra mexico’s renewable energy assets is susceptible to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind and inclement weather because sempra mexico sells power that it generates at its energía sierra juárez wind power 

generation facility into california sempra mexico’s future performance and the demand for renewable energy may be impacted by us state mandated requirements to deliver a portion of total energy load from renewable energy sources the rules governing these requirements in california are generally known as the rps program in california certification of a generation project by the cec as an err allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements if such purchase meets the provisions of sb x12 the rps program may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by sempra mexico particularly the demand from california’s utilities we expect to receive err certification for all our sempra mexico renewable facilities providing power to california as they become operational 

sempra mexico’s power business competitors include among others

on june 25 2018 our board of directors approved a plan to divest all our nonutility us wind and us solar assets on december 13 2018 sempra renewables completed the sale of its solar assets solar and battery storage development projects as well as its ownership interest in one wind facility to a subsidiary of con ed for 16 billion in february 2019 sempra renewables entered into an agreement with american electric power to sell its remaining wind assets and investments for 551 million subject to working capital adjustments and customary closing conditions we expect to complete the sale in the second quarter of 2019 we provide further information related to these sales in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

certain of sempra renewables’ wind power facilities and certain solar power facilities that were sold to a subsidiary of con ed are held by limited liability companies whose members include financial institutions these financial institutions are noncontrolling tax equity investors to which earnings tax attributes and cash flows are allocated in accordance with the respective limited liability company agreements we discuss these tax equity arrangements in “variable interest entities” and in “noncontrolling interests” in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sempra renewables’ remaining wind energy generation facilities that were operational as of december 31 2018 have a contracted capacity of 1260 mw and are fully contracted under longterm ppas for 15 to 25 years 

demand and competition 

generation from sempra renewables’ remaining renewable energy assets consisting of wind energy generation facilities is susceptible to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind and inclement weather 

sempra renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity sempra renewables also competes with other nonutility generators regulated utilities unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy service companies for sales of noncontracted renewable energy the number and type of competitors may vary based on location generation type and project size

sempra lng  midstream 

sempra lng  midstream develops owns and operates or holds interests in lng and natural gas midstream assets and operations in north america including cameron lng jv natural gas pipelines and marketing operations 

on february 7 2019 sempra lng  midstream completed the sale of its nonutility natural gas storage assets in the southeast us comprised of mississippi hub and bay gas to an affiliate of arclight capital partners we discuss this sale below and in notes 5 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

lng 

sempra lng  midstream and three project coowners hold interests in cameron lng jv for the development construction and operation of a threetrain natural gas liquefaction export facility at the existing cameron lng llc terminal formerly used for regasification in hackberry louisiana a project developed and permitted by sempra lng  midstream sempra lng  midstream accounts for its 502percent equity interest in cameron lng jv under the equity method cameron lng jv began construction in the second half of 2014 on the natural gas liquefaction export facility using the existing regasification infrastructure contributed by sempra lng  midstream cameron lng jv has authorization to export lng to both fta and nonfta countries 

the three liquefaction trains are designed to have a nameplate capacity of 139 mtpa of lng with an expected export capability of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf per day cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of total sa mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd which subscribe the full nameplate capacity of three trains at the facility in addition cameron lng jv is working on the development of up to two additional trains we discuss cameron lng jv in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the construction of the first three trains and the potential for an additional two trains in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

sempra energy is also taking steps to explore the development of additional lng export facilities at sempra lng  midstream’s port arthur texas property and sempra mexico’s eca regasification facility we discuss these opportunities in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

demand and competition technological advances associated with shale gas and tight oil production have significantly reduced the need for north american lng import facilities and increased interest in liquefaction and export opportunities 

at current forward gas prices us gulf coast liquefaction is among the most price competitive potential lng supply in the world brownfield liquefaction is particularly price competitive resulting from many factors including 

 global lng competition may limit us lng exports as international liquefaction projects attempt to match us gulf coast lng production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility it is expected that us lng exports will increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand and thereby facilitate development of a global commodity market for natural gas and lng 

our lng liquefaction business’ major domestic and international competitors currently would include among others the following companies and their related lng affiliates 



additionally our cameron lng jv coowners affiliates of total sa mitsubishi corporation through a related company jointly established with nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha and mitsui  co ltd compete globally to market and sell lng to end users including gas and electric utilities located in lng importing countries around the world by providing liquefaction services cameron lng jv will compete indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global lng market in addition to the us these competitors are located in the middle east southeast asia africa south america australia and europe 

midstream

regulation 

california state utility regulation 

the california utilities are principally regulated at the state level by the cpuc the cec and the carb  

the cpuc 

 the cpuc also oversees and regulates new products and services including solar and wind energy bioenergy alternative energy storage and other forms of renewable energy in addition the cpuc’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety violations 

the cec publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based on these forecasts the cec 

 the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the california utilities’ longterm investment decisions 

the state of california requires certain california electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver a percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the rps program we discuss this requirement as it applies to sdge in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” 

california ab 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 assigns responsibility to carb for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing ghg emissions the bill requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a department within the california environmental protection agency an organization that reports directly to the governor’s office in the executive 

branch of california state government sempra lng  midstream and sempra mexico are also subject to the rules and regulations of carb 

the operation and maintenance of socalgas’ natural gas storage facilities are regulated by doggr as well as various other state and local agencies 

texas state utility regulation 

oncor’s transmission and distribution rates are regulated by the puct and certain cities and in certain limited instances by the ferc the puct has original jurisdiction over transmission and distribution rates and services in unincorporated areas and in those municipalities that have ceded original jurisdiction to the puct and has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review the rate and service orders and ordinances of municipalities generally the texas pura prohibits the collection of any rates or charges by a public utility as defined by pura that do not have the prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authority ie the puct or the municipality with original jurisdiction 

at the state level pura requires owners or operators of transmission facilities to provide openaccess wholesale transmission services to third parties at rates and terms that are nondiscriminatory and comparable to the rates and terms of the utility’s own use of its system the puct has adopted rules implementing the state openaccess requirements for all utilities that are subject to the puct’s jurisdiction over transmission services including oncor 

us utility regulation

foreign regulation 

sempra south american utilities has two utilities in south america that are subject to laws and regulations in the localities and countries in which they operate these utilities serve primarily regulated customers and their revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the cne in chile and the osinergmin in peru as we discuss below in “ratemaking mechanisms – sempra south american utilities” 

operations and projects in our sempra mexico segment are subject to regulation by the cre the mexican safety energy and environment agency agencia de seguridad energía y ambiente the mexican secretary of energy secretaría de energía and other labor and environmental agencies of city state and federal governments in mexico 

licenses and permits 

the california utilities and sempra texas utility obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses for the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets including electric generation and natural gas storage facilities some of which may require periodic renewal 

sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses for their electric and natural gas distribution generation and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided the respective energy ministries in chile or peru granted the concessions to operate chilquinta energía’s and luz del sur’s distribution operations for indefinite terms not requiring renewal the permits for generation transportation storage and distribution operations at sempra mexico are generally for 30year terms with options for renewal under certain regulatory conditions 

sempra mexico and sempra lng  midstream obtain licenses and permits for the construction operation and expansion of lng facilities and for the import and export of lng and natural gas sempra mexico also obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of terminals for the receipt storage and delivery of liquid fuels 

sempra renewables obtains permits authorizations and licenses for the construction and operation of power generation facilities and for the wholesale distribution of electricity 

sempra lng  midstream obtains permits authorizations and licenses for the construction and operation of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines and in connection with participation in the wholesale electricity market 

most of the permits and licenses associated with construction and operations within the sempra renewables and sempra lng  midstream businesses are for periods generally in alignment with the construction cycle or life of the asset and in many cases are greater than 20 years 

ratemaking mechanisms 

california utilities 

general rate case proceedings a cpuc grc proceeding is designed to set sufficient base rates to allow the california utilities to recover their reasonable forecasted cost of om and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investment the proceeding generally establishes the test year revenue requirements which authorizes how much the california utilities can collect from their customers and provides for attrition or annual increases in revenue requirements for each year following the test year the cpuc generally conducts a grc every three years 

cost of capital proceedings a cpuc cost of capital proceeding determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base which is a weightedaverage of the authorized returns on debt preferred stock and common equity referred to as return on equity or roe weighted on a basis consistent with the authorized capital structure the authorized return on rate base approved by the cpuc is the rate that the california utilities use to establish customer rates to recover costs incurred to finance investments in cpucregulated electric distribution and generation as well as natural gas distribution and transmission assets 

a cost of capital proceeding also addresses the ccm which applies marketbased benchmarks to determine whether an adjustment to the authorized return on rate base is required during the interim years between cost of capital proceedings the automatic ccm did not operate in 2018 the ccm will be reviewed in the next cost of capital proceeding scheduled to be filed in april 2019 for a january 1 2020 implementation the ccm if renewed in the 2019 cost of capital proceeding in a form similar to its previous design could automatically adjust roe up or down based on the monthly moody’s utility bond index beginning in 2021 sdge’s and socalgas’ current cost of capital will continue through 2019 beginning in 2020 the conclusions authorized in the cost of capital proceeding could impact the cost of debt including debt and roe capital structure and the ccm 

we also discuss the cost of capital and ccm in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

transmission rate cases sdge files separately with the ferc for its authorized roe on fercregulated electric transmission operations and assets the to4 settlement agreement approved by the ferc in may 2014 and in effect through december 31 2018 established a 1005 percent roe the settlement also established 1 a process whereby rates are determined using a base period of historical costs and a forecast of capital investments and 2 a trueup period similar to balancing account treatment that is designed to provide sdge earnings of no more and no less than its actual cost of service including its authorized return on investment sdge makes annual information filings on december 1 of each year to update rates for the following calendar year 

sdge submitted its to5 filing with the ferc in october 2018 with a proposed ferc roe of 112 percent to be effective january 1 2019 in december 2018 the ferc issued an order accepting the filing suspending its implementation until june 1 2019 subject to refund and establishing hearing and settlement procedures which we discuss in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sdge also has the right to file for any roe incentives that might apply under ferc rules sdge’s debttoequity ratio will be set annually based on the actual ratio at the end of each year 

incentive mechanisms the cpuc applies performancebased measures and incentive mechanisms to all california ious under which the california utilities have earnings potential above authorized cpuc base operating margin if they achieve or exceed specific performance and operating goals generally for performancebased awards if performance is above or below specific benchmarks the utility is eligible for financial awards or subject to financial penalties 

sdge has incentive mechanisms associated with 

 socalgas has incentive mechanisms associated with 

 other costbased recovery the cpuc authorizes the california utilities to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs that they have been authorized to pass on to customers including the costs to purchase electricity and natural gas and those associated with administering public purpose demand response and customer energy efficiency programs actual costs are recovered as the commodity or service is delivered or to the extent actual amounts vary from forecasts generally recovered or refunded within a subsequent period based on the nature of the account overcollections and undercollections represent differences between cash collected in current rates and amounts due for specified components including costs depreciation and return on rate base probable of recovery from ratepayers the lagging aspect of overcollections and undercollections impacts cash flows until these respective amounts are trued up with collections from customers 

because changes in sdge’s and socalgas’ cost of electricity andor natural gas is substantially recovered in rates through a balancing account mechanism changes in these costs are offset in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings 

we also discuss regulatory matters in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sempra texas utility 

rates and cost recovery oncor’s rates are regulated by the puct and certain cities and are subject to regulatory ratesetting processes and annual earnings oversight this regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings levels oncor’s rates are regulated based on an analysis of its costs and capital structure as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital however there is no assurance that the puct will judge all of oncor’s costs to have been prudently incurred that the puct will not reduce the amount of invested capital included in the capital structure that oncor’s rates are based upon that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce full recovery of oncor’s costs or that oncor’s authorized roe will not be reduced 

the pura allows utilities to file under certain circumstances once per year and up to four rate adjustments between comprehensive base rate proceedings to recover distributionrelated investments on an interim basis puct substantive rules also allow oncor to update its transmission rates periodically to reflect changes in invested capital these “capital tracker” provisions encourage investment in the electric system to help ensure reliability and efficiency by allowing for timely recovery of and return on new investments 

capital structure and return on equity in october 2017 the puct approved new rates in oncor’s 2017 rate review that took effect on november 27 2017 oncor’s puctauthorized roe is 98 percent and its authorized regulatory capital structure is 575 percent debt to 425 percent equity 

sempra south american utilities 

chilquinta energía and luz del sur our electric distribution utilities in south america recognize revenues based on tariffs that are set by government agencies in their respective countries based on an efficient model distribution company defined by those agencies the tariffs are based on a model and are intended to cover the costs of the model company because the tariffs are not based on the costs of the specific utility they may not result in full cost recovery the tariffs are designed to provide for a pass 

through to customers of transmission and energy charges recovery of reasonable operating and administrative costs incentives to reduce costs and make needed capital investments and a regulated rate of return on the distributor’s regulated asset base 

chilquinta energía’s revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the cne the cne’s review process for authorized distribution and transmission rates generally remains in effect for a period of four years the cne reviews rates for fouryear periods related to distribution and transmission separately on an alternating basis every two years 

luz del sur’s revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the osinergmin the components of tariffs for luz del sur are reviewed and adjusted every four years 

we discuss recent rate reviews for chilquinta energía and luz del sur in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sempra mexico 

ecogas’ revenues are derived from service and distribution fees charged to its customers in pesos the price ecogas pays to purchase natural gas which is based on international price indices is passed through directly to its customers the service and distribution fees charged by ecogas are regulated by the cre which performs a review of rates every five years and monitors prices charged to endusers the tariffs operate under a returnonassetbase model in the annual tariff adjustment rates are adjusted to account for inflation or fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation indexing includes separate us and mexican cost components so that us costs can be included in the final distribution rates 

environmental matters 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “item 1a risk factors” you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions 

hazardous substances 

the cpuc’s hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allows california’s ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the california utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the california utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates 

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets 

air and water quality 

the electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent air quality and ghg standards such as those established by the carb and scaqmd the california utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards we discuss ghg standards and credits further in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we discuss environmental matters concerning socalgas’ aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” and in “item 1a risk factors”

 item 1a risk factors 

when evaluating our company and its subsidiaries you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report these risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf we may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of the following occurs our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially adversely affected in addition the trading prices of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning our company set forth in or attached as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k including without limitation the information set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 mda” in this section when we state that a risk or uncertainty may could or will have a “material adverse effect” on us or may could or will “materially adversely affect” us we mean that the risk or uncertainty may could or will as the case may be have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition prospects andor the trading prices of our securities or those of our subsidiaries 

risks related to sempra energy 

sempra energy’s cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and entities that are accounted for as equity method investments such as oncor holdings and the ability to utilize the cash flows from those subsidiaries and equity method investments 

we are a holding company and substantially all our assets are owned by our subsidiaries and in entities accounted for as equity method investments such as oncor holdings our ability to pay dividends and to meet our debt and other obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from our subsidiaries and jvs and other entities in which we have invested and in the short term our ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from our subsidiaries and other entities in which we have invested depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own expenditures common and preferred stock dividends and debt or other obligations in addition the subsidiaries and other entities accounted for as equity method investments are separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us whether to enable us to pay principal and interest on our debt securities our other obligations or dividends on our common stock or our preferred stock and could be precluded from paying any such dividends or making any such loans or distributions under certain circumstances including without limitation as a result of legislation regulation court order contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress the inability to access capital from our subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments as well from the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition 

certain credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place those ratings on negative outlook 

credit rating agencies routinely evaluate sempra energy sdge and socalgas and their longterm and shortterm debt ratings are based on a number of factors including the perceived supportiveness of the regulatory environment affecting utility operations ability to generate cash flows level of indebtedness overall financial strength and the status of certain capital projects as well as factors beyond our control such as tax reform the state of the economy and our industry generally 

moody’s sp and fitch ratings have increasingly focused on the increased risk of wildfires in california the current california regulatory environment and the doctrine of inverse condemnation which under california law imposes strict liability on a utility whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire meaning that the utility may be found liable regardless of fault in 2018 and primarily as a result of their position on the increased risk of wildfires in california and the current california regulatory environment each of moody’s sp and fitch ratings downgraded sdge’s issuer rating senior secured and senior unsecured credit ratings on january 21 2019 sp downgraded sdge’s issuer credit rating to bbb from a while maintaining its negative outlook on january 22 2019 fitch ratings affirmed sdge’s longterm issuer default rating at a but revised the rating outlook to negative from stable on january 24 2019 moody’s placed sdge under review for downgrade the ratings actions in january 2019 were primarily the result of recent wildfires in california in counties outside of the california utilities’ electric service territory and the possible inability to recover costs and expenses in cases where california ious like the california utilities are determined to have had their equipment be the cause of a fire while sdge’s credit ratings are investment grade each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no assurance that sdge’s current credit ratings and ratings outlooks will remain the same or that sdge’s credit ratings will not be further downgraded 

also in 2018 each of moody’s sp and fitch ratings affirmed credit ratings of sempra energy and socalgas with moody’s and sp changing sempra energy’s outlook to negative and sp changing socalgas’ outlook to negative 

for sempra energy the credit rating agencies noted that the following among other things could lead to negative ratings actions 

 for socalgas the credit rating agencies noted that the following among others could lead to a negative ratings action 

 while sempra energy’s and socalgas’ credit ratings are investment grade each of the credit rating agencies reviews their ratings periodically and there is no assurance that sempra energy’s and socalgas’ current credit ratings and ratings outlooks will remain the same or that sempra energy’s andor socalgas’ credit ratings will not be downgraded 

a downgrade of sempra energy’s or any of its subsidiaries’ credit ratings or rating outlooks may result in a requirement for collateral to be posted in the case of certain financing arrangements and may materially and adversely affect the market prices of their equity and debt securities the rates at which borrowings are made and commercial paper is issued and the various fees on their outstanding credit facilities this could make it significantly more costly for sempra energy sdge socalgas and sempra energy’s other subsidiaries to issue debt securities to borrow under credit facilities and to raise certain other types of capital andor complete additional financings such amounts could materially and adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations 

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects as well as our ability to meet contractual and 

other commitments in difficult credit market environments we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support new or ongoing business activities this could cause us to reduce nonsafety related capital expenditures and could increase our cost of servicing debt both of which could significantly reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability 

in addition our variable rate indebtedness and credit facilities may incorporate libor as a benchmark for establishing certain rates libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness andor borrowings  and could impact the applicability of our cash flow hedges 

other factors can affect the availability and cost of credit for our businesses as well as the terms of equity and debt financing including 

 in addition over the past two years california ious have suffered from the potential catastrophic losses resulting from the impact of the multiple wildfires that spread through northern and southern california the “california wildfires” while the california wildfires occurred in counties outside of the california utilities’ electric service territory the uncertainty about the outcomes of these matters and the possibility of catastrophic wildfires in the future have negatively impacted confidence in california ious generally which could materially and adversely impact sempra energy’s and the california utilities’ ability to access the capital markets at rates that we believe are commercially reasonable 

sempra energy has substantial investments in mexico and south america which expose us to foreign currency inflation legal tax economic geopolitical and management oversight risk 

we have significant foreign operations in mexico and south america our foreign operations pose complex management foreign currency inflation legal tax and economic risks certain of these risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic businesses all our international businesses are sensitive to geopolitical uncertainties and our nonutility international businesses are sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers all of which may be driven by changes in their environments and potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions and various regional and local economic and political factors risks and uncertainties as well as us foreign policy foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on our revenue costs or cash flows from our international operations which could materially adversely affect our financial performance our currency exposures are to the mexican peruvian and chilean currencies our mexican subsidiaries have us dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities that give rise to mexican currency exchange rate movements for mexican income tax purposes they also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are significant denominated in the mexican peso that must be translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes in addition monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes our primary objective when we attempt to reduce foreign currency risk is to preserve the economic value of our foreign investments and to reduce earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations we may attempt to hedge material crosscurrency transactions and earnings exposure through various means including financial instruments and shortterm investments we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries we are susceptible to volatility in oci caused by exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to our south american subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the us dollar we discuss our foreign currency exposure at our mexican subsidiaries in “item 7 mda” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

the current us administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements such as nafta and us immigration policy by reviewing various options including tariffs for funding new mexicous border security infrastructure for example in november 2018 president trump signed the usmca which if approved by the legislatures of the us mexico and canada would replace nafta such actions could result in changes in the mexican us and other markets that could materially 

adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects in addition if nafta is replaced or the us withdraws from the agreement the mexican government could implement retaliatory actions such as the imposition of restrictions or import fees on mexican imports of natural gas from the us or imports and exports of electricity to and from the us any of these actions by either or both governments could adversely affect imports and exports between mexico and the us and negatively impact the us and mexican economies and the companies with whom we conduct business in mexico which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects 

we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our plan to divest certain of our assets as part of our capital rotation plan our north american business strategy or our cost reduction efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in june 2018 we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to divest all our us solar and wind assets and certain nonutility natural gas storage assets in the southeast us collectively the nonutility us assets additionally in january 2019 we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to sell our south american businesses while we have completed the sale of a substantial portion of the nonutility us assets and expect to complete the sale of the remaining nonutility us assets in the second quarter of 2019 the pending sale will depend on the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions while we expect to complete the sale of our south american businesses by the end of 2019 the planned sale will depend on several factors that may be beyond our control including but not limited to market conditions industry trends consent rights or other rights granted to or held by third parties and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms further there can be no assurance that the completed sales or the pending and planned sales if completed will result in additional value to our shareholders or that we will be able to redeploy any capital that we obtain from such sales in a way that would result in additional value to our shareholders 

if we do not successfully manage our current capital rotation plan our north american business strategy or our cost reduction efforts or any other such activities that we may initiate in the future any expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted 

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders 

while we strive to maintain constructive ongoing communications with all our shareholders and welcome their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all our shareholders activist shareholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management responding to proposals by activist shareholders including in connection with a proxy contest instituted by shareholders would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees proxy solicitation expenses in the case of a proxy contest and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy for example on june 11 2018 elliott associates lp and elliott international lp collectively elliott and bluescape resources company llc bluescape collectively holders of an approximately 49percent economic interest in our outstanding common stock as of such date delivered a letter and accompanying presentation to our board of directors seeking collaboration with them and management to nominate six new directors identified by elliott and bluescape and establish a committee of the board of directors to conduct portfolio and operational reviews of our business on september 18 2018 we announced that we entered into a cooperation agreement with elliott bluescape and cove key management lp under the cooperation agreement each party has agreed to certain customary standstill restrictions until december 31 2019 which is subject to extension until september 30 2020 under certain circumstances there can be no assurance that the cooperation agreement will be extended and any failure to secure an extension or a termination of the agreement without a resolution could negatively impact the market price of our common stock preferred stock and other securities in addition upon termination of the cooperation agreement elliott bluescape andor cove key management lp may among other things attempt to effect additional significant changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management which may disrupt our operations by requiring significant time and attention by management and our board of directors we discuss the cooperation agreement in “mda  factors influencing future performance” 

any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control our ability to execute on our strategy or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from proposals by activist shareholders or a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability that may be exploited by our competitors andor other activist shareholders result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners any of which could have an adverse effect which may be material on our business and operating results we may choose to initiate or may become subject to litigation as a result of proposals by activist shareholders or proxy contests or matters relating thereto which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and management and could require us to incur significant additional costs 

actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in the trading prices of our common stock and our preferred stock based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

the tcja may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows the value of investments in our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

the tcja significantly changed the irc including taxation of us corporations by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate altering the expensing of capital expenditures limiting interest deductions adopting elements of a territorial tax system assessing a onetime deemed repatriation tax on cumulative undistributed earnings of usowned foreign entities at the time of enactment and introducing certain antibase erosion provisions certain aspects of the legislation are subject to interpretation and will require implementing regulations by the us department of the treasury as well as state tax authorities the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts in addition the regulatory treatment of the impacts of this legislation will be subject to the discretion of the ferc and state public utility commissions 

although it is unclear when or how capital markets the ferc or state public utility commissions may respond to the tcja we do expect that certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies such as our funds from operationstodebt percentage will be negatively impacted as a result of an anticipated decrease in required income tax reimbursement payments to us from our domestic utility subsidiaries due to the decrease in the us statutory corporate income tax rate certain provisions of the tcja such as 100percent expensing of capital expenditures and impacts on utilization of our nols may influence how we fund capital expenditures the timing of capital expenditures and possible redeployment of capital through sales or monetization of assets the timing of repatriation of foreign earnings and the use of equity financing to reduce our future use of debt although there can be no assurance that these strategies will reduce any potential adverse impact from these provisions of the tcja in addition although we are not currently expecting the deductibility of our interest costs to affect future earnings based on our method of allocation across our businesses the interest deduction limitation under the tcja is subject to potential additional guidance or interpretation from the us department of the treasury and there can be no assurance that any such additional guidance will not impact our current assessment 

it is also uncertain whether additional avenues will evolve for companies to manage the adverse aspects of this legislation we believe that these strategies to the extent available and if successfully applied could lessen any such negative impacts on us although there can be no assurance in this regard in addition adoption of the tcja by state tax authorities additional interpretations regulations amendments or technical corrections could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and on the value of investments in our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

we discuss the effects of the tcja further in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 mda – results of operations” 

risks related to all sempra energy businesses 

severe weather conditions natural disasters accidents equipment failures explosions or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by severe weather conditions natural disasters such as fires earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes tsunamis floods mudslides accidents equipment failures explosions or acts of terrorism because we are in the business of using storing transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials as well as radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure as well as the risks to the surrounding communities are substantially greater than the risks such incidents may pose to a typical business the facilities and infrastructure that we own or in which we have interests that may be subject to such incidents include but are not limited to 

 such incidents could result in severe business disruptions prolonged power outages property damage injuries or loss of life significant decreases in revenues and earnings andor significant additional costs to us such incidents that do not directly affect 

our facilities may impact our business partners supply chains and transportation which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide natural gas and electricity to our customers any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires natural gas natural gas odorant propane or ethane leaks releases of other ghg radioactive releases explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties personal injuries health impacts or fatalities or present a nuisance to impacted communities any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us in some cases we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault such as in cases where the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies we discuss how the application of this doctrine in california imposes strict liability on a utility whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire meaning the utility may be found liable regardless of fault in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and below under “risks related to the california utilities – insurance coverage for future wildfires may be unobtainable prohibitively expensive or insufficient to cover losses we may incur and we may be unable to recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms” insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become prohibitively expensive may be disputed by the insurers or may become unavailable for certain of these risks or at sufficient levels and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to the existence of limitations exclusions high deductibles failure to comply with procedural requirements and other factors which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects as well as the trading prices of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and tax requirements and may be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulations or requirements or in their interpretation or implementation 

in recent years the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on the federal state and local levels these changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses moreover existing regulations laws and tariffs may be revised or reinterpreted and new regulations laws and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities special tariffs may also be imposed on components used in our businesses that could increase costs 

our businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements and the regulations laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs any new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations in the us and other countries in which we operate could materially adversely affect our tax expense andor tax balances and changes in tax policies could materially adversely impact our business changes in regulations laws and tariffs and how they are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the california utilities and other sempra energy businesses these rules are commonly referred to as “affiliate rules” which primarily impact commodity and commodityrelated transactions these businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or to their interpretations or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas to or to trade with the california utilities and with each other affiliate rules also restrict these businesses from entering into any such transactions with the california utilities any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the lng terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or other operations of our subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses require numerous permits licenses franchise agreements and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies any failure to obtain or maintain required permits licenses or approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

all our existing and planned development projects require multiple approvals the acquisition construction ownership and operation of marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels lng and lpg terminals and storage natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities and electric generation transmission and distribution infrastructure require numerous permits licenses franchise agreements certificates and other approvals from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies once received approvals may be subject to litigation and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed or modified in litigation or otherwise in addition permits licenses franchise agreements certificates and other approvals may be modified rescinded or fail to be extended by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses socalgas’ franchise agreements with los angeles county and the city of los angeles where the aliso canyon 

natural gas storage facility is located are due to expire in 2023 and 2019 respectively sdge’s franchise agreement with the city of san diego is due to expire in 2021 if there is a delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be precluded from constructing or operating facilities or we may be forced to incur additional costs further accidents beyond our control may cause us to violate the terms of conditional use permits causing delays in projects any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain necessary permits licenses certificates and other approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations and mandates relating to environmental protection including air quality water quality and usage wastewater discharge solid waste management hazardous waste disposal and remediation conservation of natural resources wetlands and wildlife renewable energy resources climate change and ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees the california utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs for projects are not recoverable in rates in addition we may be ultimately responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels lng and lpg terminals and storage natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution infrastructure and other energy projects and properties regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown which exposes us to risks arising from contamination at our former or existing facilities or with respect to offsite waste disposal sites that have been used in our operations in the case of our california and other regulated utilities some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates our facilities including those in our jvs are subject to laws and regulations that have been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to power generation facilities failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines andor significant curtailments of our operations which could materially adversely affect our cash flows andor results of operations 

increasing international national regional and statelevel environmental concerns as well as related new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as potential state national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations the implementation of recent and proposed california legislation and regulation may materially adversely affect our nonutility businesses by imposing among other things additional costs associated with emission limits controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits similarly sb 350 requires all loadserving entities including sdge to file integrated resource plans that are intended to ultimately enable the electric sector to achieve reductions in ghg emissions of 40 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030 our california utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates even if recoverable the effects of existing and proposed ghg emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth and may have a material adverse effect on the california utilities’ cash flows sdge may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

in addition existing and future laws orders and regulations regarding mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates methane or other emissions could result in requirements for additional monitoring pollution monitoring and control equipment safety practices or emission fees taxes or penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows 

we provide further discussion of these matters in “item 7 mda” and in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation against us 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and arbitration proceedings including in connection with the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility natural gas leak we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and proceedings and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings we discuss pending proceedings in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 mda” the uncertainties 

inherent in lawsuits arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part by insurance or in rates from our customers which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations andor financial condition 

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices in addition for those contract positions that are hedged our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition certain of the contracts we use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts in certain cases these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged 

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

although we have in place risk management and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended by our businesses or may not work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees 

several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a companybycompany basis any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

new business technologies implemented by us or developed by others present among other things a risk for increased attacks on our information systems and the integrity of our energy grid and our natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure 

in addition to general information and cyber risks that all fortune 500 corporations face eg malware malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information smart grid infrastructure and natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure deployment of new business technologies represents a new and largescale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer information as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure additionally we often rely on third party vendors to deploy new business technologies and maintain modify and update our systems including systems that manage sensitive information these third parties could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures to protect our systems and information while our computer systems have been and will continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malware unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks to date we have not detected a material breach of cybersecurity addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across sempra energy’s businesses including investing in risk management and information security measures to protect our systems the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated cyber risks despite our best efforts our businesses may not be fully insulated from cyberattacks and system disruptions an attack on our information systems the integrity of the energy grid our natural gas ethane lng lpg or propane pipeline and storage infrastructure or one of our facilities or unauthorized access to confidential customer information could result in energy delivery service failures financial and reputational loss violations of privacy laws customer dissatisfaction and litigation any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

in the ordinary course of business sempra energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees customer energy usage and other information the theft damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws subject us to claims from third parties require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations and harm our reputation sempra energy maintains cyber liability insurance but this insurance is limited in scope and subject to exceptions conditions and coverage limitations and may not cover any or even a substantial portion of the costs associated with the consequences of personal confidential or proprietary information being compromised and there is no guarantee that the insurance that we do maintain will continue to be available at rates that we believe are commercially reasonable 

further as seen with recent cyberattacks around the world the goal of a cyberattack may be primarily to inflict largescale harm on a company and the places where it operates any such cyberattack could cause widespread disruptions to our operating financial and administrative systems including the destruction of critical information and programming that could materially adversely affect our business operations and the integrity of the power grid negatively impact our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements or comply with ongoing disclosure obligations or other regulatory requirements andor release confidential information about our company and our customers employees and other constituents any of which could lead to sanctions or negatively affect the general perception of our business in the financial markets and which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

risks related to the california utilities 

the california utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may materially adversely affect us 

the cpuc regulates the california utilities’ rates except sdge’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates the california utilities’ 

 the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility operations safety standards and practices compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows socalgas and sdge may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines and storage and for sdge electric operations under regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety and citation programs concerning both gas and electric safety which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the california utilities’ rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in notes 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 mda” 

the cpuc periodically approves the california utilities’ rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs including income taxes and an authorized rate of return on investment as well as settlements delays by the cpuc on decisions authorizing recovery or denying recovery afterthefact reasonableness reviews with unclear standards authorizations for less than full recovery or rejection of their settlements may adversely affect the working capital cash flows and financial condition of each of the california utilities if the california utilities receive an adverse cpuc decision andor actual capital expenditures andor operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the cpuc our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected 

socalgas and sdge have significantly invested and continue to invest in major programs such as psep under an approved cpuc decision tree framework however the total investment to date is substantially subject to cpuc reasonableness review although we believe these costs have been prudently incurred the standards applied by the cpuc could result in the disallowance of a portion of these historical costs which could adversely affect sdge’s socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the cpuc now incorporates a riskbased decisionmaking framework in its review of grc applications for major natural gas and electric utilities in california we cannot estimate whether its application in the 2019 grc or future grc applications will result in full recovery of costs we discuss this further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in california there are laws that establish rules governing among other subjects communications between cpuc officials cpuc staff and regulated utilities rules and processes around ex parte communications could result in delayed decisions increased investigations enforcement actions and penalties in addition the cpuc or other parties may initiate investigations of past communications between public utilities and cpuc officials and staff that could result in reopening completed proceedings for reconsideration 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets and other similar matters involving sdge 

the california utilities may be materially adversely affected by new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies in addition existing legislation or regulations may be revised or reinterpreted new revised or reinterpreted legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how the california utilities operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses in september 2018 the governor of california signed into law sb 901 which includes a number of measures primarily intended to address certain wildfire risks relevant to consumers and utilities and guidelines for the cpuc to determine whether utilities acted reasonably in order to recover costs related to wildfires among other things sb 901 also contains provisions for utility issuance of recovery bonds with respect to certain wildfire costs subject to cpuc approval sb 901 did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation which imposes strict liability on a utility meaning that the utility may be found liable regardless of fault whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire  we are unable to predict how the cpuc will apply sb 901 and its impact on the california utilities’ ability to recover certain costs and expenses in cases where the california utilities’ equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation 

the construction and expansion of the california utilities’ natural gas pipelines socalgas’ storage facilities and sdge’s electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits licenses rightsofway and other approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies including approvals and renewals of rightsofway over native american tribal land held in trust by the federal government successfully maintaining or renewing any or all of these approvals could result in higher costs or in the event one or more of these approvals were to expire could require us to remove the associated assets from service construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area or both and our ability to recover higher costs associated with these events cannot be assured if there are delays in obtaining these approvals failure to obtain or maintain these approvals difficulties in renewing rightsofway and other property rights or failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations the california utilities’ businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be adversely affected 

successfully coordinating and completing expansion and construction projects requires good execution from our employees and contractors cooperation of third parties and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay in the event that one or more of these projects is delayed or experiences significant cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on the california utilities the california utilities may invest a significant amount of money in a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if the project does not receive regulatory approval if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes or if management decides not to proceed with the project they may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project which could materially adversely affect their financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

our california utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as turn utility consumers’ action network sierra club and other stakeholder advocacy and activist groups operations that may be influenced by these groups include 



 extreme weather conditions changing weather patterns and population growth in areas of the state of california in environments with historically higher risk of wildfires could materially affect the california utilities’ and sempra energy’s business financial condition results of operations liquidity and cash flows 

frequent and more severe drought conditions unseasonably warm temperatures and stronger winds have increased the degree and prevalence of wildfires in california including in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories which could place third party property and our electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy and reduce the availability of hydroelectric generators this could result in temporary power shortages in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories andor catastrophic destruction of third party property for which sdge or socalgas may be liable and unable to recover from ratepayers or may have inadequate insurance coverage sb 901 signed into law in 2018 includes a number of measures primarily intended to address certain wildfire risks relevant to consumers and utilities and guidelines for the cpuc to determine whether utilities acted reasonably in order to recover costs related to wildfires however in the event of a significant wildfire involving sdge equipment sb 901 may not be sufficient to enable timely access to capital necessary to address in whole or in part inverse condemnation liabilities or could result in the inability to pass such liabilities through to customers even if sdge complies with its wildfire mitigation plans in addition to these changing environmental conditions the state of california has been subject to housing shortages such that certain local land use policies and forestry management practices have been relaxed in certain cases to allow for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in high risk fire areas that may not have the infrastructure or contingency plans necessary to address such risk in addition severe weather conditions could result in delays andor cost increases to our capital projects 

severe rainstorms and associated high winds in our service territories as well as flooding and mudslides where vegetation has been destroyed as result of human modification or wildfires could damage our electric and natural gas infrastructure resulting in increased expenses including higher maintenance and repair costs and interruptions in electricity and natural gas delivery services as a result these events can have significant financial consequences including regulatory penalties and disallowances if the california utilities encounter difficulties in restoring service to their customers on a timely basis further the cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process any such events could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the california utilities’ facilities including gas and electric transmission and distribution assets the california utilities could incur substantial costs to repair or replace these facilities restore service or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries 

events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the california utilities’ operations than the california utilities currently anticipate if the cpuc fails to adjust the california utilities’ rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change or if a major fire is determined to be caused by our equipment sempra energy’s and the california utilities’ business financial condition results of operations liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected 

insurance coverage for future wildfires may be unobtainable prohibitively expensive or insufficient to cover losses we may incur and we may be unable to recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms 

we have experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the california utilities’ operations particularly sdge’s operations in addition the insurance that has been obtained for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses that we may incur uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates california courts have invoked the doctrine of inverse condemnation for wildfire damages whereby if a utility company’s equipment such as its electric distribution and transmission lines are determined to be a cause of one or more fires the utility could be held strictly liable for damages as well as attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent as a result of the strict liability standard applied to wildfires recent losses recorded by insurance companies and the risk of an increase in the number and size of wildfires insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be available or may be available only at rates that are prohibitively expensive in addition even if insurance for wildfire liabilities is available it may not be available in such amounts as are necessary to cover potential losses a loss which is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates which was the result in a decision by the cpuc denying sdge’s recovery of costs for the 2007 wildfires could materially adversely affect sempra energy’s and one or both of the california utilities’ financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are unable to predict whether we would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses 

the california utilities are subject to risks arising from the operation and improvement of their electricity and natural gas infrastructure and information technology systems which if they materialize could adversely affect sempra energy’s and the california utilities’ financial results 

the california utilities own and operate electric transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas storage facilities which are in many cases interconnected andor managed by information technology systems the california utilities undertake substantial capital investment projects to construct replace improve and upgrade these facilities and systems but while these capital investment projects are in process and even once completed there is a risk of among other things potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure and information technology systems human error in operations or maintenance shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment material and labor operational restrictions resulting from environmental requirements and governmental interventions and performance below expected levels in addition as discussed above weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation transmission and distribution delivery systems because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties 

additional risks associated with the ability of the california utilities to safely and reliably operate maintain improve and upgrade their facilities and systems many of which are beyond the california utilities’ control include 

 the occurrence of any of these events could affect demand for electricity or natural gas cause unplanned outages damage the california utilities’ assets andor operations damage the assets andor operations of third parties on which the california utilities rely damage property owned by customers or others and cause personal injury or death as a result the california utilities could incur costs to purchase replacement power to repair assets and restore service and to compensate third parties any such events could materially adversely affect sempra energy’s and one or both of the california utilities’ financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

socalgas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs and expenses related to the natural gas leak at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and mitigating local community environmental impacts from the leak some or a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance and socalgas also may incur significant liabilities for damages restitution fines penalties and other costs and emissions mitigation activities as a result of this incident some or a significant portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance or may exceed insurance coverage 

in october 2015 socalgas discovered a leak at one of its injectionandwithdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility located in the northern part of the san fernando valley in los angeles county california ss25 is one of more than 100 injectionandwithdrawal wells at the storage facility socalgas worked closely with several of the world’s leading experts to stop the leak and in february 2016 doggr confirmed that the well was permanently sealed 

local community mitigation efforts 

pursuant to directives by the dph and orders by the la superior court socalgas provided temporary relocation support to residents in the nearby community who requested it  at significant cost to socalgas these programs ended in july 2016 

in may 2016 the dph issued a directive that socalgas additionally professionally clean in accordance with the proposed protocol prepared by the dph the homes of all residents located within the porter ranch neighborhood council boundary or who participated in the relocation program or who are located within a fivemile radius of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and experienced symptoms from the leak the directive socalgas disputes the directive contending that it is invalid and unenforceable and has filed a petition for writ of mandate to set aside the directive 

the costs incurred to remediate and stop the leak and to mitigate local community impacts have been significant and may increase and we may be subject to potentially significant damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs to the extent any of these costs are not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of 

applicable policy limits or if there are significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such amounts could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

civil and criminal litigation 

as of february 21 2019 393 lawsuits including approximately 48000 plaintiffs are pending against socalgas some of which have also named sempra energy 

five shareholder derivative actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties have been filed against certain officers and directors of sempra energy andor socalgas four of which were joined in a consolidated shareholder derivative complaint in august 2017 three complaints have also been filed by public entities including the california attorney general and the county of los angeles these complaints seek various remedies including injunctive relief abatement of the public nuisance civil penalties payment of the cost of a longitudinal health study and money damages as well as punitive damages and attorneys’ fees additional litigation may be filed against us in the future related to the leak or our responses thereto in august 2018 socalgas entered into an agreement to settle these public entity actions which was approved by the la superior court in february 2019 these various lawsuits have been coordinated before a single court and will be managed under master complaints 

additionally a misdemeanor criminal complaint was filed by the la county district attorney’s office as to which socalgas entered a settlement that was approved by the la superior court but is subject to appeal by certain residents in addition a federal securities class action alleging violation of the federal securities laws was filed against sempra energy and certain of its officers and directors in the sdca this complaint was dismissed by the court in march 2018 and in december 2018 the court declined to reconsider its order for a more detailed description of the civil and criminal lawsuits brought against us see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the costs of defending against the civil and criminal lawsuits cooperating with these investigations and any damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs if awarded or imposed as well as the costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible such amounts could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

natural gas storage operations and regulatory proceedings 

natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods including peak electric generation needs in the summer and heating needs in the winter the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility with a storage capacity of 86 bcf which represents 63 percent of socalgas’ natural gas storage inventory capacity is the largest socalgas storage facility and an important element of socalgas’ delivery system as a result of the leak beginning october 24 2015 pursuant to orders by doggr and the governor of the state of california and sb 380 socalgas suspended injection of natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in february 2017 the cpuc opened a proceeding pursuant to sb 380 to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region the order establishing the scope of the proceeding expressly excludes issues with respect to air quality public health causation culpability or cost responsibility regarding the leak following a comprehensive safety review and authorization by doggr and the cpuc’s executive director socalgas resumed limited injection operations in july 2017 limited withdrawals of natural gas from the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility began in 2017 and continued in 2018 to augment natural gas supplies during critical demand periods in january 2019 the cpuc concluded phase 1 of the proceeding initiated in february 2017 by establishing a framework for the hydraulic production cost and economic modeling assumptions for the potential reduction in usage or elimination of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility phase 2 of the proceeding began in the first quarter of 2019 and will evaluate the impacts of reducing or eliminating the usage of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility using the established framework and models 

if the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value  it could result in an impairment of the facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs andor additional capital expenditures and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized at december 31 2018 the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of 724 million  any significant impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations for the period in which it is recorded higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas may not be recoverable in customer rates and socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

governmental investigations orders and additional regulation 

various governmental agencies including doe doggr dph scaqmd carb los angeles regional water quality control board california division of occupational safety and health cpuc phmsa epa los angeles county district attorney’s office and california attorney general’s office have investigated or are investigating this incident in january 2016 doggr and the cpuc selected blade energy partners to conduct under their supervision an independent analysis of the technical root cause of the leak to be funded by socalgas the root cause analysis is ongoing and its timing is under the control of blade energy partners doggr and the cpuc 

in march 2016 the carb issued its recommended approach to achieve full mitigation of the emissions from the leak and in october 2016 issued its report concluding that socalgas should mitigate 109000 metric tons of methane to fully mitigate the ghg impacts of the leak this mitigation will be achieved through a mitigation agreement socalgas has entered in connection with its settlement of public entity complaints for a more detailed description of the settlement see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

phmsa doggr scaqmd epa and carb have each commenced separate rulemaking proceedings to adopt further regulations covering natural gas storage facilities and injection wells doggr has issued new draft regulations for all storage fields in california and in 2016 the california legislature enacted four separate bills providing for additional regulation of natural gas storage facilities additional hearings in the california legislature as well as with various other federal and state regulatory agencies may be scheduled and additional laws orders rules and regulations may be adopted 

higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas as a result of new laws orders rules and regulations arising out of this incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates and socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any such new laws orders rules and regulations 

insurance and estimated costs 

excluding directors’ and officers’ liability insurance we have at least four kinds of insurance policies that together provide between 12 billion and 14 billion in insurance coverage depending on the nature of the claims these policies are subject to various policy limits exclusions and conditions we intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for the costs we have incurred or may incur through december 31 2018 we have received 566 million of insurance proceeds for portions of controlofwell expenses lost gas temporary relocation and other costs there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for costs related to the leak under the applicable policies and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining additional recovery or these costs exceed the amount of our coverage such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial conditions and results of operations 

at december 31 2018 socalgas estimates that its costs related to the leak are 1055 million  which includes 1027 million of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance this estimate may rise significantly as more information becomes available in addition costs not included in the cost estimate of 1055 million could be material as described in “civil and criminal litigation” above the actions against us seek compensatory and punitive damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs which except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions are not included in the 1055 million cost estimate as it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the amount of damages restitution or civil administrative or criminal fines penalties or other costs the recorded amounts above also do not include costs to clean additional homes pursuant to the directive future legal costs to defend litigation and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate furthermore the cost estimate of 1055 million does not include certain other costs incurred by sempra energy through december 31 2018 associated with defending shareholder derivative lawsuits there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining insurance coverage for these costs under the applicable policies and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining coverage or these costs exceed the amount of our coverage such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operation s 

additional information 

we discuss aliso canyon natural gas storage facility matters further in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” 

natural gas pipeline safety assessments may not be fully or adequately recovered in rates 

pending the outcome of various regulatory agency evaluations of natural gas pipeline safety regulations practices and procedures sempra energy including the california utilities may incur incremental expense and capital investment associated with their natural gas pipeline operations and investments the california utilities filed implementation plans with the cpuc to test or replace natural gas transmission pipelines located in populated areas that either have not been pressure tested or lack sufficient documentation of a pressure test to enhance existing valve infrastructure and to retrofit pipelines to allow for the use of inline inspection technology referred to as socalgas’ and sdge’s psep 

in june 2014 the cpuc issued a final decision approving the utilities’ plan for implementing psep and established criteria to determine the amounts related to psep that may be recovered from ratepayers and the processes for recovery of such amounts including providing that such costs are subject to a reasonableness review in the future certain psep costs may be subject to recovery as determined by separate regulatory filings with the cpuc including grc filings 

various pseprelated proceedings are regularly pending before the cpuc regarding the california utilities’ reasonableness review and cost recovery requests which are often challenged by intervening parties these proceedings are described in more detail in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” in the future consumer advocacy groups may similarly challenge the california utilities’ petitions for recovery and recommend disallowances in whole or in part with respect to applications to recover psep costs 

from 2011 through 2018 socalgas and sdge have invested approximately 15 billion and 372 million  respectively in psep with substantial additional expenditures planned as of december 31 2018 socalgas has received approval for recovery of 33 million  if the cpuc denies or significantly delays rate recovery for psep and other gas pipeline safety costs incurred by socalgas and sdge it could materially adversely affect the respective company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the california utilities are subject to increasingly stringent safety standards and the potential for significant penalties if regulators deem either sdge or socalgas to be out of compliance 

sb 291 requires the cpuc to develop and maintain a safety enforcement program that includes procedures for monitoring data tracking and analysis and investigations and delegates citation authority to cpuc staff personnel under the direction of the cpuc executive director in exercising this citation authority the cpuc staff is to take into account voluntary reporting of potential violations voluntary resolution efforts undertaken prior history of violations the gravity of the violation and the degree of culpability the cpuc previously implemented both electric and gas safety enforcement programs whereby electric and gas utilities may be cited by cpuc staff for violations of the cpuc’s safety requirements or applicable federal standards 

under each enforcement program each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense the maximum penalty is 50000 per offense cpuc staff has authority to issue citations up to an administrative limit of 8 million per citation under either program and such citations may be appealed to the cpuc although citations issued under these enforcement programs do include an administrative limit penalties issued by the cpuc can exceed this limit having exceeded 15 billion in one instance for an unrelated third party 

if the cpuc or its staff determine that either of sdge’s or socalgas’ operations and practices are not in compliance with applicable safety standards and operating procedures the corrective or mitigation actions required to be in conformance if not sufficiently funded in customer rates and any penalties imposed could materially adversely affect that company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the failure by the cpuc to continue reforms of sdge’s rate structure including the implementation of charges independent of consumption volume and reforms to reduce nem rate subsidies could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

the current electric residential rate structure in california is primarily based on consumption volume which places a higher rate burden on customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers 

the nem program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of onsite renewable generation primarily solar installations under nem qualifying customergenerators receive a full retail rate for the energy they generate that is fed to the utility’s power grid this occurs during times when the customer’s generation exceeds their own energy usage wholesale rates apply only if a customer’s annual generation exceeds their annual consumption under this structure nem customers do not pay their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system subject to certain limitations while they still receive electricity from the system when their selfgeneration is inadequate to meet their electricity needs the unpaid nem costs are subsidized by customers not participating in nem accordingly as higher electricuse residential customers switch to nem and selfgenerate energy the burden on the remaining customers increases which in turn encourages more selfgeneration further increasing rate pressure on existing customers 

sdge implemented a successor nem tariff in july 2016 after reaching the 617mw cap established for the original nem program the successor nem tariff requires nem customers to pay some costs that would otherwise be borne by nonnem customers and moves new nem customers to tou rates these changes to the nem program begin a process of reducing the cost burden on nonnem customers but sdge believes that further reforms are necessary and appropriate in a january 2016 decision the cpuc committed to revisit the nem successor tariff and the adequacy of its nem reforms and we expect the review to begin in the second half of 2019 

the status of broader rate reform was established in july 2015 when the cpuc adopted a decision that provides a framework for rates that are more transparent fair and sustainable the decision provides for a minimum monthly bill fewer rate tiers and a gradual reduction in the differences between the tiered rates directs the utilities to pursue expanded tou rates and implemented a superuser electric surcharge for usage that exceeds the baseline amount of energy used by customers by approximately 400 percent the decision is being implemented over a fiveyear period from 2015 to 2020 the decision should result in relief for higheruse customers that do not exceed the superuser threshold and a rate structure that better aligns rates with actual costs to serve customers the decision also establishes a process for utilities to seek implementation of a fixed charge for residential customers in 2020 but it also sets certain conditions for the implementation of a fixed charge after the initial reforms are implemented we believe the establishment of a charge independent of consumption volume for residential customers may become more critical to help ensure rates are fair for all customers distributed energy resources and energy efficiency initiatives could generally reduce delivered volumes increasing the importance of a fixed charge in addition the continuing increase of solar installations and other forms of selfgeneration adversely impacts the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system and could increase fixed costs 

if the cpuc fails to continue to reform sdge’s rate structure to maintain reasonable costbased electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system such failure could lead to the disallowance of recovery for our costs including power procurement costs operating or capital costs or the imposition of fines and penalties any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

the electricity industry is undergoing significant change including increased deployment of distributed energy resources technological advancements and political and regulatory developments 

electric utilities in california are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources such as solar energy storage energy efficiency and demand response technologies this growth will eventually require modernization of the electric distribution grid to among other things accommodate twoway flows of electricity and increase the grid’s capacity to interconnect distributed energy resources the cpuc is conducting proceedings to evaluate various demonstration projects and pilots implement changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources and if feasible what if any compensation would be appropriate and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator these proceedings may result in new regulations policies andor operational changes that could materially adversely affect sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

sdge provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a longterm basis while sdge provides such procurement service for most of its customer load customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than sdge through programs such as da and cca da is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours utility customers could also receive procurement through cca if the customer’s local jurisdiction city offers such a program several local political jurisdictions including the city of san diego and other municipalities are considering or implementing a cca which could result in the departure of more than half of sdge’s bundled load when customers are served by another load serving entity sdge no longer serves this departing load and the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources could be borne by its remaining bundled procurement customers state law requires that customers opting to have a cca procure their electricity must absorb the cost of abovemarket electricity procurement commitments already made by sdge on their behalf if adequate mechanisms are not maintained to ensure compliance with state law remaining bundled customers of sdge could potentially experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of cca customers prior to their departure which may not be fully recoverable in rates by sdge if legislative regulatory or legal action were taken to prevent the timely recovery of these procurement costs or if mechanisms are not in place to ensure compliance with state law the unrecovered costs could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

natural gas and natural gas storage used in california to generate electricity has increasingly been the subject of political and public scrutiny including a desire by some to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source 

california legislators and stakeholder advocacy and activist groups have expressed a desire to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source by advocating increased use of renewable energy and electrification in lieu of the use of natural gas a substantial reduction or the elimination of natural gas as an energy source in california could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility that is being decommissioned 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs formerly a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california that is in the process of being decommissioned by edison the majority owner of songs songs is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc and the cpuc sdge and each of the other owners holds its undivided interest as a tenant in common in the property and each owner is responsible for financing its share of expenses and capital expenditures including decommissioning activities although the facility is being decommissioned sdge’s ownership interest in songs continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility which include 

 in addition sdge maintains ndts for providing funds to decommission songs trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities which are subject to significant market fluctuations a decline in the market value of trust assets or an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts could increase the funding requirements for these trusts which in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates furthermore cpuc approval is required in order to make withdrawals from these trusts cpuc approval for certain expenditures may be denied by the cpuc altogether if the cpuc determines that the expenditures are unreasonable finally decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the trust funds rate recovery for overruns would require cpuc approval which may not occur 

interpretations of tax regulations could impact access to ndt funds for reimbursement of spent nuclear fuel management costs depending on how the irs or the us department of treasury ultimately interprets or alters regulations addressing the taxation of a qualified ndt sdge may be restricted from withdrawing amounts from its qualified decommissioning trusts to pay for spent fuel management while edison and sdge are seeking or plan to seek recovery of spent fuel management costs in litigation against or in settlements with the doe in december 2016 the irs and the us department of treasury issued proposed regulations that clarify the definition of “nuclear decommissioning costs” which are costs that may be paid for or reimbursed from a qualified trust fund these proposed regulations will be effective prospectively once they are finalized sdge is awaiting the adoption of or additional refinement to the proposed regulations before determining whether the proposed regulations will allow sdge to access the ndt funds for reimbursement or payment of the spent fuel management costs incurred in 2017 and subsequent years until the doe litigation is resolved andor irs regulations regarding spent fuel management costs are confirmed to apply sdge expects to continue to pay for its share of such spent fuel management costs if sdge is unable to obtain timely access to the trusts for these costs sdge’s cash flows could be negatively impacted 

the occurrence of any of these events could result in a substantial reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

risks related to our businesses other than the california utilities 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled be completed within budget or operate at expected levels which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the acquisition development construction and expansion of lng liquefaction marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels and lpg terminals and storage natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution infrastructure and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required 

to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built 

success in developing a project is contingent upon among other things 

 successful completion of a project may be materially adversely affected by among other factors 

 if we are unable to complete a development project or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of liquefaction regasification and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution infrastructure or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt liquefaction generation regasification storage transmission and distribution systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the design development and construction of the cameron lng liquefaction facility involves numerous risks and uncertainties 

with respect to our project to add lng export capability at the cameron lng facility cameron lng jv is building an lng export facility consisting of three liquefaction trains designed to a total nameplate capacity of 139 mtpa of lng with an expected export capability of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf per day if the estimated construction financing and other project costs for the facility exceed our contingency associated with the project budget adopted at the time of our final investment decision we may have to make additional unexpected cash contributions the majority of the investment in the liquefaction project is projectfinanced and the balance is provided by the project partners any failure by the project partners to make their required investments on a timely basis could result in project delays and could materially adversely affect the development of the project in addition sempra energy has guaranteed a maximum of up to 39 billion related to the project financing and financingrelated agreements these guarantees terminate upon cameron lng jv achieving “financial completion” of the initial threetrain liquefaction project including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests we anticipate that the guarantees will be terminated approximately nine months after all three trains achieve commercial operation if due to cameron lng jv’s failure to satisfy the financial completion criteria we are required to repay some or all of the 39 billion under our guarantees any such repayments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

largescale construction projects like the design development and construction of the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility involve numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the potential for unforeseen engineering challenges severe weather events substantial construction delays and increased costs cameron lng jv has a turnkey epc contract and if the contractor becomes unwilling or unable to perform according to the terms and timetable of the epc contract the project could 

face substantial construction delays and potentially significantly increased costs if the contractor’s delays or failures are serious enough to cause the contractor to default under the epc contract such default could result in cameron lng jv’s engagement of a substitute contractor based on a number of factors we believe it is reasonable to expect that cameron lng jv will start generating earnings in the middle of 2019 these factors include among others the terms of the settlement agreement entered into in december 2017 with the epc contractor to settle certain contractor’s claims the epc contractor’s progress to date the current commissioning activities the remaining work left to be performed the project schedules received from the epc contractor cameron lng jv’s own review of the project schedules the assumptions underlying such schedules and the inherent risks in constructing and testing facilities such as the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility the inability to complete the project in accordance with the current schedule cost overruns and the other risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition credit ratings andor prospects for additional discussion of the cameron lng jv and of these risks and other risks relating to the development of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project that could adversely affect our future performance see “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” 

we face many challenges to develop and complete our contemplated lng export facilities 

in addition to the threetrain cameron lng liquefaction facility described above we are looking at several other lng export terminal development opportunities including a greenfield project in port arthur texas two brownfield projects at our existing eca regasification facility in baja california mexico a midscale and largescale project and an expansion of up to two additional liquefaction trains at the cameron liquefaction facility each of these contemplated projects faces numerous risks and must overcome significant hurdles before we can proceed with construction common to all these projects is the risk that global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections could reduce the demand for natural gas in some sectors and cause a corresponding reduction in projected global demand for lng this could result in increased competition among those working on projects in an environment of declining lng demand such as the sempra energysponsored export initiatives such reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation which could also lead to increased competition among the lng suppliers for the declining lng demand at certain moderate levels oil prices could also make lng projects in other parts of the world still feasible and competitive with lng projects from north america thus increasing supply and the competition for the available lng demand a decline in natural gas prices outside the us which in many foreign countries are based on the price of crude oil may also materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices based on henry hub pricing 

sempra lng  midstream is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project near port arthur texas and is in discussions with the coowners of cameron lng jv regarding the potential expansion of the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility in addition sempra lng  midstream and ienova are jointly developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project at ienova’s existing eca regasification facility in mexico 

in june 2018 sempra lng  midstream selected bechtel as the epc contractor for the proposed port arthur liquefaction project bechtel is to perform the engineering execution planning and related activities necessary to prepare negotiate and finalize a definitive epc contract for the project the current arrangement with bechtel does not commit any party to enter into a definitive epc contract or otherwise participate in the project in december 2018 polish oil  gas company and port arthur lng entered into a definitive 20year agreement for the sale and purchase of 2 mtpa of lng per year from the port arthur lng liquefaction project this sale and purchase agreement is subject to conditions precedent including our positive final investment decision for the port arthur liquefaction project 

in november 2018 sempra energy and total sa entered into an mou that provides a framework for cooperation for the development of the potential eca liquefactionexport project and the potential cameron lng expansion project but does not obligate any of the parties to enter into definitive agreements or participate in the project the mou contemplates total sa potentially contracting for up to approximately 9 mtpa of lng offtake across these two development projects and provides total sa the option to acquire an equity interest in the proposed eca lng liquefaction facility project though the ultimate participation by total sa remains subject to finalization of definitive agreements among other factors 

in june 2018 we selected a technipfmc plc and kiewit corporation partnership as the epc contractor for the first phase of the potential eca liquefactionexport project eca lng phase1 the technipfmckiewit partnership is to perform the engineering planning and related activities necessary to prepare negotiate and finalize a definitive epc contract for eca lng phase 1 the current arrangement with the technipfmckiewit partnership does not commit any party to enter into a definitive epc contract or otherwise participate in the project 

in november 2018 sempra lng  midstream and ienova signed heads of agreements with affiliates of total sa mitsui  co ltd and tokyo gas co ltd for eca lng phase 1 we expect eca lng phase 1 to be a single train liquefaction facility located within the existing lng receipt terminal site with a capacity of approximately 24 mtpa of lng for export to global markets each heads of agreement for eca lng phase 1 contemplates the parties negotiating definitive 20year lng sales and 

purchase agreements for the purchase of approximately 08 mtpa of lng from the eca lng facility but does not obligate the parties to ultimately execute any agreements or participate in the project 

the ultimate participation of total sa mitsui  co ltd and tokyo gas co ltd in the potential eca lng project as contemplated by the heads of agreements remains subject to finalization of definitive agreements among other factors the development of the eca lng phase 1 and phase 2 projects is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including obtaining binding customer commitments the receipt of a number of permits and regulatory approvals obtaining financing negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including a definitive epc contract equity acquisition and governance agreements lng sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements reaching a final investment decision and other factors associated with this potential investment 

expansion of the cameron lng liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the joint venture project financing agreements including among others timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the project lenders under the cameron lng jv equity agreements the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all the partners including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner we expect that discussions on the potential expansion will continue among all the cameron lng jv members there can be no assurance that a mutually agreeable expansion structure will be agreed to unanimously by the cameron lng jv members which if not accomplished in a timely manner could materially and adversely impact the development of the expansion project in light of this we are unable to predict whether or when we andor cameron lng jv might be able to move forward on expansion of the cameron lng liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains 

any decisions by sempra energy or our potential counterparties to proceed with binding agreements with respect to the potential development or expansion of our liquefaction projects will require among other things obtaining customer commitments to purchase lng completion of project assessments and achieving other necessary internal and external approvals of each party in addition all our proposed projects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the receipt of a number of permits and approvals finding suitable partners and customers obtaining financing and incentives negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including equity acquisition and governance agreements natural gas supply and transportation agreements lng sale and purchase agreements and construction contracts and reaching a final investment decision 

furthermore there are a number of potential new projects under construction or in the process of development by various project developers in north america in addition to ours and given the projected global demand for lng the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed with respect to our port arthur texas project this is a greenfield site and therefore it may not have the advantages often associated with brownfield sites the eca facility in mexico is subject to ongoing land and permit disputes that could make project financing difficult as well as finding suitable partners and customers in addition while we have completed the regulatory process for an lng export facility in the us the regulatory process in mexico and the overlay of us regulations for natural gas exports to an lng export facility in mexico are not well developed there can be no assurance that such a facility could be permitted and constructed without facing significant legal challenges and uncertainties which in turn could make project financing as well as finding suitable partners and customers difficult finally eca has profitable longterm regasification contracts for 100 percent of the facility’s capacity through 2028 making the decision to pursue a new liquefaction facility dependent in part on whether the investment in a new liquefaction facility would over the long term be more beneficial than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts 

there can be no assurance that our contemplated lng export facilities will be completed and our inability to complete one or more of our contemplated lng export facilities could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows results of operations and prospects 

we discuss these projects further in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” 

domestic and international hydraulic fracturing operations are subject to political economic and other uncertainties that could increase the costs of doing business impose additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect production of lng and reduce or eliminate lng export opportunities and demand 

hydraulic fracturing operations in the us and outside the us face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to their operations several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations to impose more stringent permitting public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations in addition to state laws some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions such as city ordinances that may restrict the performance of or prohibit the well drilling in general andor hydraulic fracturing in particular hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions but federal agencies including the epa and the bureau of land management of the us department of the interior have asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities in addition the us congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the 

safe drinking water act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process there are also certain governmental reviews that have been conducted or are underway on deep shale and other formation completion and production practices including hydraulic fracturing depending on the outcome of these studies federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate or even ban such activities certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process in addition hydraulic fracturing operations may also be adversely affected directly or indirectly by laws policies and regulations of the us affecting foreign trade and taxation including us trade sanctions 

we cannot predict whether additional federal state local or international laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit if additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations natural gas prices in north america could rise which in turn could materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices based on henry hub pricing increased regulation or difficulty in permitting of hydraulic fracturing and any corresponding increase in domestic natural gas prices could materially adversely affect demand for lng exports and our ability to develop commercially viable lng export facilities beyond the threetrain cameron lng facility currently under construction 

our businesses are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices and our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks energyrelated commodity prices impact lng liquefaction and regasification the transport and storage of natural gas and power generation from renewable and conventional sources among other businesses that we operate and invest in 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for lng terminals or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas lng electricity or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions 

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated commodities result from multiple factors including 

 the ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates and over independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

when our businesses enter into fixedprice longterm contracts to provide services or commodities they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks 

sempra mexico and sempra lng  midstream generally endeavor to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure however if these contracts are at fixed prices the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures including rising operational costs costs of labor materials equipment and commodities and rising interest rates that affect financing costs we may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects providing for cost escalation providing for direct passthrough of operating costs or entering into hedges however these measures if implemented may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses andor financing costs the failure to fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

increased competition and changes in trade policies could materially adversely affect us 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors many of whom have extensive and diversified development andor operating experience including both domestic and international and financial resources similar to or greater than ours further in recent years the natural gas pipeline storage and lng market segments have been characterized by strong and increasing competition both with respect to winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets in mexico despite the commissioning of many new energy infrastructure projects by the cfe and other governmental agencies in connection with energy reforms competition for recent pipeline projects has been intense with numerous bidders competing aggressively for these projects there can be no assurance that we will be successful in bidding for new development opportunities in the us mexico or south america in addition as noted above there are a number of potential new lng liquefaction projects under construction or in the process of being developed by various project developers in north america including our contemplated new projects and given the projected global demand for lng it is likely that most of these projects will not be completed these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

in addition the current us administration has indicated its intention to revise or replace international trade agreements such as nafta in november 2018 president trump signed the usmca which if approved by the legislatures of the us mexico and canada would replace nafta a shift in us trade policies could materially adversely affect our lng development opportunities as well as opportunities for trade between mexico and the us 

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into extend or replace expiring longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition such longterm contracts once entered into increase our credit risk if our counterparties fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis due to bankruptcy insolvency or otherwise 

the eca lng facility has longterm capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties under these agreements customers pay capacity reservation and usage fees to receive store and regasify the customers’ lng we also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the eca lng facility were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

for the threetrain liquefaction facility currently under construction cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of total sa mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd that subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the facility if the counterparties to these tolling agreements were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations to cameron lng jv on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

sempra mexico’s and sempra lng  midstream’s ability to enter into or replace existing longterm firm capacity agreements for their natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include our lng facilities a significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility and we may be unable to sell the power that sempra renewables’ and sempra mexico’s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to perform we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses and the businesses that we invest in are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements or arrangements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements or arrangements should they fail to perform we may be 

required to enter into alternative arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such an event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition many such agreements are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses the failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects finally we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

sempra mexico’s and sempra lng  midstream’s obligations and those of their suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for “force majeure” events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

in addition we may develop andor own some projects with other equity owners and therefore we may not control all material decisions with respect to those projects as is the case with the cameron lng jv project to the extent that there is disagreement amongst the project equity owners with respect to certain decisions affecting such a project then the development construction or operation of such project may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected such a circumstance could materially adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows result of operations andor prospects 

our businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits 

we are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties adjacent to and properties where our eca lng regasification terminal in mexico is located as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements if we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which our eca lng terminal is located we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such terminal in addition our ability to convert the eca lng regasification terminal into an lng liquefaction export facility may be hindered or halted by these disputes and they could make project financing such a facility and finding suitable partners and customers very difficult if we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

we rely on transportation assets and services much of which we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to 

 sempra mexico and sempra lng  midstream also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra mexico and sempra lng  midstream also rely on specialized ships to transport lng to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities sempra renewables sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities electricity and other services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity natural gas supplies and lng at thencurrent spot market rates which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges 

in mexico we own or have interests in natural gas distribution and transportation lpg storage and transportation facilities ethane transportation assets electricity generation facilities and lng ethane and liquid fuels marine and inland terminals in peru and chile we own or have interests in electric transmission distribution and generation infrastructure and operations developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant security political legal regulatory and financial risks that vary by country including 



 our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could materially reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries we may or may not choose to hedge these risks and any hedges entered into may or may not be effective fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in significantly increased taxes in foreign countries and materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

we discuss litigation related to sempra mexico’s international energy projects in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

risks related to our interest in oncor 

sempra energy could incur substantial tax liabilities if efh’s 2016 spinoff of vistra from efh is deemed to be taxable 

as part of its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings in 2016 efh distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary vistra energy corp formerly tceh corp and referred to herein as vistra to certain creditors of tceh llc the spinoff and vistra became an independent publicly traded company vistra’s spinoff from efh was intended to qualify for partially taxfree treatment to efh and its stockholders under sections 368a1g 355 and 356 of the irc collectively referred to as the intended tax treatment in connection with and as a condition to the spinoff efh received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain issues relating to the intended tax treatment of the spinoff as well as tax opinions from counsel to efh and vistra regarding certain aspects of the spinoff not covered by the private letter ruling 

in connection with the signing and closing of the merger efh sought and received a supplemental private letter ruling from the irs and sempra energy and efh received tax opinions from their respective counsel that generally provide that the merger will not affect the conclusions reached in respectively the irs private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spinoff described above similar to the irs private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spinoff the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs and any opinions issued with respect to the merger are based on factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by sempra energy and efh now sempra texas holdings corp and a subsidiary of sempra energy if such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete any such undertakings are not complied with or the facts upon which the irs supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions which will not impact the irs position on the transactions are based are different from the actual facts relating to the merger the tax opinions andor supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and as a result could be successfully challenged by the irs if it is determined that the merger causes the spinoff not to qualify for the intended tax treatment sempra energy through its ownership of sempra texas holdings corp could incur substantial tax liabilities which would materially reduce and potentially eliminate the value associated with our indirect investment in oncor and could have a material adverse effect on the results of 

operations financial condition andor prospects of sempra energy and on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities should the irs invalidate the private letter ruling andor the supplemental private letter ruling sempra texas holdings corp has administrative appeal rights including the right to challenge any adverse irs position in court 

failure by oncor to successfully execute its business strategy and objectives may materially adversely affect sempra energy’s future results and consequently the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

the success of the merger will depend in part on the ability of oncor to successfully execute its business strategy including several objectives that are capital intensive and to respond to challenges in the electric utility industry see below under “oncor’s operations are capital intensive and it could have liquidity needs that may require us to make additional investments in oncor” if oncor is not able to achieve these objectives is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis or otherwise fails to perform in accordance with our expectations the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all and the merger may materially adversely affect sempra energy’s results of operations financial condition and prospects of sempra energy and consequently the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

we may issue a significant amount of equity securities to reduce our indebtedness incurred in connection with the merger which may dilute the economic and voting interests of our current shareholders and may adversely affect the market value of our common stock and preferred stock 

in 2018 we issued a significant amount of equity securities to raise proceeds to fund a significant portion of the merger consideration and associated transaction costs and to reduce our indebtedness as of february 26 2019 16906185 shares remain subject to future settlement under forward sale agreements which may be settled on one or more dates specified by us occurring no later than december 15 2019 which is the final settlement date under the agreements although we expect to settle the forward sale agreements entirely by the physical delivery of shares of our common stock in exchange for cash proceeds we may subject to certain conditions elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreements the forward sale agreements are also subject to acceleration by the forward purchasers upon the occurrence of certain events 

in addition in january 2018 we issued 17250000 shares of our 6 mandatory convertible preferred stock series a the “series a preferred stock” and in july 2018 we issued 5750000 shares of our 675 mandatory convertible preferred stock series b the “series b preferred stock” both of which we expect will ultimately convert into common stock some of these equity issuances including common stock issued upon settlement of the forward sale agreements will likely occur in connection with the repayment of outstanding indebtedness including indebtedness we have incurred in connection with the merger see below under “we incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the merger as a result it may be more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts or take other actions and we may need to divert cash to fund debt service payments” although the issuance of any equity securities is subject to market conditions and other factors many of which are beyond our control and we may in fact issue fewer shares of any equity securities than anticipated the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock including shares issued upon conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock and settlement of the forward sale agreements will have the effect and the issuance of additional equity securities may have the effect of diluting the economic and voting interests of our common shareholders in addition the issuance of additional shares of common stock including shares issued upon conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock and settlement of the forward sale agreements without a commensurate increase in our consolidated earnings would dilute and the issuance of additional equity securities could dilute our earnings per common share any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 

we incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the merger as a result it may be more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts or take other actions and we may need to divert cash to fund debt service payments 

we incurred significant additional indebtedness to finance a portion of the merger consideration and associated transaction costs in january 2018 we issued 5 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed and variablerate notes in various series that mature between 2019 and 2048 and we issued approximately 26 billion of commercial paper in february 2018 and march 2018 the oncor merger commercial paper to fund a portion of the merger consideration and associated transaction costs we have since repaid the oncor merger commercial paper with proceeds from equity issuances and newly issued commercial paper our debt service obligations resulting from our aggregate indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s results of operations financial condition and prospects by among other things 



 the merger substantially increased our debt service obligations and in light of the ringfencing arrangements described below under “certain ringfencing measures existing governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management and policies of oncor” there can be no assurance that we will receive any cash from oncor to assist us in servicing our indebtedness paying dividends on our common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock or meeting our other cash needs which may have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

we are committed to maintaining our credit ratings at investment grade to maintain these credit ratings we may consider it appropriate to reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness we may seek to reduce this indebtedness with the proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of common stock and possibly other equity securities and the settlement of sales of our common stock pursuant to our forward sale agreements cash from operations and proceeds from asset sales which may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our common stock however the issuance of any equity securities is subject to market conditions and other factors many of which are beyond our control there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities on terms that we consider acceptable or at all or that we will be able to reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness should we elect to do so to a level that permits us to maintain our investment grade credit ratings which may have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

certain ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management and policies of oncor 

various “ringfencing” measures are in place to enhance oncor’s separateness from its owners and to mitigate the risk that oncor would be negatively impacted in the event of a bankruptcy or other adverse financial developments affecting its owners this ringfence creates both legal and financial separation between oncor holdings oncor and their subsidiaries on the one hand and sempra energy and its affiliates and subsidiaries on the other hand 

in accordance with the ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments we made in connection with the merger we and oncor are subject to various restrictions including among others 



 as a result of the ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and commitments we do not control oncor holdings or oncor and we have limited ability to direct the management policies and operations of oncor holdings and oncor including the deployment or disposition of their assets declarations of dividends strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions we have limited representation on the oncor holdings and oncor board of directors which are controlled by independent directors the existence of the ringfencing measures and other limitations may increase our costs of financing further the oncor directors have considerable autonomy and as described in our commitments have a duty to act in the best interest of oncor consistent with the approved ringfence and delaware law which may be contrary to our best interests or be in opposition to our preferred strategic direction for oncor to the extent that they take actions that are not in our interests the financial condition results of operations andor prospects of sempra energy may be materially adversely affected 

if oncor fails to respond to challenges in the electric utility industry including changes in regulation its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and this could materially adversely affect us 

because oncor is regulated by both us federal and texas state authorities it has been and will continue to be affected by legislative and regulatory developments the costs and burdens associated with complying with these regulatory requirements and adjusting oncor’s business to legislative and regulatory developments may have a material adverse effect on oncor moreover potential legislative changes regulatory changes or other market or industry changes may create greater risks to the predictability of utility earnings generally if oncor does not successfully respond to these changes it could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations financial condition andor prospects which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition andor prospects 

oncor’s operations are capital intensive and it could have liquidity needs that may require us to make additional investments in oncor 

oncor’s business is capital intensive and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements in the past oncor has financed a substantial portion of its cash needs with the proceeds from indebtedness in the event that oncor fails to meet its capital requirements we may be required to make additional investments in oncor similarly if oncor is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs we may elect to make additional investments in oncor which could be substantial and which would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition andor prospects in that regard our commitments to the puct prohibit us from making loans to oncor as a result if oncor requires additional financing and cannot obtain it from other sources we may be required to make a capital contribution rather than a loan to oncor 

settlement provisions contained in our equity forward sale agreements subject us to certain risks 

the counterparties to the january forward sale agreements and the july forward sale agreements collectively the forward purchasers have the right to accelerate their respective forward sale agreements or in certain cases the portion thereof that they determine is affected by the relevant event and require us to physically settle such forward sale agreements on a date specified by the forward purchasers if 

 the forward purchasers’ decision to exercise their right to accelerate the forward sale agreements or in certain cases the portion thereof that they determine is affected by the relevant event and to require us to settle the forward sale agreements will be made irrespective of our interests including our need for capital in such cases we could be required to issue and deliver our common stock under the terms of the physical settlement provisions of the forward sale agreements irrespective of our capital needs which would result in dilution to our eps and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock our mandatory convertible preferred stock any other equity that we may issue and our debt securities 

the forward sale agreements provide for settlement on a settlement date or dates to be specified at our discretion but which we expect to occur in one or more additional settlements on or prior to december 15 2019 subject to the provisions of the forward sale agreements delivery of our shares upon physical or net share settlement of the forward sale agreements will result in dilution to our eps and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock mandatory convertible preferred stock and any other equity that we may issue 

we may elect subject to certain conditions cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreements if we conclude that it is in our interest to do so for example we may conclude that it is in our interest to cash settle or net share settle the forward sale agreements if we otherwise have no current use for all or a portion of the net proceeds due upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements 

if we elect to cash or net share settle all or a portion of the shares of our common stock underlying the forward sale agreements we would expect the forward purchasers or one of their affiliates to purchase the number of shares necessary based on the number of shares with respect to which we have elected cash or net share settlement in order to satisfy their obligation to return the shares of our common stock they had borrowed in connection with sales of our common stock related to each underlying stock offering and if applicable in connection with net share settlement to deliver shares of our common stock to us or take into account shares of our common stock to be delivered by us as applicable the purchase of our common stock by the forward purchasers or their affiliates to unwind the forward purchasers’ hedge positions could cause the price of our common stock to increase over time thereby increasing the amount of cash or the number of shares of our common stock that we would owe to the forward purchasers upon cash settlement or net share settlement as the case may be of the forward sale agreements or decreasing the amount of cash 

or the number of shares of our common stock that the forward purchasers owe us upon cash settlement or net share settlement as the case may be of the forward sale agreements 

dividend requirements associated with the mandatory convertible preferred stock sempra energy issued in connection with the merger subject us to certain risks 

any future payments of cash dividends and the amount of any cash dividends we pay on our series a preferred stock and our series b preferred stock will depend on among other things our financial condition capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries and investments to distribute cash to us as well as other factors that our board of directors or an authorized committee thereof may consider relevant any failure to pay scheduled dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock when due would likely have a material adverse impact on the market price of our mandatory convertible preferred stock our common stock and our debt securities and would prohibit us under the terms of the mandatory convertible preferred stock from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of our common stock subject to limited exceptions until such time as we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the mandatory convertible preferred stock 

the terms of the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock provide that if dividends on any shares of the mandatory convertible preferred stock i have not been declared and paid or ii have been declared but a sum of cash or number of shares of our common stock sufficient for payment thereof has not been set aside for the benefit of the holders thereof on the applicable record date in each case for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods whether or not for consecutive dividend periods the holders of shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other classes or series of our preferred stock ranking equally with the mandatory convertible preferred stock either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation dissolution or windingup and having similar voting rights will be entitled to elect a total of two additional members of our board of directors subject to certain terms and limitations described in the certificate of determination applicable to the mandatory convertible preferred stock 

other risks 

sempra energy has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control 

sempra energy makes investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control as described above sdge holds a 20 percent ownership interest in songs which is in the process of being decommissioned by edison its majority owner as a result of ringfencing measures existing governance mechanisms and commitments we account for our indirect 100percent ownership interest in oncor holdings which owns an 8025 percent interest in oncor as an equity method investment which investment is 9652 million at december 31 2018 sempra lng  midstream accounts for its investment in the cameron lng jv under the equity method which investment is 1271 million at december 31 2018  at december 31 2018  sempra renewables had investments totaling 291 million in several jvs to operate wind generation facilities sempra mexico has a 40percent interest in a jv with a subsidiary of transcanada to build own and operate the sur de texastuxpan natural gas marine pipeline in mexico a 50 percent interest in a renewables wind project in baja california  and a 50percent interest in the los ramones norte pipeline in mexico at december 31 2018  these various jv investments by sempra mexico totaled 747 million  sempra energy has an equity method investment in the rbs sempra commodities partnership which is in the process of being dissolved and for which sempra energy is subject to certain indemnities as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements any adverse resolution of matters associated with our remaining investment in the rbs sempra commodities partnership could have a corresponding impact on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

sempra energy committed to make a capital contribution to oncor for oncor to fund its acquisition of infrareit which acquisition we expect will close in mid2019 we estimate the capital contribution to be 1025 million excluding our share of the approximately 40 million for a management agreement termination fee as well as other customary transaction costs incurred by infrareit that would be borne by oncor as part of the acquisition the capital contribution is contingent on the satisfaction of customary conditions including the substantially simultaneous closing of the transactions contemplated by the infrareit merger agreement we discuss these transactions in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 mda – factors influencing future performance” 

sempra mexico and sempra lng  midstream have provided guarantees related to jv financing agreements and sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico have provided loans to jvs in which they have investments and to other affiliates we discuss the guarantees in note 6 and affiliate loans in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have limited influence over these ventures and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest in addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the 

businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we discuss our investments further in notes 5 6 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

market performance or changes in other assumptions could require sempra energy sdge andor socalgas to make significant unplanned contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees a decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans in addition the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors including the assumed rate of return on plan assets employee demographics discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations rates of increase in health care costs levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation an adverse change in any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

impairment of goodwill would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

as of december 31 2018 sempra energy had approximately 24 billion of goodwill which represented approximately 39 percent of the total assets on its consolidated balance sheet primarily related to the acquisitions of ienova pipelines and ventika in mexico chilquinta energía in chile and luz del sur in peru goodwill is not amortized but we test it for impairment annually on october 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation which could result in our recording a goodwill impairment loss we discuss our annual goodwill impairment testing process and the factors considered in such testing in “item 7 mda – critical accounting policies and estimates” and in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements a goodwill impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which such charge is recorded

changes in revenues costs and earnings 

this section contains a discussion of the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of operations for sempra energy sdge and socalgas 

utilities revenues 

our utilities revenues include 

electric revenues at 

 natural gas revenues at 

 intercompany revenues included in the separate revenues of each utility are eliminated in the sempra energy consolidated statements of operations 

socalgas and sdge currently operate under a regulatory framework that 



through rates 

 because changes in sdge’s and socalgas’ cost of electricity andor natural gas are substantially recovered in rates changes in these costs are offset in the changes in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings in addition to the changes in cost or market prices electric or natural gas revenues recorded during a period are impacted by customer billing cycles causing a difference between customer billings and recorded or authorized costs these differences are required to be balanced over time resulting in over and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts we discuss balancing accounts and their effects further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

as part of our central risk management function we enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge sempra mexico parent’s exposure to movements in the mexican peso from its controlling interest in ienova the gainslosses associated with these derivatives are included in other income net as described below and partially mitigate the transactional effects of foreign currency and inflation included in income taxes and in earnings from sempra mexico’s equity method investments we discuss policies governing our risk management in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” below 

other income net decreased by 161 million to 72 million in 2018 primarily due to 

 in 2017 compared to 2016  other income net increased by 95 million  69  to 233 million and included the following activity 

 we provide further details of the components of other income net in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the table below shows the income tax expense and etrs for sempra energy sdge and socalgas 



 

on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law as discussed below we recorded additional income tax expense of 870 million from the effects of the tcja in 2017 which significantly impacts our following comparisons of income tax expense from 2018 to 2017 and 2017 to 2016 

following are the key provisions of the tcja that impact us 

 we recorded the effects of the tcja in 2017 using our best estimates and the information available to us through the date those financial statements were issued in 2018 we adjusted our 2017 provisional estimates and completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja as permitted by asu 201805 which we describe in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we discuss these 2017 tcja impacts and related 2018 provisional adjustments further in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have not recorded deferred income taxes with respect to remaining basis differences of approximately 1 billion between financial statement and income tax investment amounts in our nonus subsidiaries because we consider them to be indefinitely reinvested as of december 31 2018 it is currently not practicable to determine the hypothetical amount of tax that might be payable if the underlying basis differences were realized on january 25 2019 our board of directors approved a plan to sell our south american businesses as we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we are evaluating the effects of the planned sale on our indefinite reinvestment assertion and expect to record any impacts to our tax provision in the first quarter of 2019 

sempra energy consolidated 

sempra energy’s income tax expense decreased in 2018 due to a lower etr and lower pretax income pretax income in 2018 was impacted by the impairments at our sempra lng  midstream and sempra renewables segments offset by the gain from the sale of assets at sempra renewables while the pretax income in 2017 was impacted by the writeoff of sdge’s wildfire regulatory asset the lower etr was primarily due to 

 sempra energy’s income tax expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a higher etr partially offset by lower pretax income the higher etr was primarily due to 

 we report as part of our pretax results the income or loss attributable to nci however we do not record income taxes for a portion of this income or loss as some of our entities with nci are currently treated as partnerships for income tax purposes and thus we are only liable for income taxes on the portion of the earnings that are allocated to us our pretax income however includes 100 percent of these entities as our entities with nci grow and as we may continue to invest in such entities the impact on our etr may become more significant 

sdge 

sdge’s income tax expense increased in 2018 due to higher pretax income partially offset by a lower etr the pretax income in 2017 included the 351 million 208 million after tax writeoff of the wildfire regulatory asset the lower etr was primarily due to 



sdge’s income tax expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower pretax income and a lower etr the pretax income in 2017 included the 351 million 208 million after tax writeoff of wildfire regulatory asset the lower etr was primarily due to 

 socalgas 

socalgas’ income tax expense decreased in 2018 due to lower pretax income and a lower etr the lower etr was primarily due to 

 socalgas’ income tax expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher pretax income 

peruvian tax legislation 

in december 2016 the peruvian president through a presidential decree enacted income tax law changes that became effective on january 1 2017 among other changes the new law imposed an increase in the corporate income tax rate from 28 percent in 2016 to 295 percent in 2017 and beyond as well as a decrease in the dividend withholding tax rate from 68 percent in 2016 to 5 percent in 2017 and beyond as a result of the increase to the peruvian corporate income tax rate to 295 percent we remeasured our peruvian deferred income tax balances resulting in 17 million income tax expense recorded in 2016 

equity earnings 

equity earnings increased by  100 million to 176 million in 2018 primarily due to 

 the decrease of 8 million to 76 million in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to 

 earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

earnings attributable to nci were 76 million for 2018 compared to 94 million for 2017  the net change of 18 million included 



earnings attributable to nci were 94 million for 2017 compared to 148 million for 2016  the net change of 54 million included 

 mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends 

in the year ended december 31 2018 our board of directors declared dividends of 105 million and 20 million respectively on our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock 

transactions with affiliates 

we provide information about our related party transactions in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations 

because our operations in south america and our natural gas distribution utility in mexico use their local currency as their functional currency revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates for the period for consolidation in sempra energy consolidated’s results of operations 

foreign currency translation 

any difference in average exchange rates used for the translation of income statement activity from year to year can cause a variance in sempra energy’s comparative results of operations changes in foreign currency translation rates between years resulted in a negligible impact in 2018 compared to 2017 and 6 million higher earnings at sempra south american utilities in 2017 compared to 2016 

transactional impacts 

some income statement activities at our foreign operations and their jvs are also impacted by transactional gains and losses which we discuss below a summary of these foreign currency transactional gains and losses included in our reported results is as follows 





foreign currency exchange rate and inflation impacts on income taxes and related hedging activity 

our mexican subsidiaries have us dollardenominated cash balances receivables payables and debt monetary assets and liabilities that are affected by mexican currency exchange rate movements for mexican income tax purposes they also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are significant denominated in the mexican peso that must be translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes in addition monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes as a result fluctuations in both the currency exchange rate for the mexican peso against the us dollar and mexican inflation may expose us to fluctuations in income tax expense other income net and equity earnings we use foreign currency derivatives as a means to manage exposure to the currency exchange rate on our monetary assets and liabilities however we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities which makes us susceptible to volatility in income tax expense caused by exchange rate fluctuations and inflation the derivative activity impacts other income net 

the income tax expense of our south american subsidiaries is similarly impacted by inflation and currency exchange rate movements related to us dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities 

other transactions 

although the financial statements of most of our mexican subsidiaries and jvs energía sierra juárez and img have the us dollar as the functional currency some transactions may be denominated in the local currency such transactions are remeasured into us dollars this remeasurement creates transactional gains and losses that are included in other income net for our consolidated subsidiaries and in equity earnings for our jvs including ienova pipelines until september 26 2016 and den until november 15 2017 

we utilize crosscurrency swaps that exchange our mexican pesodenominated principal and interest payments into the us dollar and swap mexican variable interest rates for us fixed interest rates the impacts of these crosscurrency swaps are offset in oci and are reclassified from aoci into earnings through interest expense as settlements occur 

certain of our mexican pipeline projects namely los ramones i at ienova pipelines and los ramones norte within our tag jv generate revenue based on tariffs that are set by government agencies in mexico with contracts denominated in mexican pesos that are indexed to the us dollar adjusted annually for inflation and fluctuation in the exchange rate the resultant gains and losses from remeasuring the local currency amounts into us dollars and the settlement of foreign currency forwards and swaps related to these contracts are included in revenues energyrelated businesses or equity earnings 

our jvs in chile eletrans use the us dollar as the functional currency but have certain construction commitments that are denominated in clf eletrans entered into forward exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exchange risk of the clf relative to the us dollar the forward exchange contracts settle based on anticipated payments to vendors generally monthly and ended in 2018 with activity recorded in equity earnings 



capital resources and liquidity 

overview 

we expect to meet our cash requirements through cash flows from operations unrestricted cash and cash equivalents proceeds from recent and planned asset sales borrowings under our credit facilities distributions from our equity method investments issuances of debt and equity securities project financing and other equity sales including partnering jvs 

our lines of credit provide liquidity and support commercial paper as we discuss in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sempra energy sempra global and the california utilities each have fiveyear revolving credit facilities expiring in 2020 the table below shows the amount of available funds including available unused credit on these three credit facilities at december 31 2018  our foreign operations had additional general purpose credit facilities aggregating 18 billion  with approximately 08 billion available unused credit at december 31 2018  



 sempra energy consolidated 

we believe that these available funds combined with cash flows from operations proceeds from recent and planned asset sales distributions from our equity method investments issuances of debt and equity securities project financing and other equity sales including partnering in jvs will be adequate to fund our current operations including to 

 sempra energy and the california utilities currently have ready access to the longterm debt markets and are not currently constrained in their ability to borrow at reasonable rates however changing economic conditions and our financing activities could negatively affect the availability and cost of both shortterm and longterm financing also cash flows from operations may be impacted by the timing of commencement and completion of large projects if cash flows from operations were to be significantly reduced or we were unable to borrow under acceptable terms we would likely first reduce or postpone discretionary capital expenditures not related to safety and investments in new businesses if these measures were necessary they would primarily impact our sempra mexico and sempra lng  midstream businesses before we would reduce funds necessary for the ongoing needs of our utilities we used the 16 billion in cash proceeds received from sempra renewables’ sale to a subsidiary of con ed which we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements to temporarily pay down commercial paper pending the close of oncor’s and our agreements to purchase infrareit and a 50percent interest in sharyland holdings lp respectively as described below we monitor our ability to finance the needs of our operating investing and financing activities in a manner consistent with our intention to maintain our investmentgrade credit ratings and capital structure  

we have significant investments in several trusts to provide for future payments of pensions and other postretirement benefits and nuclear decommissioning changes in asset values which are dependent on the activity in the equity and fixed income markets have not affected the trust funds’ abilities to make required payments however changes in asset values along with a number of other factors such as changes to discount rates assumed rates of return mortality tables and regulations may impact funding requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and sdge’s ndt at the california utilities funding requirements are generally recoverable in rates 

we discuss matters regarding sempra energy sdge and socalgas common stock dividends below in “dividends” 

shortterm borrowings 

we use shortterm debt primarily to meet liquidity requirements fund shareholder dividends and temporarily finance capital expenditures acquisitions or startups our corporate shortterm unsecured promissory notes or commercial paper were our primary sources of shortterm debt funding in 2018  our california utilities use shortterm debt primarily to meet working capital needs 

the following table shows selected statistics for our commercial paper borrowings for 2018  



 impacts of the tcja 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded the effects of the tcja resulting in an increase to income tax expense of 870 million at sempra energy consolidated in 2018 we recorded 85 million income tax expense when we adjusted our 2017 provisional estimates although there was no cash impact in 2017 or 2018 these effects represent potential future tax payments or other cash outflow and in the case of sdge and socalgas the remeasurement of their us federal deferred income tax balances will result in cash outflow primarily for refunds to ratepayers in the future we used a portion of our existing nols to offset the deemed repatriation tax 

certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies such as our funds from operationstodebt percentage could be negatively impacted as a result of certain provisions of the tcja and in particular by an anticipated decrease in income tax reimbursement payments to us from sdge and socalgas due the reduction in the us statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 percent 

certain provisions of the tcja such as 100percent expensing of capital expenditures and impacts on utilization of our nols may also influence how we fund capital expenditures the timing of capital expenditures and possible redeployment of capital through sales or monetization of assets the timing of repatriation of foreign earnings and the use of equity financing to reduce our future use of debt 

as we discuss in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and above in “changes in revenues costs and earnings – income taxes” our analysis and interpretation of the effects of the tcja and our assessment of strategies to manage the cash and earnings impacts on our businesses are ongoing 

loans tofrom affiliates 

at december 31 2018  sempra energy has outstanding loans to unconsolidated affiliates totaling 688 million and a 37 million loan from an unconsolidated affiliate which we discuss in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

california utilities 

sdge and socalgas expect that the available unused credit described above cash flows from operations and debt issuances will continue to be adequate to fund their respective operations the california utilities manage their capital structure and pay dividends when appropriate and as approved by their respective boards of directors 

as we discuss in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements changes in balancing accounts for significant costs at sdge and socalgas particularly a change between over and undercollected status may have a significant impact on cash flows as these changes generally represent the difference between when costs are incurred and when they are ultimately recovered in rates through billings to customers 

sdge’s and socalgas’ balancing accounts include some or all of the following 



consumption compared to authorized levels sdge’s cfca balance was undercollected by 51 million and 26 million at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively and socalgas’ cfca balance was undercollected by 177 million and 164 million at december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively 

sdge 

sdge has a tolling agreement to purchase power generated at omec a 605mw generating facility a related agreement provided sdge with the option to purchase omec at a predetermined price referred to as the call option sdge’s call option has expired unexercised under the terms of the agreement omec llc can require sdge to purchase the power plant for 280 million subject to adjustments on or before october 3 2019 referred to as the put option or upon earlier termination of the ppa 

in october 2018 sdge and omec llc signed a resource adequacy capacity agreement for a term that would commence at the expiration of the current tolling agreement in october 2019 and end in august 2024 the capacity agreement was approved by omec llc’s lenders in december 2018 but is contingent upon receiving final and nonappealable approval from the cpuc before the expiration of the put option on april 1 2019 if a timely final and nonappealable approval of the resource adequacy capacity agreement is received omec llc will waive its right to exercise the put option and as a result sdge would no longer consolidate otay mesa vie sdge received cpuc approval of the resource adequacy capacity agreement in february 2019 and the period for appeal expires on march 25 2019 

socalgas 

aliso canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak 

we provide information on the natural gas leak at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “factors influencing future performance” below and in “item 1a risk factors” the costs of defending against the related civil and criminal lawsuits and cooperating with related investigations and any damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines costs and other penalties if awarded or imposed as well as costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible such amounts could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations also higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas as a result of new laws orders rules and regulations arising out of this incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable in customer rates which may have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

the costs incurred to remediate and stop the leak and to mitigate local community impacts are significant and may increase and to the extent not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible such amounts could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

sempra texas utility 

acquisition of oncor holdings 

as we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on march 9 2018 sempra energy completed transactions resulting in the acquisition of an indirect ownership of an 8025percent interest in oncor for a total purchase price paid of 957 billion including merger consideration of 945 billion 

as we discuss in notes 7  13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements our registered public offerings of common stock not including shares offered pursuant to forward sale agreements series a preferred stock and longterm debt completed in january 2018 provided total initial net proceeds of approximately 70 billion for partial funding of the merger consideration of which approximately 800 million was used to pay down commercial paper pending the closing of the merger 

in march 2018 to fund a portion of the merger consideration we issued approximately 900 million net of underwriting discounts of common equity through settlement of forward sales under the forward sale agreements and raised the remaining portion of the merger consideration through issuances of approximately 26 billion in commercial paper with a weightedaverage maturity of 47 days and a weightedaverage interest rate of 22 percent per annum 

upon closing of the merger our funding of the total purchase price was comprised of approximately 31 percent equity and approximately 69 percent debt which does not include shares that have since been settled and that we expect to settle in our common stock pursuant to forward sale agreements we intend to ultimately fund the total purchase price with approximately 65 percent equity and approximately 35 percent debt 

in june 2018 we issued approximately 800 million net of underwriting discounts of common equity through settlement of forward sales under the forward sale agreements and used the proceeds from these settlements to repay longterm debt maturing in june 2018 and to repay commercial paper used to fund a portion of the merger consideration 

in july 2018 we raised additional net proceeds of approximately 729 million through sales of 565 million of series b preferred stock and 164 million of common stock not including shares offered pursuant to forward sale agreements 

the january 2018 and july 2018 forward sale agreements permit us to elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreements we expect to settle the forward sale agreements entirely by the physical delivery of shares of our common stock in exchange for cash proceeds as of february 26 2019  at the initial forward sale price of approximately 10507 per share in january 2018 and approximately 11187 per share in july 2018 we expect that the net proceeds from full physical settlement of the remaining forward sale agreements would be approximately 18 billion net of underwriting discounts but before deducting equity issuance costs and subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the forward sale agreements assuming physical settlement of all outstanding forward sales agreements we will have achieved funding the total purchase price with approximately 65 percent equity 

if we do not physically settle all the forward settlement agreements we may use cash from operations and proceeds from asset sales in place of some equity financing some of the equity financing subsequent to the merger including proceeds we receive from the settlement of the remaining portion of our forward sale agreements and from other sales of common stock may be used to repay indebtedness incurred to finance a portion of the total purchase price if we were to elect cash settlement or net share settlement the amount of cash proceeds we receive upon settlement would differ perhaps substantially or we may not receive any cash proceeds or we may deliver cash in an amount which could be significant or shares of our common stock to the forward purchasers we expect to settle the remaining portion of the forward sale agreements in one or more settlements no later than december 15 2019 which is the final settlement date under the agreements 

oncor’s business is capital intensive and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements in the past oncor has financed a substantial portion of its cash needs with the proceeds from indebtedness in the event that oncor fails to meet its capital requirements we may be required to make additional investments in oncor or if oncor is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs we may elect to make additional investments in oncor which could be substantial and which would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects in that regard our commitments to the puct prohibit us from making loans to oncor as a result if oncor requires additional financing and cannot obtain it from other sources we may be required to make a capital contribution rather than a loan to oncor 

commensurate with our ownership interest we contributed to oncor 230 million in cash in 2018 in 2018 oncor’s board of directors declared dividends of 209 million of which 167 million is oncor holdings’ commensurate share in 2018 oncor holdings distributed the 167 million to sempra energy in the form of dividends of 149 million and tax sharing payments of 18 million 

in february 2019 oncor’s board of directors declared dividends of 71 million and oncor holdings’ board of directors declared dividends of 54 million in february 2019 sempra energy contributed 56 million to oncor 

we provide additional discussion regarding the merger and financing risks below in “factors influencing future performance” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

on october 18 2018 sempra energy committed to make a capital contribution to oncor for oncor to fund its acquisition of infrareit which acquisition we expect will close in mid2019 we estimate the capital contribution to be 1025 million excluding our share of approximately 40 million for a management agreement termination fee as well as other customary transaction costs incurred by infrareit that would be borne by oncor as part of the acquisition the capital contribution is contingent on the satisfaction of customary conditions including the substantially simultaneous closing of the transactions contemplated by the infrareit merger agreement we discuss these transactions in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and below in “factors influencing future performance” 

sempra south american utilities 

we expect to fund operations at chilquinta energía and luz del sur and dividends at luz del sur with available funds including credit facilities funds internally generated by those businesses issuances of corporate bonds and other external borrowings 

on january 25 2019 our board of directors approved a plan to market and sell our south american businesses we expect to complete the sales process by the end of 2019 

sempra mexico 

we expect to fund operations and dividends at ienova with available funds including credit facilities and funds internally generated by the sempra mexico businesses as well as funds from ienova’s securities issuances project financing interim funding from the parent or affiliates and partnering in jvs 

in 2018 2017 and 2016 ienova paid dividends of 71 million 67 million and 26 million respectively to its minority shareholders 

ienova’s shareholders approved the formation of a fund for ienova to repurchase its own shares of common stock for a maximum amount of 250 million in us dollars in 2018 repurchases shall not exceed ienova’s total net profits including retained earnings as stated in their 2017 financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2018 ienova repurchased 2000000 shares of its outstanding common stock held by nci for approximately 7 million  resulting in an increase in sempra energy’s ownership interest in ienova from 664 percent to 665 percent  in february 2019 ienova repurchased an additional 1600000 shares for approximately 6 million  

sempra renewables 

as we discuss in notes 5 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and below in “factors influencing future performance” on june 25 2018 our board of directors approved a plan to sell our entire portfolio of us wind and us solar assets in december 2018 sempra renewables completed the sale of all its operating solar assets its solar and battery storage development projects and one wind generation facility for 16 billion in february 2019 sempra renewables entered into an agreement to sell its remaining wind assets and investments for 551 million subject to working capital adjustments and customary closing conditions we expect to complete the sale in the second quarter of 2019 

sempra lng  midstream 

on february 7 2019 sempra lng  midstream completed the sale of its nonutility natural gas storage assets in the southeast us comprised of mississippi hub and bay gas to an affiliate of arclight capital partners sempra lng  midstream received cash proceeds of 328 million subject to working capital adjustments and sempra lng  midstream’s purchase for 20 million of the 91percent minority interest in bay gas immediately prior to and included as part of the sale which we discuss in “item 1 business” and in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we expect sempra lng  midstream to require funding for the development and expansion of its remaining portfolio of projects which may be financed through a combination of operating cash flow funding from the parent project financing and partnering in jvs 

sempra lng  midstream through its interest in cameron lng jv is developing a natural gas liquefaction export facility at the cameron lng jv terminal the majority of the current threetrain liquefaction project is projectfinanced with most or all of the remainder of the capital requirements to be provided by the project partners including sempra energy through equity contributions under the project equity agreements we expect that our remaining equity requirements to complete the project will be met by a combination of our share of cash generated from each liquefaction train as it comes on line and additional cash contributions sempra energy signed guarantees for 502 percent of cameron lng jv’s obligations under the financing agreements for a maximum amount of up to 39 billion the project financing and guarantees became effective on october 1 2014 the effective date of the jv formation the guarantees will terminate upon satisfaction of certain conditions including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests we anticipate that the guarantees will be terminated approximately nine months after all three trains achieve commercial operation 

we discuss cameron lng jv and the jv financing further in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements below in “factors influencing future performance” and in “item 1a risk factors”

in connection with the 2018 issuances of mandatory convertible preferred stock we declared 125 million and paid 89 million of preferred stock dividends in 2018 in addition on february 21 2019 our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of 150 per share on our series a preferred stock and 16875 per share on our series b preferred stock both payable on april 15 2019 we discuss dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sdge 

in 2018 2017 and 2016 sdge paid dividends to enova and enova paid corresponding dividends to sempra energy of 250 million  450 million and 175 million  respectively sdge’s dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for sdge to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program 

enova a wholly owned subsidiary of sempra energy owns all of sdge’s outstanding common stock accordingly dividends paid by sdge to enova and dividends paid by enova to sempra energy are both eliminated in sempra energy’s consolidated financial statements 

socalgas 

socalgas declared and paid common stock dividends to pe and pe paid corresponding dividends to sempra energy of 50 million in 2018 as a result of socalgas’ capital investment program of over 1 billion per year socalgas did not declare or pay common stock dividends in 2017 or 2016 socalgas’ common stock dividends in the next few years will be impacted by its ability to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program 

pe a wholly owned subsidiary of sempra energy owns all of socalgas’ outstanding common stock accordingly dividends paid by socalgas to pe and dividends paid by pe to sempra energy are both eliminated in sempra energy’s consolidated financial statements 

dividend restrictions 

the board of directors for each of sempra energy sdge and socalgas has the discretion to determine the payment and amount of future dividends by each such entity the cpuc’s regulation of sdge’s and socalgas’ capital structures limits the amounts that are available for loans and dividends to sempra energy at december 31 2018  based on these regulations sempra energy could have received loans and dividends of approximately 552 million from sdge and 618 million from socalgas 

we provide additional information about dividend restrictions in “restricted net assets” in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

book value per common share 

sempra energy’s book value per common share on the last day of each year was 

 the increase in 2018 was primarily the result of increases in equity from issuances of common stock including sharebased compensation partially offset by dividends exceeding comprehensive income in 2017  the decrease was attributable to dividends in excess of comprehensive income partially offset by an increase in equity from sharebased compensation 

capitalization 

our debt to capitalization ratio calculated as total debt as a percentage of total debt and equity was as follows 



 

significant changes in 2018 that affected capitalization included the following

factors influencing future performance 

sempra energy 

capital rotation 

we regularly review our portfolio of assets with a view toward allocating capital to those businesses that we believe can further improve shareholder value in june 2018 we announced following a comprehensive strategic review of our businesses and asset portfolio by our board of directors and management over the past year our intention to sell several energy infrastructure assets including our entire portfolio of us wind and us solar assets as well as certain nonutility natural gas storage assets in the southeast us in december 2018 sempra renewables completed the sale of all its operating solar assets one wind generation facility and its solar and battery storage development projects to a subsidiary of con ed for 16 billion in february 2019 sempra renewables entered into an agreement to sell its remaining us wind assets to american electric power for 551 million subject to customary closing adjustments we expect to complete the sale in the second quarter of 2019 also in february 2019 sempra lng  midstream completed the sale of its nonutility natural gas storage assets in the southeast us comprised of mississippi hub and bay gas to an affiliate of arclight capital partners for 328 million subject to working capital adjustments and sempra lng  midstream’s purchase for 20 million of the 91percent minority interest in bay gas immediately prior to and included as part of the sale we continue to actively pursue the sale of our remaining us wind assets we discuss these sales further in notes 5 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and below in “sempra renewables” and “sempra lng  midstream” on january 25 2019 our board of directors approved a plan to sell our south american businesses we expect to complete the sales process by the end of 2019 

shareholder activism 

from time to time activist shareholders may take certain actions to advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors or management on june 11 2018 elliott associates lp and elliott international lp collectively elliott and bluescape resources company llc bluescape disclosed they were collectively holders of an approximately 49percent economic interest in our outstanding common stock as of such date and delivered a letter and accompanying presentation to our board of directors seeking collaboration with them and management to nominate six new directors identified by elliott and bluescape and establish a committee of the board of directors to conduct portfolio and operational reviews of our business in september 2018 we announced that we reached an agreement with elliott bluescape and cove key management lp that among other things added two new board members that were mutually agreed between the parties and repurposed the board’s lng construction and technology committee into the lng and business development committee which will conduct a comprehensive business review of sempra energy the new committee is comprised of the three previously existing committee members and the two new board members we are committed to continued constructive communications with all our shareholders and are available to discuss and evaluate ideas from our shareholders on how to maximize longterm value 

sdge 

sdge’s operations have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity its performance will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process environmental regulations economic conditions actions by the california legislature and the changing energy marketplace 

capital project updates 

we summarize below information regarding certain major capital projects at sdge that are pending regulatory resolution 



the following capital projects that we discussed in our 2017 annual report on form 10k andor our 2018 quarterly reports on form 10q have been approved by the cpuc 

 electric rate reform – california assembly bill 327 

ab 327 became law on january 1 2014 and restores the authority to establish electric residential rates for electric utility companies in california to the cpuc and removes the rate caps established in ab 1x adopted in early 2001 during california’s energy crisis and in sb 695 adopted in 2009 additionally the bill provides the cpuc the authority to adopt a monthly fixed charge for all residential customers in july 2015 the cpuc adopted a decision that established comprehensive reform and a framework for rates that we believe are more transparent fair and sustainable the decision directed changes beginning in 2015 and provides a path for continued reforms through 2020 the changes also included fewer rate tiers and a gradual reduction in the difference between the tiered rates similar to the tier differential that existed prior to the 20002001 energy crisis and a transition to tou rates the decision allows the utilities to seek a fixed charge for residential customers but sets certain conditions for its implementation which would be no sooner than 2020 depending on cpuc approval in december 2018 the cpuc approved sdge’s request to implement residential default tou rates beginning in 2019 overall these reforms should result in a rate structure that better aligns rates with the actual cost to serve customers 

in july 2014 the cpuc initiated a rulemaking proceeding to develop a successor tariff to the state’s existing nem program pursuant to the provisions of ab 327 the nem program was originally established in 1995 and is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of onsite renewable generation under nem qualifying customergenerators receive a full retailrate for the energy they generate that is fed back to the utility’s power grid this occurs during times when the customer’s generation exceeds its own energy usage in addition if a nem customer generates any electricity over the annual measurement period that exceeds its annual consumption the customer receives compensation at a rate equal to a wholesale energy price 

sdge implemented a successor nem tariff in july 2016 after reaching the 617mw cap established for the original nem program the successor nem tariff requires nem customers to pay some costs that would otherwise be borne by nonnem customers and moves new nem customers to tou rates these changes to the nem program begin a process of reducing the 

cost burden on nonnem customers but sdge believes that further reforms are necessary in a january 2016 decision the cpuc committed to revisit the nem successor tariff and the adequacy of its nem reforms and we expect that review will begin in the second half of 2019 as of december 31 2018 the total nem capacity in sdge’s service territory totaled 1023 mw 

further nem reform is necessary to help ensure that sdge is authorized to recover from nem customers the costs incurred in providing grid and energy services as well as mandated legislative and regulatory public policy programs sdge believes this approach would be preferable to recovering these costs from customers not participating in nem if nem selfgenerating installations continue to increase at their present pace the rate structure adopted by the cpuc could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects for additional discussion see “item 1a risk factors” 

potential impacts of community choice aggregation and direct access 

sdge provides electric services including the commodity of electricity to the majority of its customers “bundled customers” sdge enters into longterm contracts to procure electricity on behalf of these bundled customers sdge’s earnings are “decoupled” from electric sales volumes one aspect of decoupling is that commodity costs for electricity are directly passed through to bundled customers see discussion in “revenues from sources other than contracts with customers – utilities regulatory revenues” in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sdge’s bundled customers have the option to purchase the commodity of electricity from alternate suppliers under defined programs including cca and da in such cases california law sb 350 prohibits remaining bundled customers from experiencing any cost increase as a result of departing customers’ choice to receive electric commodity from an alternate supplier under the existing cost allocation mechanism approved by the cpuc customers opting to have a cca procure their electricity must absorb a portion of abovemarket cost of electricity procurement commitments already made by sdge on their behalf in october 2018 the cpuc issued a final decision that revises the current pcia framework by adopting several refinements to better ensure ratepayer indifference as required by law and directs sdge to implement updated pcia rates effective january 1 2019 using the adopted methodology the final decision revises the benchmarks used to calculate the pcia and directs the future implementation of an annual trueup mechanism to ensure that ratepayer indifference is maintained the decision also removes existing restrictions on recovering certain costs through the pcia including the ability to recover the abovemarket costs of resources that have been in the utility’s portfolio for more than 10 years and certain legacy utilityowned generation resources we believe these pcia changes should help ensure that cost allocations result in ratepayer indifference and comply with the law however further refinements to the pcia may be required to help ensure that the remaining bundled customers do not experience any cost increase as a result of customers departing to cca or da service 

renewable energy procurement 

sdge is subject to the rps program administered by both the cpuc and the cec in september 2018 sb 100 was signed into law and requires each california utility to procure 50 percent of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2026 and 60 percent by 2030 sb 100 also creates the policy of meeting all the state of california’s retail electricity supply with a mix of rpseligible and zerocarbon resources by 2045 for a total of 100 percent clean energy the law also includes stipulations that this policy not increase carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid and not allow resource shuffling and requires that the cpuc cec carb and other state agencies incorporate this policy into all relevant planning 

the rps program currently contains flexible compliance mechanisms that can be used to comply with or meet the rps program mandates sdge believes it will be able to comply with the rps program requirements as revised based on its contracting activity and if necessary application of the flexible compliance mechanisms sdge’s failure to comply with the rps program requirements could subject it to cpucimposed penalties which could materially adversely affect its business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

socalgas 

socalgas’ operations have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity its performance will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process environmental regulations economic conditions actions by the california legislature and the changing energy marketplace socalgas’ performance will also depend on the resolution of the legal regulatory and other matters concerning the leak at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility which we discuss below in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 1a risk factors” 

the following capital project that we discussed in our 2018 quarterly reports on form 10q has been approved by the cpuc 



aliso canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak 

in october 2015 socalgas discovered a leak at one of its injectionandwithdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility located in los angeles county socalgas worked closely with several of the world’s leading experts to stop the leak in february 2016 doggr confirmed that the well was permanently sealed 

see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussions of the following matters related to the leak 

 cost estimates accounting impacts and insurance 

at december 31 2018  socalgas estimates its costs related to the leak are 1055 million the cost estimate which includes 1027 million of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance approximately 54 percent of the cost estimate is for the temporary relocation program including cleaning costs and certain labor costs the remaining portion of the cost estimate includes costs incurred to defend litigation for the root cause analysis being conducted by an independent third party for efforts to control the well to mitigate the actual natural gas released the cost of replacing the lost gas and other costs as well as the estimated costs to settle certain actions 

as of december 31 2018  we recorded the expected recovery of the cost estimate related to the leak of 461 million as insurance receivable for aliso canyon costs on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s consolidated balance sheets this amount is net of insurance retentions and 566 million of insurance proceeds we received through december 31 2018 related to portions of the cost estimate described above including temporary relocation and associated processing costs controlofwell expenses legal costs and lost gas if we were to conclude that this receivable or a portion of it is no longer probable of recovery from insurers some or all of this receivable would be charged against earnings which could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

as described in “civil and criminal litigation” in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the actions seek compensatory statutory and punitive damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs which except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions are not included in the cost estimate as it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the amount of damages restitution or civil administrative or criminal fines penalties or other costs that may be imposed the recorded amounts above also do not include the costs to clean additional homes pursuant to the directives by the dph future legal costs necessary to defend litigation and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate furthermore the cost estimate does not include certain other costs incurred by sempra energy associated with defending against shareholder derivative lawsuits 

excluding directors’ and officers’ liability insurance we have at least four kinds of insurance policies that together we estimate provide between 12 billion to 14 billion in insurance coverage depending on the nature of the claims we cannot predict all of the potential categories of costs or the total amount of costs that we may incur as a result of the leak subject to various policy limits exclusions and conditions based on what we know as of the filing date of this report we believe that our insurance policies collectively should cover the following categories of costs costs incurred for temporary relocation and associated processing costs including cleaning costs and certain labor costs costs to address the leak and stop or reduce emissions the root cause analysis being conducted to investigate the cause of the leak the value of lost gas costs incurred to mitigate the actual natural gas released costs associated with litigation and claims by nearby residents and businesses any costs to clean additional homes pursuant to directives by the dph and in some circumstances depending on their nature and manner of assessment fines and penalties there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for these costs and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining coverage or these costs exceed the amount of our coverage such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

as noted above at december 31 2018  socalgas’ estimate of costs related to the leak of 1055 million include 1027 million of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance this estimate may rise significantly as more information becomes available costs not included in the 1055 million cost estimate could be material if any costs are not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits if there are significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible such amounts could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

natural gas storage operations and reliability 

natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods including peak electric generation needs in the summer and heating needs in the winter the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility with a storage capacity of 86 bcf which represents 63 percent of socalgas’ natural gas storage inventory capacity is the largest socalgas storage facility and an important element of socalgas’ delivery system socalgas suspended injection of natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility beginning in october 2015 and in july 2017 resumed limited injections the cpuc has issued a series of directives to socalgas establishing the range of working gas to be maintained in the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility to help ensure safety and reliability for the region and just and reasonable rates in california the most recent of which issued july 2 2018 directed socalgas to maintain up to 34 bcf of working gas limited withdrawals of natural gas from the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were made in 2018 to augment natural gas supplies during critical demand periods 

if the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value it could result in an impairment of the facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs andor additional capital expenditures and natural gas reliability and electric generation in the region could be jeopardized at december 31 2018 the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of 724 million  any significant impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations for the period in which it is recorded higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas may not be recoverable in customer rates and could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

california utilities – joint matters 

capital project updates 

we summarize below information regarding certain major joint capital projects of the california utilities that are pending regulatory resolution 



the leak abatement compliance program that we discussed in our 2018 quarterly reports on form 10q has been approved by the cpuc the need for the pipeline safety  reliability project discussed in our 2017 annual report on form 10k and in our 2018 quarterly reports on form 10q is met by the line 1600 test or replacement project described above 

natural gas pipeline operations safety assessments 

in 2011 the california utilities filed plans with the cpuc to implement the cpuc’s directives to test or replace natural gas transmission pipelines that do not have sufficient documentation of a pressure test and to address retrofitting pipelines to allow for inline inspection tools and where appropriate automated or remote controlled shutoff valves referred to as psep in 2014 the cpuc issued a final decision approving the utilities’ analytical approach to implementing psep as embodied in an approved decision tree but did not preapprove recovery of the costs of implementing psep because initial cost estimates were too preliminary to form the basis for ratemaking instead the cpuc established a process to review the reasonableness of incurred psep costs afterthefact to determine the amounts that may be recovered from ratepayers as portions of psep have been completed actual costs have generally been higher than the preliminary estimates partially offset by changes in scope that have reduced costs implementation costs incurred through 2018 are summarized in the table below over time as we have completed an increasing number of projects socalgas and sdge achieve greater cost estimate accuracy as well as efficiencies in executing the project work cost estimates for work performed in 2017 2018 and forward reflect the development of more detailed estimates actual cost experience as portions of the work are completed and additional refinement in scope in addition implementation of new regulatory requirements or clarification of existing regulatory requirements in the future could materially impact the cost forecasts 

in 2016 the cpuc issued a final decision authorizing socalgas and sdge to recover in rates 50 percent of the balances recorded in psep regulatory accounts as of january 1 each year subject to refund pending reasonableness review the decision also incorporated a forwardlooking schedule to file reasonableness review applications in 2016 and 2018 file a forecast application for preapproval of project costs incurred in 2017 and 2018 and to include psep costs not the subject of prior applications in future grcs we expect this transition from an afterthefact reasonableness review framework to preapproval of psep implementation costs based on cost forecasts to improve the certainty of recovery for psep implementation costs 

in september 2016 socalgas and sdge filed a joint application with the cpuc for review of psep project costs completed through june 2015 the total costs submitted for review are approximately 195 million 180 million for socalgas and 15 million for sdge including certain costs for which we were not seeking recovery the cpuc approved a final decision in february 2019 for cost recovery of approximately 187 million 172 million for socalgas and 15 million for sdge through the psep program 

in march 2017 socalgas and sdge filed an application with the cpuc requesting preapproval of the forecasted revenue requirement associated with twelve psep projects effective in rates on january 1 2019 the california utilities expect to incur total costs for the twelve projects of approximately 255 million 198 million in capital expenditures and 57 million in om we expect a cpuc decision in 2019 

in november 2018 socalgas and sdge filed a joint application with the cpuc for review of completed psep projects totaling 941 million 811 million at socalgas and 130 million at sdge including certain costs for which we are not seeking recovery we expect a cpuc decision in 2020 

as shown in the table below socalgas and sdge have made significant pipeline safety investments under the psep program and socalgas expects to continue making significant investments as approved through various regulatory proceedings sdge’s psep program was substantially completed in 2017 with the exception of line 1600 which we discuss in the table above both utilities have filed joint applications or plan to file future applications with the cpuc for review of the psep project costs as follows 



 

if either socalgas or sdge were unable to recover a significant amount of these safety investments from ratepayers it could have a material adverse effect on the cash flows results of operations and financial condition of socalgas sdge and sempra energy 

cpuc general rate case 

we describe the cpuc grc proceeding in “item 1 business – ratemaking mechanisms – california utilities – general rate case proceedings” on october 6 2017 sdge and socalgas filed their 2019 grc applications requesting cpuc approval of test year revenue requirements for 2019 and attrition year adjustments for 2020 through 2022 we discuss the 2019 grc in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the results of the rate case may materially and adversely differ from what is contained in the grc applications 

incentive mechanisms 

we describe cpuc incentive mechanisms in “item 1 business – ratemaking mechanisms – california utilities – incentive mechanisms” incentive awards are included in revenues when we receive final cpuc approval of the award the timing of which may not be consistent from year to year we would record penalties for results below the specified benchmarks against revenues when we believe it is probable that the cpuc would assess a penalty 

energy efficiency 

the cpuc has established incentive mechanisms that are based on the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs 





in march 2017 the cpuc approved the settlement agreements reached with the cal pa and turn regarding the incentive awards for program years 2006 through 2008 wherein the parties agreed that sdge and socalgas would offset up to a total of approximately 4 million each against future incentive awards over a threeyear period beginning in 2017 if the total incentive awards ultimately authorized for 2017 through 2019 are less than approximately 4 million for either utility the applicable utility is released from paying any remaining unapplied amount 

natural gas procurement 

the california utilities procure natural gas on behalf of their core natural gas customers the cpuc has established incentive mechanisms to allow the california utilities the opportunity to share in the savings andor costs from buying natural gas for their core customers at prices below or above monthly marketbased benchmarks socalgas procures natural gas for sdge’s core natural gas customers’ requirements socalgas’ gcim is applied on the combined portfolio basis 



in february 2019 the cpuc issued a draft decision approving socalgas’ gcim award of 11 million for natural gas procured for its core customers during the 12month period ended march 31 2018 

operational incentives 

the cpuc may establish operational incentives and associated performance benchmarks as part of a grc or cost of service proceeding in the 2016 grc fd the cpuc did not establish any operational incentives for socalgas but established an electric reliability incentive for sdge outcomes could vary from a maximum annual penalty of 8 million to a maximum annual award of 8 million 

senate bill 901 

on september 21 2018 the governor of california signed into law sb 901 which includes a number of measures primarily intended to address certain wildfire risks relevant to consumers and utilities and guidelines for the cpuc to determine whether utilities acted reasonably in order to recover costs related to wildfires among other things sb 901 also contains provisions for utility issuance of recovery bonds with respect to certain wildfire costs subject to cpuc approval wildfire mitigation plans and creation of a commission to explore establishment of a fund and options for cost socialization with respect to catastrophic wildfires associated with utility infrastructure the provisions of sb 901 are applicable to 2017 wildfire costs incurred by utilities if any and wildfire events occurring on or after january 1 2019 they do not apply to the wildfires in sdge’s service territory in 2007 

the cpuc initiated an oir in october 2018 to implement the provisions of sb 901 related to electric utility wildfire mitigation plans the oir will provide guidance on the form and content of the initial wildfire mitigation plans provide a venue for review of the initial plans and develop and refine the content of and process for review and implementation of wildfire mitigation plans to be filed in future years the electric utilities filed their proposed wildfire mitigation plans in february 2019 and we expect the cpuc will make a decision on the final plans in mid2019 the scope of the oir is limited to only the wildfire mitigation plans required by sb 901 and does not include cost recovery pursuant to sb 901 the cpuc shall authorize each utility to establish a memorandum account to track the costs incurred to implement the plan the costs recorded to the memorandum account shall be incremental to the utility’s authorized recovery and reviewed as part of the utility’s next grc proceeding 

sb 901 did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation which imposes strict liability on a utility whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire meaning that the utility may be found liable regardless of fault in their 2018 ratings actions for sdge which we discuss in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – credit ratings” each of moody’s fitch ratings and sp indicated that the sdge rating downgrades reflected the failure of sb 901 to address the longerterm risks associated with inverse condemnation without further changes to the law or other reform we believe that sdge is exposed to the potential of material liabilities if a major wildfire were to occur in its service territory and it was determined that its equipment was a cause of the fire 

separately sb 901 together with draft guidance from the cpuc also provides that electric and gas corporations such as 

sdge and socalgas shall no longer recover compensation including salary bonus benefits or other consideration paid of certain senior officers from ratepayers rather such compensation shall be a shareholder expense in december 2018 the cpuc published a resolution ordering memorandum accounts to be established to track such compensation costs 

sempra texas utility 

acquisition of oncor holdings 

on march 9 2018 we completed the acquisition of an indirect 100percent interest in oncor holdings which owns an 8025percent interest in oncor and other efh assets and liabilities unrelated to oncor as we discuss in “item 1 business” due to ringfencing measures existing governance mechanisms and commitments in effect following the merger we are prevented from having the power to direct the significant activities of oncor holdings and oncor as a result we account for our 100percent ownership interest in oncor holdings as an equity method investment which is included in our newly formed reportable segment sempra texas utility certain other assets and liabilities unrelated to oncor acquired in connection with the merger were subsumed within our parent organization we discuss this merger and the related financing in notes 5  7  13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and above in “capital resources and liquidity” 

the success of the merger will depend in part on the ability of oncor to successfully execute its business strategy including several objectives that are capital intensive and to respond to challenges in the electric utility industry if oncor is not able to achieve these objectives is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis or otherwise fails to perform in accordance with our expectations the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all and the merger may materially adversely affect the results of operations financial condition and prospects of sempra energy 

pending acquisitions 

on october 18 2018 oncor entered into the infrareit merger agreement whereby oncor has agreed to acquire a 100 percent interest in infrareit and infrareit partners for approximately 1275 million plus approximately 40 million for a management agreement termination fee as well as other customary transaction costs incurred by infrareit that would be borne by oncor as part of the acquisition in addition the transaction includes infrareit’s outstanding debt which as of september 30 2018 was approximately 945 million also on october 18 2018 oncor entered into the asset exchange agreement whereby sdts has agreed to accept and assume certain electricity transmission and distributionrelated assets and liabilities of su in exchange for certain sdts assets immediately prior to completing the exchange sdts would become a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of infrareit partners 

on october 18 2018 sempra energy entered into the securities purchase agreement whereby sempra texas utilities holdings i llc has agreed to acquire 50 percent of the economic interest in sharyland holdings lp for approximately 98 million subject to customary closing adjustments in connection with and prior to the consummation of the securities purchase agreement sharyland holdings lp would own 100 percent of the membership interests in su and su would convert into a limited liability company expected to be named sharyland utilities llc upon consummation of the securities purchase agreement sempra texas utilities holdings i llc would indirectly own and account for its 50 percent interest in sharyland utilities llc as an equity method investment 

consummation of these transactions is subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions including the substantially concurrent consummation of these transactions these transactions also require approval by the puct and the ferc as well as the satisfaction of other regulatory requirements approval of the committee on foreign investment in the united states and other customary closing conditions the acquisition of infrareit was approved by infrareit stockholders on february 7 2019 we expect that the transactions will close in mid2019 there can be no assurance that oncor and sempra energy will derive the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions 

we discuss these transactions further in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

oncor intends to fund its acquisition of interests in infrareit from capital contributions from sempra energy and certain indirect equity holders of tti proportionate to sempra energy’s and tti’s respective ownership interests in oncor we plan to fund our approximately 1025 million share of the contribution to oncor excluding sempra energy’s share of approximately 40 million for a management agreement termination fee as well as other customary transaction costs incurred by infrareit that would be borne by oncor as part of the acquisition and purchase the 50percent interest in sharyland holdings lp by utilizing a portion of the 16 billion of proceeds received from the december 2018 sale of certain sempra renewables assets to a subsidiary of con ed that we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

sempra south american utilities 

on january 25 2019 our board of directors approved a plan to sell our south american businesses based on our strategic shift to be geographically focused on north america we expect to complete the sales process by the end of 2019 

our utilities in south america have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity and their future performance will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process environmental regulations foreign currency rate fluctuations and economic conditions they are also expected to provide earnings from construction projects when completed and from other investments but will require substantial funding for these investments

luz del sur  potential impact from tolling customers 

luz del sur is an electric distribution utility that provides electric services including the supply of electricity to regulated and nonregulated customers nonregulated customers consist of free and tolling customers luz del sur supplies electricity to its customers from power purchased from generators under longterm takeorpay ppas a free customer has the option of purchasing electricity directly from luz del sur while paying fees to luz del sur for generation transmission primary and secondary and distribution services or choosing to become a tolling customer a tolling customer purchases electricity from alternative suppliers and pays only a tolling fee to luz del sur for secondary transmission and distribution to the extent customers have the right to and choose to become tolling customers luz del sur may be exposed to stranded costs related to capacity charges under its longterm takeorpay ppas we discuss luz del sur’s customers and demand in “item 1 business” 

sempra mexico 

capital project updates 

we summarize major projects in process at sempra mexico below 







sempra mexico continues to monitor cfe project opportunities and carefully analyze cfe bids in order to participate in those that fit its overall growth strategy there can be no assurance that ienova will be successful in bidding for new cfe projects 

the ability to successfully complete major construction projects is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties see “item 1a risk factors” 

energía costa azul lng terminal 

sempra lng  midstream and ienova are developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project at ienova’s existing regasification terminal at eca the proposed liquefaction facility project which we expect will be developed in two phases is being developed to provide buyers with direct access to west coast lng supplies eca currently has profitable longterm regasification contracts for 100 percent of the regasification facility’s capacity through 2028 making the decision to pursue a new liquefaction facility dependent in part on whether the investment in a new liquefaction facility would over the long term be more beneficial financially than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts 

in november 2018 sempra energy and total sa entered into an mou that provides a framework for cooperation for the development of the potential eca liquefactionexport project and the potential cameron lng expansion project that we describe below in “sempra lng  midstream – proposed additional cameron liquefaction expansion” the mou contemplates total sa potentially contracting for up to approximately 9 mtpa of lng offtake across these two development projects and provides total sa the option to acquire an equity interest in the proposed eca lng liquefaction facility project though the ultimate participation by total sa remains subject to finalization of definitive agreements among other factors the mou does not commit any party to sign a definitive agreement or otherwise participate in the project 

in june 2018 we selected a technipfmc plc and kiewit corporation partnership as the epc contractor for the first phase of the proposed eca lng liquefaction facility project eca lng phase 1 the technipfmckiewit partnership is to perform the engineering planning and related activities necessary to prepare negotiate and finalize a definitive epc contract for eca lng phase 1 the current arrangement with the technipfmckiewit partnership does not commit any party to enter into a definitive epc contract or otherwise participate in the project 

in november 2018 sempra lng  midstream and ienova signed heads of agreements with affiliates of total sa mitsui  co ltd and tokyo gas co ltd for eca lng phase 1 we expect eca lng phase 1 to be a single train liquefaction facility located within the existing lng receipt terminal site with a capacity of approximately 24 mtpa of lng for export to global markets each heads of agreement for eca lng phase 1 contemplates the parties negotiating definitive 20year lng sales and purchase agreements for the purchase of approximately 08 mtpa of lng from the eca lng facility but does not obligate the parties to ultimately execute any agreements or otherwise participate in the project 

the ultimate participation of total sa mitsui  co ltd and tokyo gas co ltd in the potential eca lng project as contemplated by the heads of agreements remains subject to finalization of definitive agreements among other factors the development of the eca lng phase 1 and phase 2 projects is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including obtaining binding customer commitments the receipt of a number of permits and regulatory approvals obtaining financing negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including a definitive epc contract equity acquisition and governance agreements lng sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements reaching a final investment decision and other factors associated with this potential investment for a discussion of these risks see “item 1a risk factors” 

sempra renewables 

sempra renewables’ performance is primarily a function of the wind and previously solar power generated by its assets power generation from these assets depends on solar and wind resource levels weather conditions and sempra renewables’ ability to maintain equipment performance 

as we discuss in notes 5 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in june 2018 our board of directors approved a plan to sell all our us wind assets and us solar assets including our wholly and jointly owned operating facilities and projects in development in our sempra renewables reportable segment in december 2018 sempra renewables completed the sale of all its operating solar assets its solar and battery storage development projects and one wind generation facility to a subsidiary of con ed for 16 billion in february 2019 sempra renewables entered into an agreement with american electric power to sell its remaining wind assets and investments for 551 million subject to working capital adjustments and customary closing conditions we expect to complete the sale in the second quarter of 2019 

because of our expectation of a shorter holding period as a result of this plan of sale we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying amounts of our wind and solar equity method investments and concluded there was an otherthantemporary impairment on certain of our wind equity method investments totaling 200 million  145 million after tax which we recorded in equity earnings in june 2018 

we may be unable to complete the sale of the remaining us renewable assets in which case we would not realize the anticipated benefits alternatively even if completed any such sale may not result in the anticipated benefits to our business results of operations and financial condition in a timely manner or at all further we could experience unexpected delays business disruptions resulting from supporting this initiative during and following completion of these activities decreased productivity adverse effects on employee morale and employee turnover as a result of such initiative any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated results or otherwise harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

sempra lng  midstream 

cameron lng jv threetrain liquefaction project 



construction on the current threetrain liquefaction project began in the second half of 2014 under an epc contract with a jv between cbi llc as assignee of cbi shaw constructors inc a wholly owned subsidiary of mcdermott international inc and chiyoda international corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of chiyoda corporation 

the total cost of the integrated cameron lng jv facility including the cost of the original facility that was contributed to the project during construction financing costs and required reserves was estimated to be approximately 10 billion at the time of our final investment decision 

sempra lng  midstream has agreements totaling 145 bcf per day of firm natural gas transportation service to the cameron lng jv facilities on the cameron interstate pipeline with affiliates of total sa mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd the terms of these agreements are concurrent with the liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements 

sempra energy and the project partners executed project financing documents for senior secured debt in an aggregate principal amount up to 74 billion for the purpose of financing the cost of development and construction of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project sempra energy has entered into guarantees under which it has severally guaranteed 502 percent of cameron lng jv’s obligations under the project financing and financingrelated agreements for a maximum amount of up to 39 billion  the project financing and completion guarantees became effective on october 1 2014 and the guarantees will terminate upon financial completion of the project which will occur upon satisfaction of certain conditions including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests we expect the project to achieve financial completion and the completion guarantees to be terminated approximately nine months after all three trains achieve commercial operation 

largescale construction projects like the design development and construction of the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility involve numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the potential for unforeseen engineering challenges substantial construction delays and increased costs cameron lng jv has a turnkey epc contract and if the contractor becomes unwilling or unable to perform according to the terms and timetable of the epc contract the project could face substantial construction delays and potentially significantly increased costs if the contractor’s delays or failures are serious enough to cause the contractor to default under the epc contract such default could result in cameron lng jv’s engagement of a substitute contractor which would cause further delays 

based on a number of factors we believe it is reasonable to expect that cameron lng jv will start generating earnings in the middle of 2019 these factors include among others the terms of the settlement agreement entered into in december 2017 with the epc contractor to settle certain contractor’s claims the epc contractor’s progress to date the current commissioning 

activities the remaining work to be performed the project schedules received from the epc contractor cameron lng jv’s own review of the project schedules the assumptions underlying such schedules and the inherent risks in constructing and testing facilities such as the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility for a discussion of the cameron lng jv and of these risks and other risks relating to the development of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project that could adversely affect our future performance see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “item 1a risk factors” 

project delays that occurred prior to december 2017 and the terms of the related settlement agreement between cameron lng jv and the epc contractor increased the total estimated cost of the integrated cameron lng facility above the approximately 10 billion estimated cost however the estimated increase is expected to be within our contingency associated with the project budget adopted at the time of our final investment decision and is not expected to be material to sempra energy  

proposed additional cameron liquefaction expansion 

cameron lng jv has received the major permits and fta and nonfta approvals necessary to expand the current configuration of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project from the current three liquefaction trains under construction the proposed expansion project includes up to two additional liquefaction trains capable of increasing lng production capacity by approximately 9 mtpa to 10 mtpa and up to two additional full containment lng storage tanks one of which was permitted with the original threetrain project 

under the cameron lng jv financing agreements expansion of the cameron lng jv facilities beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions including among others timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from lenders under the cameron lng jv equity agreements the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all the partners including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner discussions among the partners have been taking place regarding how an expansion may be structured in july 2018 total sa acquired engie sa’s interest in the cameron lng jv in november 2018 sempra energy and total sa entered into an mou that provides a framework for cooperation for the development of the potential cameron lng expansion project and the potential eca liquefactionexport project that we describe above in “sempra mexico – energía costa azul lng terminal” the mou contemplates total sa potentially contracting for up to approximately 9 mtpa of lng offtake across these two development projects though the ultimate participation of total sa remains subject to finalization of definitive agreements among other factors and total sa has no commitment to participate in the project we expect that discussions on the potential expansion will continue among all the cameron lng jv members there can be no assurance that a mutually agreeable expansion structure will be agreed upon unanimously by the cameron lng jv members which if not accomplished in a timely manner could materially and adversely impact the development of the expansion project in light of this we are unable to predict when we andor cameron lng jv might be able to move forward on this expansion project 

the expansion of the cameron lng jv facilities beyond the first three trains is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including amending the cameron lng jv agreement among the partners obtaining binding customer commitments completing the required commercial agreements securing and maintaining all necessary permits approvals and consents obtaining financing reaching a final investment decision among the cameron lng jv partners and other factors associated with the potential investment see “item 1a risk factors” 

other lng liquefaction development 

design regulatory and commercial activities are ongoing for potential lng liquefaction developments at our port arthur texas site and at sempra mexico’s eca facility for these development projects we have met with potential customers and determined there is an interest in longterm contracts for lng supplies beginning in the 2022 to 2025 time frame 

port arthur 

sempra lng  midstream is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project on a greenfield site that it owns in the vicinity of port arthur texas located along the sabineneches waterway 

in november 2016 sempra lng  midstream submitted an application to the ferc for approval of the siting construction and operation of the port arthur liquefaction facility along with certain natural gas pipelines that could be used to supply feed gas to the liquefaction facility assuming the project is completed on january 31 2019 the ferc issued the final environmental impact statement for the project this is the final step in the environmental review process before the ferc can proceed to issue an order approving the project 

in june 2015 sempra lng  midstream filed permit applications with the doe for authorization to export the lng produced from the proposed port arthur project to all current and future nonfta countries in august 2015 sempra lng  midstream received authorization from the doe to export the lng produced from the proposed project to all current and future fta 

countries we expect to receive authorization to export to nonfta countries assuming we receive authorization to construct the port arthur facility from the ferc 

in june 2018 we selected bechtel as the epc contractor for the proposed port arthur liquefaction project bechtel is to perform the engineering execution planning and related activities necessary to prepare negotiate and finalize a definitive epc contract for the project the current arrangement with bechtel does not commit any party to enter into a definitive epc contract or otherwise participate in the project 

in december 2018 polish oil  gas company pgnig and port arthur lng entered into a definitive 20year agreement for the sale and purchase of 2 mtpa of lng per year under the agreement lng purchases by pgnig from port arthur lng will be made on a freeonboard basis with pgnig responsible for shipping the lng from the port arthur terminal to the final destination port arthur lng will manage the gas pipeline transportation liquefaction processing and cargo loading the agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent including port arthur lng making a positive final investment decision 

development of the port arthur lng liquefaction project is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including obtaining additional customer commitments completing the required commercial agreements such as equity acquisition and governance agreements lng sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements completing construction contracts securing all necessary permits and approvals obtaining financing and incentives reaching a final investment decision and other factors associated with the potential investment see “item 1a risk factors”

we further discuss sempra lng  midstream’s participation in potential lng liquefaction development at sempra mexico’s eca facility above in “sempra mexico – energía costa azul lng terminal” 

natural gas storage assets 

as we discuss in notes 5 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in june 2018 our board of directors approved a plan to sell mississippi hub and our 909percent ownership interest in bay gas on february 7 2019 sempra lng  midstream completed the sale of its nonutility natural gas storage assets in the southeast us comprised of mississippi hub and bay gas to an affiliate of arclight capital partners sempra lng  midstream received cash proceeds of 328 million subject to working capital adjustments and sempra lng  midstream’s purchase for 20 million of the 91percent minority interest in bay gas immediately prior to and included as part of the sale as a result of the impairment charges recorded in 2018 we do not expect to recognize a gain or loss on the sale which is subject to working capital adjustments in 2019 because the carrying value of the assets equaled fair value less costs to sell at closing arclight capital partners owns 100 percent of mississippi hub and bay gas 

other sempra energy matters 

we may be impacted by rapidly changing economic conditions these conditions may also affect our counterparties moreover the dollar may fluctuate significantly compared to some foreign currencies especially in mexico and south america where we have significant operations we discuss these matters in “impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations” above and in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

north american natural gas prices when in decline negatively affect profitability at sempra lng  midstream also a reduction in projected global demand for lng could result in increased competition among those working on projects in an environment of declining lng demand such as the sempra energysponsored lng export initiatives for a discussion of these risks and other risks involving changing commodity prices see “item 1a risk factors” 

litigation 

we describe legal proceedings that could adversely affect our future performance in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

management views certain accounting policies as critical because their application is the most relevant judgmental andor material to our financial position and results of operations andor because they require the use of material judgments and estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss choices among alternative accounting policies that are material to our financial statements and information concerning significant estimates with the audit committee of the sempra energy board of directors 

contingencies 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

we accrue losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes for loss contingencies we accrue the loss if an event has occurred on or before the balance sheet date and   

 we do not accrue contingencies that might result in gains we continuously assess contingencies for litigation claims environmental remediation and other events 

details of our issues in this area are discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

regulatory accounting 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

as regulated entities the california utilities’ rates as set and monitored by regulators are designed to recover the cost of providing service and provide the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investments the california utilities record regulatory assets which are generally costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that through the ratemaking process the utility will recover that asset from customers in future rates similarly regulatory liabilities are recorded for amounts recovered in rates in advance or in excess of costs incurred the california utilities assess probabilities of future rate recovery associated with regulatory account balances at the end of each reporting period and whenever new andor unusual events occur such as 

 to the extent that circumstances associated with regulatory balances change the regulatory balances are evaluated and adjusted if appropriate 

adverse legislative or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of our regulatory assets and liabilities and could materially adversely impact our financial statements details of the california utilities’ regulatory assets and liabilities and additional factors that management considers when assessing probabilities associated with regulatory balances are discussed in notes 1  4  15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management judgments and estimates amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as well as current and noncurrent accruals involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities when we evaluate the anticipated resolution of income tax issues we consider 

 the likelihood of deferred income tax recovery is based on analyses of the deferred income tax assets and our expectation of future taxable income based on our strategic planning 

actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts because of   

 for an uncertain position to qualify for benefit recognition the position must have at least a more likely than not chance of being sustained based on the position’s technical merits upon challenge by the respective authorities the term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than 50 percent if we do not have a more likely than not position with respect to a tax position then we do not recognize any of the potential tax benefit associated with the position a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon the effective resolution of the tax position 

unrecognized tax benefits involve management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of the benefit being sustained the final resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in adjustments to recorded amounts and may affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we discuss details of our issues in this area and additional information related to accounting for income taxes including uncertainty in income taxes in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

derivatives and hedge accounting 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

we record derivative instruments for which we do not apply a scope exception at fair value on the balance sheet depending on the purpose for the contract and the applicability of hedge or regulatory accounting the changes in fair value of derivatives may be recorded in earnings on the balance sheet or in oci we also use the normal purchase or sale exception for certain derivative contracts whenever possible we use exchange quoted prices or other thirdparty pricing to estimate fair values if no such data is available we use internally developed models and other techniques the assumed collectability of derivative assets and receivables considers   

 the application of hedge accounting and normal purchase or sale accounting for certain derivatives is determined on a contractbycontract basis significant changes in assumptions in our cash flow hedges such as the amount andor timing of forecasted transactions could cause unrealized gains or losses marktomarket to be reclassified out of aoci to earnings which may materially impact our results of operations additionally changes in assumed physical delivery on contracts for which we elected normal purchase or sale accounting may result in “tainting” of the election which may 1 preclude us from making this election in future transactions and 2 impact sempra energy’s results of operations any resulting impact on the california utilities’ results of operations would not be significant because regulatory accounting principles generally apply to their contracts we provide details of our derivative instruments and our fair value approaches in notes 11 and 12  respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

sempra energy sdge socalgas 

to measure our pension and other postretirement obligations costs and liabilities we rely on several assumptions we consider current market conditions including interest rates in making these assumptions we review these assumptions annually and update when appropriate   

the critical assumptions used to develop the required estimates include the following key factors   

 the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to   

 these differences other than those related to the california utilities’ plans where rate recovery offsets the effects of the assumptions on earnings may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense we record for plans other than those at the california utilities the approximate annual effect on earnings of a 100 bps increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would be less than 2 million and the effect of a 100 bps increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would be less than 2 million we provide details of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

asset retirement obligations 

sempra energy sdge 

sdge’s legal aros related to the decommissioning of songs are estimated based on a sitespecific study performed no less than every three years the estimate of the obligations includes   

 changes in the estimated decommissioning costs or in the assumptions and judgments made by management underlying these estimates could cause revisions to the estimated total cost associated with retiring the assets sdge’s nuclear decommissioning expenses are subject to rate recovery and therefore ratemaking accounting treatment is applied to sdge’s nuclear decommissioning activities sdge recognizes a regulatory asset or liability to the extent that its songs aro exceeds or is less than the amount collected from customers and the amount earned in sdge’s ndt 

we provide additional detail in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment testing of longlived assets 

sempra energy 

whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable we consider if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets if so we estimate the fair value of these assets to determine the extent to which carrying value exceeds fair value for these estimates we may consider data from multiple valuation methods including data from market participants we exercise judgment to estimate the future cash flows and the useful lives of longlived assets and to determine our intent to use the assets our intent to use or dispose of assets is subject to reevaluation and can change over time 

if an impairment test is required the fair value of longlived assets can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions we discuss impairment of longlived assets in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment testing of goodwill 

sempra energy 

on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation we consider whether goodwill may be impaired for our annual goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test if we elect to perform the qualitative assessment we evaluate relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors changes in key personnel and the overall financial performance of the reporting unit if after assessing these qualitative factors we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the twostep goodwill impairment test when we perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we exercise judgment to develop estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to the carrying value our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant we consider observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments if available as well as an incomebased approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis a discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future revenues and expenses and may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the reporting unit critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include   

 when we choose to make a qualitative assessment as discussed above the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test is not required if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or when we choose to proceed directly to the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test the test requires us to first determine if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value and if so to measure the amount of goodwill impairment if any when determining if goodwill is impaired the fair value of the reporting unit and goodwill can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions as a result recognizing a goodwill impairment may or may not be required 

in 2018 we chose to proceed directly to the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units in mexico and south america to which goodwill was allocated were substantially above their carrying values as of october 1 2018 our goodwill impairment testing date we discuss goodwill in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

carrying value of equity method investments 

sempra energy 

we generally account for investments under the equity method when we have significant influence over but do not have control of the investee   

we consider whether the fair value of each equity investment as a whole not the underlying net assets has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary to help evaluate whether a decline in fair value below carrying value has occurred and if the decline is other than temporary we may develop fair value estimates for the investment our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant in the absence of observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments we consider an incomebased approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis or with less weighting the replacement cost of the underlying net assets a discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future distributions from the investment or may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the entity and adjusted for our ownership share total when calculating estimates of fair or realizable values we also consider whether we intend to hold or sell the investment for certain investments critical assumptions may include   

 in addition for our indirect investment in oncor critical assumptions may also include the effects of ratemaking such as the results of regulator decisions on rates and recovery of regulated investments and costs the risk assumptions applied by other market participants to value the investments could vary significantly or the appropriate approaches could be weighted differently these differences could impact whether or not the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value and if so whether that condition is other than temporary this could result in an impairment charge or a different amount of impairment charge and in cases where an impairment charge has been recorded additional loss or gain upon sale in the case of a sale transaction 

we provide additional details in notes 6 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards 

we discuss the relevant pronouncements that have recently become effective and have had or may have a significant effect on our financial statements in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of erosion of our cash flows earnings asset values and equity due to adverse changes in market prices and interest and foreign currency rates 

risk policies 

sempra energy has policies governing its market risk management and trading activities sempra energy and the california utilities maintain separate and independent risk management committees organizations and processes for the california utilities and for all noncpuc regulated affiliates to provide oversight of these activities the committees consist of senior officers who establish policy oversee energy risk management activities and monitor the results of trading and other activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies these activities include but are not limited to daily monitoring of market positions that create credit liquidity and market risk the respective oversight organizations and committees are independent from the energy procurement departments 

along with other tools we use var and liquidity metrics to measure our exposure to market risk associated with the commodity portfolios var is an estimate of the potential loss on a position or portfolio of positions over a specified holding period based on normal market conditions and within a given statistical confidence interval a liquidity metric is intended to monitor the amount of financial resources needed for meeting potential margin calls as forward market prices move var and liquidity risk metrics are calculated independently by the respective risk management oversight organizations 

the california utilities use power and natural gas derivatives to manage natural gas and electric price risk associated with servicing load requirements the use of power and natural gas derivatives is subject to certain limitations imposed by company policy and is in compliance with risk management and trading activity plans that have been filed with and approved by the cpuc we discuss revenue recognition in note 1 and the additional marketrisk information regarding derivative instruments in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have exposure to changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency rates and exposure to counterparty nonperformance the following discussion of these primary marketrisk exposures as of december 31 2018 includes a discussion of how these exposures are managed 

commodity price risk 

market risk related to physical commodities is created by volatility in the prices and basis of certain commodities our various subsidiaries are exposed in varying degrees to price risk primarily to prices in the natural gas and electricity markets our policy is to manage this risk within a framework that considers the unique markets and operating and regulatory environments of each subsidiary 

sempra mexico sempra renewables and sempra lng  midstream are generally exposed to commodity price risk indirectly through their lng natural gas pipeline and storage and power generating assets and their ppas these segments may utilize commodity transactions in the course of optimizing these assets these transactions are typically priced based on market indices but may also include fixed price purchases and sales of commodities any residual exposure is monitored as described above a hypothetical 10percent unfavorable change in commodity prices would not have resulted in a material change in the fair value of our commoditybased financial derivatives for these segments at december 31 2018 and 2017  the impact of a change in energy commodity prices on our commoditybased financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled also the impact of a change in energy commodity prices on our commoditybased financial derivative instruments does not typically include the generally offsetting impact of our underlying asset positions 

the california utilities’ marketrisk exposure is limited due to cpucauthorized rate recovery of the costs of commodity purchases interstate and intrastate transportation and storage activity however socalgas may at times be exposed to market risk as a result of incentive mechanisms that reward or penalize the utility for commodity costs below or above certain benchmarks for socalgas’ gcim if commodity prices were to rise too rapidly it is likely that volumes would decline this decline would increase the perunit fixed costs which could lead to further volume declines the california utilities manage their risk within the parameters of their market risk management framework as of and for the year ended december 31 2018  the total var of the california utilities’ natural gas and electric positions was not material and the procurement activities were in compliance with the procurement plans filed with and approved by the cpuc 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily as a result of our having issued short and longterm debt subject to regulatory constraints we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to moderate our exposure to interest rate changes and to lower our overall cost of borrowing 

the table below shows the nominal amount of debt 



 

interest rate risk sensitivity analysis measures interest rate risk by calculating the estimated changes in earnings that would result from a hypothetical change in market interest rates earnings are affected by changes in interest rates on shortterm debt and variable longterm debt if weightedaverage interest rates on shortterm debt outstanding at december 31 2018 increased or decreased by 10 percent the change in earnings over the next 12month period ended december 31 2019 would be approximately 6 million if interest rates increased or decreased by 10 percent on all variablerate longterm debt at december 31 2018  after considering the effects of interest rate swaps the change in earnings over the next 12month period ended december 31 2019 would be 5 million 

we provide further information about debt and interest rate swap transactions in notes 7 and 11 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we also are subject to the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the assets of our pension plans other postretirement benefit plans and sdge’s ndt however we expect the effects of these fluctuations as they relate to the california utilities to be recovered in future rates 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk of loss that would be incurred as a result of nonperformance by our counterparties on their contractual obligations we monitor credit risk through a creditapproval process and the assignment and monitoring of credit limits we establish these credit limits based on risk and return considerations under terms customarily available in the industry 

as with market risk we have policies governing the management of credit risk that are administered by the respective credit departments for each of the california utilities and on a combined basis for all noncpuc regulated affiliates and overseen by their separate risk management committees 

this oversight includes calculating current and potential credit risk on a daily basis and monitoring actual balances in comparison to approved limits we avoid concentration of counterparties whenever possible and we believe our credit policies significantly reduce overall credit risk these policies include an evaluation of 

 we believe that we have provided adequate reserves for counterparty nonperformance 

when its development projects become operational sempra energy relies significantly on the ability of suppliers to perform under longterm agreements and on our ability to enforce contract terms in the event of nonperformance also the factors that we consider in evaluating a development project include negotiating customer and supplier agreements and therefore we rely on these agreements for future performance we also may condition our decision to go forward on development projects on first obtaining these customer and supplier agreements 

as noted above in “interest rate risk” we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to moderate exposure to interest rate changes and to lower the overall cost of borrowing we would be exposed to interest rate fluctuations on the underlying debt should a counterparty to the swap fail to perform 

credit ratings 

the credit ratings of sempra energy sdge and socalgas remained at investment grade levels in 2018 at december 31 2018  

 on january 21 2019 sp downgraded sdge’s issuer credit rating to bbb from a while maintaining its negative outlook on january 22 2019 fitch ratings affirmed sdge’s longterm issuer default rating at a but revised the ratings outlook to negative from stable on january 24 2019 moody’s placed sdge under review for downgrade these ratings actions were primarily the result of recent wildfires in california in counties outside of the california utilities’ electric service territory and the possible inability to recover costs and expenses in cases where california ious like the california utilities are determined to have had equipment be the cause of a fire 

a downgrade of sempra energy’s or any of its subsidiaries’ credit ratings or rating outlooks may result in a requirement for collateral to be posted in the case of certain financing arrangements and may materially and adversely affect the market prices of their equity and debt securities the rates at which borrowings are made and commercial paper is issued and the various fees on 

their outstanding credit facilities this could make it more costly for sempra energy sdge socalgas and sempra energy’s other subsidiaries to issue debt securities to borrow under credit facilities and to raise certain other types of financing we provide additional information about our credit ratings at sempra energy sdge and socalgas in “item 1a risk factors” 

sempra energy has agreed that if the credit rating of oncor’s senior secured debt by any of the three major rating agencies falls below bbb or the equivalent oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions except for contractual tax payments unless otherwise allowed by the puct 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas have committed lines of credit to provide liquidity and to support commercial paper borrowings under these facilities bear interest at benchmark rates plus a margin that varies with market index rates and each borrower’s credit rating each facility also requires a commitment fee on available unused credit that may be impacted by each borrower’s credit rating under these committed lines 

 for sempra energy and sdge their credit ratings also may affect their respective credit limits related to derivative instruments as we discuss in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency and inflation rate risk 

we discuss our foreign currency and inflation exposure in “item 7 mda – impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations” 

the hypothetical effect for every 10 percent appreciation in the us dollar against the currencies of mexico chile and peru in which we have operations and investments are as follows 



 

monetary assets and liabilities at our mexican subsidiaries that are denominated in us dollars may fluctuate significantly throughout the year these monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes based on a net monetary liability position of 35 billion including those related to our investments in jvs at december 31 2018  the hypothetical effect of a 10 percent increase in the mexican inflation rate is approximately 67 million lower earnings as a result of higher income tax expense for our consolidated subsidiaries as well as lower equity earnings for our jvs

pending acquisition 

energy future holdings corp 

on august 21 2017 sempra energy entered into an agreement and plan of merger as supplemented by a waiver agreement dated october 3 2017 and an amendment dated february 15 2018 together referred to as the merger agreement with energy future holdings corp the indirect owner of 8003 percent of oncor electric delivery company llc oncor is a regulated electric distribution and transmission business that operates the largest distribution and transmission system in texas following closing this acquisition will expand our regulated earnings base while serving as a platform for future growth in the texas energy market and us gulf coast region under the merger agreement we will pay the merger consideration of 945 billion in cash pursuant to the merger agreement and subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions described below efh will be merged with an indirect subsidiary of sempra energy with efh continuing as the surviving company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of sempra energy the merger the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and a related letter agreement with oncor are described in more detail in sempra energy’s current reports on form 8k filed with the sec on august 25 2017 august 28 2017 and october 6 2017 the amendment dated february 15 2018 the amendment was made in connection with a settlement agreement dated as of february 5 2018 by and among the parties to the merger agreement and certain of their subsidiaries the amendment amends certain merger terms in accordance with the settlement agreement that relate to oncor dividend payments and certain adjustments to the merger consideration the amendment is provided in its entirety by reference to exhibit 213 filed herewith 

ringfencing 

in april 2014 efh and the substantial majority of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy court the bankruptcy does not include oncor or oncor holdings oncor holdings owns 8003 percent of oncor and is indirectly wholly owned by efh certain existing “ringfencing” measures governance mechanisms and restrictions will remain in effect following the merger which are intended to enhance oncor holdings’ and oncor’s separateness from their owners and to mitigate the risk that these entities would be negatively impacted by the bankruptcy of or other adverse financial developments affecting efh or its other subsidiaries or the owners of efh in accordance with the ringfencing measures and commitments made by sempra energy as part of the joint application to the puct for regulatory approval of the merger sempra energy and oncor will be subject to certain restrictions following the merger sempra energy will not control oncor holdings or oncor and the ringfencing measures governance mechanisms and restrictions as well as the stipulation discussed below and elsewhere herein will limit our ability to direct the management policies and operations of oncor holdings and oncor including the deployment or disposition of their assets declarations of dividends strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions thus oncor holdings and oncor will continue to be managed independently ie ringfenced upon consummation of the merger although we will consolidate efh efh will continue to account for its ownership in oncor holdings as an equity method investment 

settlement agreement regarding joint application 

on october 5 2017 sempra energy and oncor filed a joint application with the puct and an application with the ferc seeking approval of the merger in december 2017 sempra energy and oncor entered into a comprehensive stipulation with the staff of the puct the office of the public utility counsel the steering committee of cities served by oncor and the texas industrial energy consumers reflecting the parties’ settlement of all issues in the puct proceeding regarding the joint application pursuant to the stipulation the parties have agreed that sempra energy’s acquisition of efh is in the public interest and will bring substantial benefits the parties to the stipulation also agreed to ask the puct to approve the merger consistent with the governance regulatory and operating commitments outlined in the stipulation 

the stipulation includes regulatory commitments by us as described below and elsewhere herein most of which are similar to the regulatory commitments made by us as part of the joint application and are consistent with the “ringfencing” measures currently in place sempra energy and oncor are entitled to seek modifications of the puct order to be entered in the proceedings regarding the joint application which modifications would be subject to puct approval 

while oncor’s limited liability company agreement generally provides that oncor will make quarterly distributions to its members equal to the net income of oncor subject to certain exceptions and oncor holdings’ limited liability company agreement generally provides that oncor holdings will make quarterly distributions to its member equal to the dividends received by oncor subject to certain exceptions the stipulation provides a number of circumstances in which oncor is not permitted to make dividends or other distributions except for contractual tax payments in addition the stipulation provides that the respective boards of oncor and oncor holdings will control each respective company’s dividend policy and any changes to such policy must be approved by a majority of its independent directors issuances of dividends and other distributions except for contractual tax payments the stipulation also provides that the respective boards of oncor and oncor holdings will control each respective company’s debt issuances capital expenditures operation and maintenance expenditures management and service fees and subject to certain limitations appointment or removal of board members 

if the puct does not accept the stipulation as presented or issues an order inconsistent with the terms of the stipulation the parties have agreed that any party adversely affected by the alteration has the right to withdraw from the stipulation and to exercise all rights available to such party under the law 

on january 5 2018 oncor sempra energy and staff of the puct jointly filed with the puct requesting that the puct approve the merger consistent with the stipulation as of january 31 2018 all 10 intervening parties including the staff of the puct agreed to the stipulation 

we discuss the merger and financing of the merger consideration ringfencing measures additional regulatory commitments governance mechanisms and restrictions as well as the stipulation in notes 3 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements “item 1a risk factors” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations –  factors influencing future performance” 

closing conditions 

the merger is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of the puct certain conditions such as approval from the bankruptcy court the ferc the vermont department of financial regulation and receipt of a private letter ruling from the irs have been satisfied if the required governmental consents and approvals are not received or if they are not received on terms that satisfy the closing conditions in the merger agreement the merger could be abandoned delayed or restructured 

the merger agreement provides that it will terminate if the merger is not consummated by april 18 2018 subject to limited exceptions one of those exceptions provides that if the merger is not consummated because the requisite puct approval has not been obtained by april 18 2018 but such approval is still capable of being obtained within 90 days thereafter the april 18 2018 date shall be extended for 90 days for purposes of continuing to pursue such approval unless otherwise agreed by efh and efih acting together and sempra energy 

we currently expect that the merger will close in the first half of 2018 although there can be no assurance that the merger will be completed on that timetable or at all 

our segments 

no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of sempra energy’s consolidated revenues in 2017 2016 or 2015 

sdge 

sdge is a regulated public utility that provides electric services to a population of approximately 36 million and natural gas services to approximately 33 million of that population covering a 4100 square mile service territory in southern california that encompasses san diego county and an adjacent portion of southern orange county 

electric utility operations 

customers and demand  sdge provides electric services through the generation transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes 



 

no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of sdge’s revenues from electricity sold in 2017 2016 or 2015 

sdge’s system average rate is based on authorized revenue requirements divided by authorized sales volumes sdge’s system average rate was 0238 0206 and 0218 per kwh in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the 2017 increase compared to 2016 was primarily the result of undercollected power costs in 2016 the 2016 decrease compared to 2015 was driven by the inclusion in 2015 of undercollections associated with activities prior to 2015 including the delay in implementing into rates the increases associated with the 2012 grc a significant proportion of sdge’s costs to operate are independent of sales volumes which can contribute to system average rate variances as sales volumes change 

an electric utility’s system average rate can be affected by numerous factors which are not necessarily common to other utilities regionally or nationally in general the utilization of a typical electric utility’s distribution assets is significantly less than their capacity because the assets are designed to meet peak needs compared to the typical utility in the us sdge delivers a higher relative percentage of its total power sold to residential customers who on average consume less power than an average commercial customer san diego’s mild climate and sdge’s robust energy efficiency programs also contribute to lower consumption by our customers in addition rooftop solar installations especially in recent years have reduced residential and commercial volumes sold by sdge as of december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 the residential and commercial rooftop solar capacity in sdge’s territory totaled 836 mw 694 mw and 496 mw respectively all these factors contribute to generally higher system average rates where the cost of building and operating our assets is spread over a relatively smaller sales volume 

in addition to these factors sdge’s cpucapproved rate design includes a tiered residential pricing structure we discuss electric rate reform further in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” 

demand for electricity is dependent on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products consumer preference environmental regulations legislation renewable power generation the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs demandside management goals and distributed generation resources california’s energy policy supports increased electrification particularly electrification of vehicles which could result in significant increases in sales volumes in the coming years other external factors such as the price of purchased power the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in the market price of electricity which may in turn impact demand demand for electricity is also impacted by seasonal weather patterns or “seasonality” tending to increase in the summer months to meet cooling load and in the winter months to meet heating load 

electric resources  to meet customer demand sdge procures power from its own electric generation facilities and from other suppliers through cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts or through purchases on a spot basis sdge’s supply as of december 31 2017 is as follows 



 

sdge is required to interconnect with and purchase power from qfs a class of generating facilities established by the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 at rates that do not exceed sdge’s avoided cost for sdge qfs include cogeneration facilities which produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy such as heat or steam used for industrial commercial residential or institutional purposes charges under most of the contracts with qfs are based on what it 

would incrementally cost sdge to produce the power or procure it from other sources charges under the contracts with other suppliers are for firm and asgenerated energy and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity tolling contracts are purchasedpower contracts under which sdge provides natural gas for generation to the energy supplier the prices under these contracts include 193 mw at prices that are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated 

sdge provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a longterm basis as shown above while sdge provides such procurement service for the majority of its customer load customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than sdge through programs such as da and cca da is currently closed to new entrants but utility customers can receive procurement through cca if the customer’s local jurisdiction city offers such a program a number of cities in our service territory have expressed interest in cca which if widely adopted could result in substantial reductions in the load we are required to serve for example solana beach representing less than 1 percent of sdge’s customer accounts has elected to begin cca service in 2018 when customers are served by another load serving entity sdge no longer serves this departing load and the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources are otherwise borne by its remaining bundled procurement customers the cpuc has tried to address this issue by adopting rate mechanisms that attempt to ensure bundled customer indifference in the event of departing load but these existing mechanisms may not be sufficient to address the full extent of the potential cost shift in the event of significant departing load and sdge bears some risk that its procured resources could become stranded without recovery of the associated costs 

natural gas supply for generation facilities sdge procures natural gas under shortterm contracts for its owned generation facilities and for certain tolling contracts associated with purchasedpower arrangements purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

power pool sdge is a participant in the western systems power pool which includes an electricpower and transmissionrate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities power agencies energy brokers and power marketers located throughout the us and canada participants can make power transactions on standardized terms including marketbased rates preapproved by the ferc participation in the western systems power pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk 

electric transmission and distribution system service to sdge’s customers is supported by its electric transmission and distribution system at december 31 2017 sdge’s electric transmission and distribution facilities included substations and overhead and underground lines these electric facilities are in san diego imperial and orange counties of california and in arizona and nevada the facilities consist of 2090 miles of transmission lines 23479 miles of distribution lines and 160 substations periodically various areas of the service territory require expansion to accommodate customer growth reliability and safety 

sdge’s 500kv southwest powerlink transmission line which is shared with arizona public service company and imperial irrigation district extends from palo verde arizona to san diego california sdge’s share of the line is 1162 mw although it can be less under certain system conditions sdge’s sunrise powerlink is a 500kv transmission line constructed and operated by sdge with import capability of 1000 mw of power 

mexico’s baja california transmission system is connected to sdge’s system via two 230kv interconnections with combined capacity of up to 408 mw in the northtosouth direction and 800 mw in the southtonorth direction although it can be less under certain system conditions 

edison’s transmission system is connected to sdge’s system via five 230kv transmission lines 

competition sdge faces competition to serve its customer load from the growth in distributed and local power generation including rooftop solar installations battery storage and the corresponding decrease in demand for power delivered through sdge’s electric transmission and distribution system and from possible departing retail load resulting from customers transferring to da and cca sdge does not earn any return on commodity sales

california utilities natural gas utility operations 

customers and demand 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers and sdge’s core customers on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others 



 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the california utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers a substantial portion of socalgas’ revenues are from core customers 

noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial and industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers a portion of socalgas’ noncore customers are nonendusers socalgas’ nonendusers include wholesale customers consisting primarily of other ious including sdge or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers 

noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements as the regulatory framework does not allow us to recover the actual cost of natural gas procured and delivered to noncore customers 

no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of socalgas’ or sdge’s revenues from natural gas operations in 2017 2016 or 2015 

demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products consumer preference environmental regulations legislation california’s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs other external factors such as weather the price of electricity the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas outside the state of california and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price which may in turn impact demand 

one of the larger sources for natural gas demand is electric generation natural gasfired electric generation within southern california and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity growth in renewable generation including rooftop solar the addition of more efficient gas technologies new energy efficiency initiatives and the extent that regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the california utilities’ respective service areas the demand for natural gas may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to climate change weather conditions and other impacts and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources given the significant quantity of natural gasfired generation natural gas is the dispatchable fuel of choice to help ensure electric reliability in our california service territories 

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and cash provided from operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry but subject to current regulatory limitations socalgas usually injects natural gas into storage during the summer months april through october which reduces cash provided by operating activities during this period and usually withdraws natural gas from storage during the winter months november through march which increases cash provided by operating activities when customer demand is higher 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

at december 31 2017 socalgas’ natural gas facilities include 2964 miles of transmission and storage pipelines 50577 miles of distribution pipelines 47779 miles of service pipelines and nine transmission compressor stations while sdge’s natural gas facilities consist of 168 miles of transmission pipelines 8928 miles of distribution pipelines 6503 miles of service pipelines and one compressor station 

socalgas purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the california utilities’ residential and smaller business customers socalgas purchases natural gas from various sources including from canada the us rockies and the southwestern regions of the us purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

to help ensure the delivery of natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company pge and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california 

natural gas storage 

socalgas owns four natural gas storage facilities these facilities have a combined working gas capacity of 137 bcf and have over 200 injection withdrawal and observation wells that provide natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers socalgas’ and sdge’s core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas’ storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others including sdge for its noncore customer requirements through an open bid process natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for ensuring service reliability during peak demand periods including heating needs in the winter as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility represents 63 percent of socalgas’ natural gas storage capacity socalgas discovered a natural gas leak at one of its wells at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in october 2015 and permanently sealed the well in february 2016 socalgas ceased 

injecting natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility on october 25 2015 pursuant to orders from doggr and the governor of california and sb 380 limited withdrawals and injections of natural gas at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were authorized to recommence in 2017 we discuss the aliso canyon natural gas leak in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

sempra south american utilities 

sempra south american utilities develops owns and operates or holds interests in electric transmission distribution and generation infrastructure through its two utilities chilquinta energía in chile and luz del sur in peru it also owns interests in two energyservices companies tecnored and tecsur that provide electric construction and infrastructure services to chilquinta energía and luz del sur respectively as well as third parties tecnored also sells electricity to nonregulated customers 

chilquinta energía sa 

chilquinta energía a wholly owned subsidiary of sempra south american utilities is an electric distribution utility serving a population of approximately two million in the region of valparaíso in central chile with a service area covering 4400 square miles chilquinta energía also serves a population of approximately 130000 in the communities of parral and linares in the southcentral region of maule in chile chilquinta energía is the third largest distributor of electricity in chile with close to a 10percent share of the market 

customers and demand chilquinta energía provides electric services through the transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes 



in chile customers are classified as regulated and nonregulated customers based on installed capacity regulated customers are those whose installed capacity is less than 500 kw nonregulated customers are those whose installed capacity is greater than 5000 kw customers with installed capacity between 500 kw and 5000 kw may choose to be classified as regulated or nonregulated nonregulated customers that can buy power from other sources such as directly from the generator are classified as tolling customers both regulated and nonregulated customers pay transmission and distribution tariffs for the transportation of their electricity through the system there is no risk of stranded costs for chilquinta energía because ppas with generators are not takeorpay contracts rather chilquinta energía only purchases power taken by its customers 

chilquinta energía’s system average rate excluding tolling customers was 0164 0168 and 0165 per kwh in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

demand for electricity depends on the growth and stability of the chilean economy customer growth and preferences prices policies and environmental regulations driving the substitution of alternative energy products for wood and coal legislation and energy policy supporting increased electrification of the public and private transportation sector and the effectiveness and expansion of energy efficiency programs and distributed generation resources 

the price of electricity can be affected by the growth of renewable power generation the amount of hydroelectric power the market price of oil and natural gas and transmission and distribution service tariffs which may in turn also impact demand for electricity 

other factors that can affect the demand for electricity include weather and seasonality demand for electricity at chilquinta energía is higher in the winter months to meet heating load and tends to decrease during the mild temperatures in the summer months 

electric resources  the supply of electric power available to chilquinta energía comes from purchasedpower contracts currently in place with various suppliers the supply as of december 31 2017 was as follows 

1 contracts with fuel sources that include natural gas coal or diesel are collectively referred to as thermal 

power generation system the national electric system is operated and coordinated by the national electric coordinator coordinador eléctrico nacional this institution is managed by a directive council consejo directivo formed by five members designated through a public tender this entity coordinates the operation of the nationwide interconnected electric system 

transmission system and access at december 31 2017 chilquinta energía’s electric facilities include 10227 miles of distribution lines 352 miles of transmission lines and 49 substations chilquinta energía also owns a 50percent interest in eletrans which operates a 97mile double circuit 220kv transmission line in the atacama region of northern chile and a 46mile double circuit 220kv transmission line in the los rios region of southern chile 

transmission lines in chile are either part of the main transmission system the national system or the subtransmission system the zonal system subtransmission systems including those owned by chilquinta energía are comprised of infrastructure that is interconnected to the electricity system to supply nonregulated and regulated endusers located in the distribution service area 

we discuss ongoing transmission line projects at chilquinta energía’s joint ventures in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” 

competition  chilquinta energía faces limited competition from the growth in rooftop solar installations as electricity prices remain competitive and tariffs compensate selfgenerators only for the commodity component of the energy delivered to the grid presently there are no public programs or incentives promoting the adoption of distributed energy generation 

in addition the national electric coordinator will be tendering a significant number of projects divided between extension work and new development work for subtransmission systems the new development projects in these tenders will be opened to independent developers allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for their construction and operation 

luz del sur saa 

sempra south american utilities owns 836 percent of luz del sur an electric distribution utility that serves a population of approximately 49 million in the southern zone of metropolitan lima peru with a service area covering approximately 1394 square miles luz del sur delivers approximately onethird of all power used in peru the remaining shares of luz del sur are held by noncontrolling interests and trade on the lima stock exchange bolsa de valores de lima under the symbol lusurc1 the shares are subject to regulation by the superintendencia del mercado de valores superintendency of securities market 

customers and demand luz del sur provides electric services through the generation transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes 



in peru customers are classified as regulated and nonregulated customers based on capacity demand regulated customers are those whose capacity demand is less than 200 kw and their energy supply is considered public service nonregulated customers which are free and tolling customers are those whose capacity demand is greater than 2500 kw customers with capacity demand between 200 kw and 2500 kw may choose to be classified as regulated or nonregulated free customers purchase power directly from a utility and pay the utility a fee for generation transmission primary and secondary and distribution services tolling customers purchase power from alternate suppliers and pay only a tolling fee to the utility for secondary transmission and distribution services utilities in peru including luz del sur generally have ppas with generators to serve their regulated and free customers’ load because the power purchased by luz del sur from generators is generally based on takeorpay contracts luz del sur is exposed to the risk of stranded costs associated with capacity charges as we discuss in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  factors influencing future performance” 

luz del sur’s system average rate excluding free and tolling customers was 0130 0122 and 0117 per kwh in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

demand for electricity depends on the stability and growth of the peruvian economy customer growth and usage preferences electricity prices legislation and energy policy supporting increased electrification within our service territory the price of electricity can be affected by changes in energy policy volatility of spot market prices the amount of hydroelectric power the market price of oil and natural gas changes in inflation and foreign exchange rates new technologies and transmission and distribution service tariffs which may also impact demand for electricity other factors that can affect the demand for electricity include weather and seasonality demand for electricity at luz del sur is higher in the summer months to meet cooling load and tends to decrease during the colder temperatures in the winter months 

electric resources the supply of electric power available to luz del sur comes from purchasedpower contracts currently in place with various suppliers its own electric generation facility or purchases made on an asneeded basis this supply as of december 31 2017 was as follows 



 based on guidelines established by the system operator in peru and historical water flows available excess 

capacity is sold in the spot market 

 

power generation system  the sistema eléctrico interconectado nacional sein is the peruvian national interconnected system the osinergmin in addition to setting tariffs supervises the bidding processes for energy purchases between distribution companies and generators 

the committee of economic operation of the national interconnected system comité de operación económica del sistema interconectado nacional coordinates the operation and dispatch of electricity of the sein 

transmission system and access at december 31 2017 luz del sur’s electric facilities consisted of 13966 miles of distribution lines 216 miles of transmission lines and 40 substations luz del sur also owns and operates santa teresa a 100mw hydroelectric power plant located in the cusco region of peru 

transmission lines in peru are divided into principal and secondary systems the principal system lines are accessible by all generators and allow the flow of energy through the national grid the secondary system lines connect principal transmission with the network of distribution companies or connect directly to certain final customers the transmission company receives tariff revenues and collects tolls based on a charge per unit of electricity 

we discuss ongoing transmission line and substation projects at luz del sur in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” 

competition  while electric distribution companies in peru are considered natural monopolies users consuming more than 200 kw are free to choose the company of their preference including luz del sur to provide them with electric power 

key noncash performance indicators 

key noncash performance indicators for our south american electric distribution utilities’ operations are customer count and consumption and transmission line losses additional noncash performance indicators include goals related to safety environmental considerations electric reliability and regulatory compliance 

sempra mexico 

our sempra mexico segment includes the operating companies of our subsidiary ienova as well as certain holding companies and risk management activity ienova develops builds and operates energy infrastructure in mexico and owns or holds interests in 

 sempra energy owns 664 percent of ienova with the remaining shares held by noncontrolling interests and traded on the mexican stock exchange under the symbol ienova the mexican national banking and securities commission comisión nacional bancaria y de valores or cnbv regulates the shares which are registered with the mexican national securities registry registro nacional de valores maintained by the cnbv we discuss ienova’s noncontrolling interests and its acquisition and divestiture activities in notes 1 and 3 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the following table provides information about sempra mexico’s facilities excluding its ecogas natural gas distribution facilities that were operational as of december 31 2017 





gas business 

pipelines and related assetsfacilities at december 31 2017 sempra mexico’s assetsfacilities consisted of 1353 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines 11 compressor stations 139 miles of ethane pipelines 118 miles of lpg pipelines and one lpg storage terminal in mexico these assets are contracted under longterm us dollarbased agreements with major industry participants such as the cfe cenagas pemex shell gazprom intergen nv and other similar counterparties 

in 2017 our pipeline assets in mexico had design capacity of approximately 16501 mmcf per day of natural gas 204 mmcf per day of ethane gas 106000 barrels per day of ethane liquid 34000 barrels per day of lpg transmission and 80000 barrels of lpg storage 

lng  sempra mexico operates its eca lng regasification terminal on land it owns in baja california mexico the eca lng regasification terminal is capable of processing 1 bcf of natural gas per day and generates revenues from reservation and usage fees under terminal capacity agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with shell and gazprom expiring in 2028 that permit them together to use onehalf of the terminal’s capacity 

in connection with sempra lng  midstream’s lng purchase agreement with tangguh psc sempra mexico purchases from sempra lng  midstream the lng delivered to eca by tangguh psc sempra mexico uses the natural gas produced from this lng and from natural gas purchased in the market or through sempra lng  midstream’s marketing operations to supply a contract for the sale of natural gas to mexico’s national electric company the cfe at prices that are based on the socal border index if lng volumes received from tangguh psc are not sufficient to satisfy the commitment to the cfe sempra mexico may purchase natural gas from sempra lng  midstream’s natural gas marketing operations 

the lng business is impacted by worldwide lng market prices high lng prices in markets outside the market in which ienova’s lng terminal operates have resulted and could continue to result in lower than expected deliveries of lng cargoes to the eca lng terminal from third parties under existing supply agreements which could increase costs if ienova is instead required to obtain lng in the open market at prevailing prices any inability to obtain expected lng cargoes could also impact ienova’s ability to maintain the minimum level of lng required to keep the eca lng terminal in operation at the proper temperature lng market prices also affect ienova’s lng marketing operations through which ienova must purchase natural gas in the international market to meet its contractual obligations to deliver natural gas to customers but which could have an adverse impact on its earnings which may be mitigated in part by the indemnity payments discussed below 

sempra mexico’s lng marketing operations sell natural gas to the cfe and other customers under supply agreements sempra mexico recognizes the revenue from the sale of natural gas upon transfer of the natural gas via pipelines to the customers at the agreed upon delivery points and in the case of the cfe at its thermoelectric power plants 

sempra lng  midstream has an agreement with sempra mexico to supply lng to the eca lng terminal although the lng purchase agreement specifies a number of cargoes to be delivered annually actual cargoes delivered have been significantly lower than the maximum specified under the agreement as a result sempra lng  midstream is contractually required to make monthly indemnity payments to sempra mexico for failure to deliver the contracted lng the revenues from the indemnity payments along with an amount for profit sharing allow sempra mexico to recover the costs of operating the eca lng terminal 

natural gas distribution   sempra mexico’s natural gas distribution utility ecogas operates in three separate distribution zones in mexico with approximately 2394 miles of pipeline and had approximately 120000 customer meters serving more than 400000 residential commercial and industrial consumers with sales volume of approximately 81 mmcf per day in 2017 

ecogas relies on affiliates sempra lng  midstream and socalgas for the supply and transportation of natural gas that it distributes to its customers if these affiliates fail to perform and ienova is unable to obtain supplies of natural gas from alternate sources ienova could lose customers and sales volume and could also be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility 

ecogas had been entitled to a 12year period of exclusivity with respect to each of its three distribution zones in mexicali chihuahua and la lagunadurango as the last of these exclusivity periods expired in 2011 ecogas could face competition from other distributors of natural gas in all of these distribution zones as other distributors of natural gas are now legally permitted to build natural gas distribution systems and compete with ecogas for customers 

power business 

wind power generation  sempra mexico develops invests in and operates renewable energy generation facilities that have longterm ppas to sell the electricity they generate to its customers which are generally load serving entities and industrial and other customers load serving entities sell electric service to their endusers and wholesale customers immediately upon receipt of 

our power delivery while industrial and other customers consume the electricity to run their facilities  in 2017 sempra mexico had contracted capacity of 330 mw for its ownership share of fully operating wind energy generation facilities 

natural gasfired generation tdm is a 625mw natural gasfired power plant located in mexicali baja california mexico that generates revenue from selling electricity andor resource adequacy to the caiso and to governmental public utility and wholesale power marketing entities it also has an ema with sempra lng  midstream for energy marketing scheduling and other related services to support its sales of generated power into the california electricity market under the ema tdm pays fees to sempra lng  midstream for these revenuegenerating services tdm also purchases fuel from sempra lng  midstream sempra mexico records revenue for the sale of power generated by tdm and records cost of sales for the purchases of natural gas and energy management services provided by sempra lng  midstream 

in february 2016 management approved a plan to market and sell tdm as a result we stopped depreciating the plant and classified the plant as held for sale we continue to actively pursue the sale of tdm which we expect to be completed in 2018 we discuss tdm further in notes 3 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

tdm competes daily with other generating plants that supply power into the california electricity market several of the wholesale markets supplied by merchant power plants have experienced significant pricing declines due to excess supply ienova manages commodity price risk at tdm by optimizing a mix of forward onpeak energy sales daily and hourly spot market sales of capacity energy and ancillary services and longerterm structured transactions as well as avoiding short positions   

demand and competition 

the overall demand for natural gas distribution services increases during the winter months conversely in the power business the overall demand for electricity is greater during the summer months 

ienova competes with mexican and foreign companies for certain new energy infrastructure projects in mexico and some of its competitors including but not limited to public or stateoperated companies their subsidiaries and affiliates may have better access to capital and greater financial and other resources which could give them a competitive advantage in bidding for such projects we discuss sempra mexico’s demand and competition further below 

key noncash performance indicators 

key noncash performance indicators for sempra mexico include sales volume plant or facility availability capacity utilization and for its distribution operations customer count and consumption additional noncash performance indicators include obtaining and completing on time and on budget major projects compliance with reliability and regulatory standards and goals related to safety environmental considerations and regulatory performance 

sempra renewables 

sempra renewables develops owns and operates or holds interests in solar and wind energy generation facilities in the us that have longterm ppas to sell the electricity and the related green energy attributes they generate to its customers which are generally load serving entities load serving entities sell electric service to their endusers and wholesale customers immediately upon receipt of our power delivery 

the majority of sempra renewables’ wind farm assets earn ptcs based on the number of megawatt hours of electricity they generate a ptc is a federal subsidy that provides an income tax incentive to windenergy producers at a flat rate for generating clean energy because ptcs last for ten years after project completion any wind turbine that is under construction before the end of 2019 will earn a full decade of ptcs at phasedout rates beginning with construction starting in 2017 through 2019 for each of the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  ptcs represented a large portion of our wind farm earnings often exceeding earnings from operations 

certain of sempra renewables’ wind and solar power facilities are held by limited liability companies whose members include financial institutions these financial institutions are noncontrolling tax equity investors to which earnings tax attributes and cash flows are allocated in accordance with the respective limited liability company agreements we discuss these tax equity arrangements in “variable interest entities” and in “noncontrolling interests” in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the following table provides information about the sempra renewables wind and solar energy generation facilities that were operational as of december 31 2017  the generating capacity of these facilities is fully contracted under longterm ppas for the periods indicated in the table 



 demand and competition 

generation from sempra mexico’s and sempra renewables’ renewable energy assets is susceptible to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind inclement weather and hours of sunlight 

sempra renewables’ future performance and the demand for renewable energy are impacted by various market factors most notably state mandated requirements to deliver a portion of total energy load from renewable energy sources the rules governing these requirements in california are generally known as the rps program in california certification of a generation project by the cec as an err allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements if such purchase meets the provisions of california sb x12 the rps program may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by sempra renewables and sempra mexico particularly the demand from california’s utilities we expect to receive err certification for all our renewable facilities operating in andor providing power to california including those at sempra mexico as they become operational additionally the phase out or extension of us federal income tax incentives primarily itcs and ptcs could significantly impact future renewable energy resource availability and investment decisions certain provisions of the tcja could reduce the value of tax benefits generated by our renewable projects and therefore make investments less attractive as well as reducing the size of the tax equity financing market which could lead to increased financing costs these impacts may be offset by a lower overall federal tax rate 

sempra renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity through its development of and investments in wind and solar power generation facilities sempra renewables also competes with other nonutility generators regulated utilities unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy service companies for sales of non 

contracted renewable energy the number and type of competitors may vary based on location generation type and project size also regulatory initiatives designed to enhance energy consumption from renewable resources for regulated utility companies may increase competition from these types of institutions these utilities may have a cost of capital that differs from most independent renewable power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate mechanisms this allows them to build buy and upgrade renewable generation projects without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments 

because sempra mexico sells the power that it generates at its energía sierra juárez wind power generation facility into california it is also impacted by these competitive factors 

our renewable energy competitors include among others

sempra lng  midstream 

sempra lng  midstream develops owns and operates or holds interests in lng and natural gas midstream assets and operations in alabama louisiana mississippi and texas including 

 lng 

sempra lng  midstream and three project partners hold interests in the cameron lng jv for the development construction and operation of a threetrain natural gas liquefaction export facility at the existing cameron lng llc regasification terminal in hackberry louisiana a project developed and permitted by sempra lng  midstream 

beginning from the october 1 2014 joint venture effective date cameron lng llc was no longer wholly owned and sempra lng  midstream began accounting for its 502percent equity interest in the joint venture under the equity method the joint venture began construction in the second half of 2014 on the natural gas liquefaction export facility using the existing regasification infrastructure contributed by sempra lng  midstream the joint venture has authorization to export lng to both fta and nonfta countries 

the existing regasification terminal is capable of processing 15 bcf of natural gas per day and from 2009 through 2017 it generated revenue under a terminal services agreement for approximately 375 bcf of natural gas storage and associated sendout rights of approximately 600 mmcf of natural gas per day the agreement allowed the customer to pay capacity reservation and usage fees to use the facilities to receive store and regasify the customer’s lng in december 2017 cameron lng jv terminated the regasification terminal services agreement as progress on the construction of the threetrain liquefaction project requires that certain terminal infrastructure be taken offline the revenues associated with the terminal services agreement have been included in the equity earnings generated from cameron lng jv 

the three liquefaction trains are designed to a nameplate capacity of 139 mtpa of lng with an expected export capability of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf per day cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with engie sa and affiliates of mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd which subscribe the full nameplate capacity of three trains at the facility in addition cameron lng jv is working on the development of up to two additional trains we discuss cameron lng jv in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the construction of the first three trains and the potential for an additional two trains in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

sempra energy is also taking steps to explore the development of additional lng export facilities at sempra lng  midstream’s port arthur texas property and sempra mexico’s eca regasification facility we discuss these opportunities in “item 7 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” and in “item 1a risk factors” 

demand and competition technological advances associated with shale gas and tight oil production have significantly reduced the need for north american lng import facilities and increased interest in liquefaction and export opportunities 

at current forward gas prices us gulf coast liquefaction is among the most price competitive potential lng supply in the world brownfield liquefaction is particularly price competitive resulting from many factors including 

 global lng competition may limit us lng exports as international liquefaction projects attempt to match us gulf coast lng production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility host governments for international liquefaction projects are altering fiscal and tax regimes in an effort to make projects in their jurisdictions competitive relative to us projects however sustained low oil prices may cause some of the international projects to become unfeasible due to their lng price formulas’ link to oil prices it is expected that us lng exports will increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand and thereby facilitate development of a global commodity market for natural gas and lng 

our lng liquefaction business’ major domestic and international competitors will include among others the following companies and their related lng affiliates 



additionally our cameron lng jv partners affiliates of engie sa mitsubishi corporation through a related company jointly established with nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha and mitsui  co ltd compete globally to market and sell lng to end users including gas and electric utilities located in lng importing countries around the world by providing liquefaction services cameron lng jv will compete indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global lng market in addition to the us these competitors are located in the middle east southeast asia africa south america australia and europe 

midstream 

sempra lng  midstream has 42 bcf of operational working natural gas storage capacity and a development project as follows 

 demand and competition  the natural gas storage business depends on market forecasts of seasonal natural gas prices and cash provided from operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months as is 

prevalent in the industry sempra lng  midstream customers usually inject natural gas into storage during the summer months april through october and usually withdraw natural gas from storage during the winter months november through march when customer demand is higher 

within their respective market areas sempra lng  midstream’s and sempra mexico’s pipeline businesses and sempra lng  midstream’s storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines they compete primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets 

sempra lng  midstream’s competitors include among others 



sempra mexico’s competitors include among others 



marketing operations 

sempra lng  midstream provides natural gas marketing trading and risk management services through the utilization and optimization of contracted natural gas supply transportation and storage capacity as well as optimizing its assets in the shortterm services market additionally it sells electricity under shortterm and longterm contracts and into the spot market and other competitive markets 

sempra lng  midstream’s marketing operations have an lng purchase agreement with tangguh psc for the supply of the equivalent of 500 mmcf of natural gas per day from tangguh psc’s indonesian liquefaction facility with delivery to sempra mexico’s eca lng receipt terminal at a price based on the socal border index for natural gas the lng purchase agreement allows tangguh psc to divert deliveries to other global markets in exchange for cash differential payments to sempra lng  midstream sempra lng  midstream also may enter into shortterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified at the terminal for sale to other parties 

in addition to lng if deliveries of lng cargoes are not sufficient sempra lng  midstream is also contracted to sell natural gas to sempra mexico that allows sempra mexico to satisfy its obligation under supply agreements with the cfe and other customers and to supply the tdm power plant these revenues are adjusted for indemnity payments and profit sharing as discussed in “sempra mexico – gas business – lng” above 

sempra lng  midstream also has an ema with sempra mexico to provide energy marketing scheduling and other related services to sempra mexico’s tdm power plant to support its sales of generated power into the california electricity market we discuss the ema in “sempra mexico – power business – natural gasfired generation” above 

key noncash performance indicators 

key noncash performance indicators at sempra lng  midstream include natural gas sales volume plant or facility availability and capacity utilization additional noncash performance indicators include goals related to safety environmental considerations and regulatory compliance and ontime and onbudget completion of development projects 

regulation 

california state utility regulation 

the california utilities are principally regulated at the state level by the cpuc the cec and the carb  

the cpuc 

 the cpuc also oversees and regulates new products and services including solar and wind energy bioenergy alternative energy storage and other forms of renewable energy in addition the cpuc’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety violations 

the cec publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based on these forecasts the cec 

 the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the california utilities’ longterm investment decisions 

the state of california requires certain california electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver a percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the rps program we discuss this requirement as it applies to sdge in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” 

california ab 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 assigns responsibility to carb for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing ghg emissions the bill requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a department within the california environmental protection agency an organization that reports directly to the governor’s office in the executive branch of california state government sempra lng  midstream and sempra mexico are also subject to the rules and regulations of carb we provide further discussion of ghg allowances and emissions in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the operation and maintenance of socalgas’ natural gas storage facilities are regulated by doggr as well as various other state and local agencies we provide further discussion of doggr’s increased regulations in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” 

us utility regulation 

the california utilities are also regulated at the federal level by the ferc the nrc the epa the doe and the dot 

the ferc regulates the california utilities’ interstate sale and transportation of natural gas and the application of the uniform systems of accounts in the case of sdge the ferc also regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access rates of return on transmission investment rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale the energy policy act governs procedures for requests for transmission service the ferc approved the california ious transfer of operation and control of their transmission facilities to the caiso in 1998 

the nrc oversees the licensing construction operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities in the us including songs in which sdge owns a 20percent interest and which has been permanently retired since 2013 nrc and various state regulations require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities we provide further discussion of songs matters including the closure and pending decommissioning of the facility in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the dot through phmsa has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures applicable to the california utilities’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines the dot has certified the cpuc to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in california the phmsa also is in the process of promulgating regulations applicable to the california utilities’ natural gas storage facilities see “other us regulation” below and further discussion in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” 

other state and local regulation within the us 

the scaqmd is the air pollution control agency responsible for regulating stationary sources of air pollution in the south coast air basin in southern california the district’s territory covers all of orange county and the urban portions of los angeles san bernardino and riverside counties 

socalgas has natural gas franchises with the 12 counties and the 223 cities in its service territory these franchises allow socalgas to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration date some franchises have fixed expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2062 

sdge has electric franchises with the two counties and the 27 cities in or adjoining its electric service territory and natural gas franchises with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory these franchises allow sdge to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity andor natural gas most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration dates some natural gas and some electric franchises have fixed expiration dates that range from 2021 to 2035 

other us regulation 

the ferc regulates certain sempra renewables and sempra lng  midstream assets pursuant to the federal power act and natural gas act which provide for ferc jurisdiction over among other things sales of wholesale power in interstate commerce transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and siting and permitting of lng terminals in addition certain sempra renewables power generation assets are required under the federal power act to comply with reliability standards developed by the north american electric reliability corporation bay gas’ natural gas storage operations are also regulated by the alabama public service commission 

sempra lng  midstream’s investment in cameron lng jv is subject to regulations of the doe regarding the export of lng 

the ferc may regulate rates and terms of service based on a costofservice approach or in geographic and product markets determined by the ferc to be sufficiently competitive rates may be marketbased fercregulated rates at the following businesses are 

 the california utilities sempra lng  midstream and businesses that sempra lng  midstream invests in are subject to the dot rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety phmsa acting through the office of pipeline safety is responsible for administering the dot’s national regulatory program to assure the safe transportation of natural gas petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines including pipelines associated with natural gas storage and develops regulations and other approaches to risk management to assure safety in design construction testing operation maintenance and emergency response of pipeline facilities the california utilities sempra lng  midstream sempra renewables and sempra mexico are also subject to regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission 

foreign regulation 

sempra south american utilities has two utilities in south america that are subject to laws and regulations in the localities and countries in which they operate these utilities serve primarily regulated customers and their revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the cne in chile and the osinergmin in peru as we discuss below in “ratemaking mechanisms – sempra south american utilities” 

operations and projects in our sempra mexico segment are subject to regulation by the cre the mexican safety energy and environment agency agencia de seguridad energía y ambiente the mexican secretary of energy secretaría de energía and other labor and environmental agencies of city state and federal governments in mexico 

licenses and permits 

the california utilities obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses for the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets including electric generation and natural gas storage facilities some of which may require periodic renewal 

sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses for their electric and natural gas distribution generation and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided the respective energy ministries in chile or peru granted the concessions to operate chilquinta energía’s and luz del sur’s distribution operations for indefinite terms not requiring renewal the permits for generation transportation storage and distribution operations at sempra mexico are generally for 30year terms with options for renewal under certain regulatory conditions 

sempra mexico and sempra lng  midstream obtain licenses and permits for the construction operation and expansion of lng facilities and the import and export of lng and natural gas sempra mexico also obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of terminals for the receipt storage and delivery of liquid fuels 

sempra renewables obtains permits authorizations and licenses for the construction and operation of power generation facilities and for the wholesale distribution of electricity 

sempra lng  midstream obtains permits authorizations and licenses for the construction and operation of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines and in connection with participation in the wholesale electricity market 

most of the permits and licenses associated with construction and operations within the sempra renewables and sempra lng  midstream businesses are for periods generally in alignment with the construction cycle or life of the asset and in many cases are greater than 20 years 

ratemaking mechanisms 

california utilities 

general rate case proceedings a cpuc grc proceeding is designed to set sufficient base rates to allow the california utilities to recover their reasonable cost of operations and maintenance and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investment the proceeding generally establishes the test year revenue requirements which authorizes how much the california utilities can collect from their customers and provides for attrition or annual increases in revenue requirements for each year following the test year the cpuc generally conducts a grc every three years 

cost of capital proceedings  a cpuc cost of capital proceeding determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base which is a weightedaverage of the authorized returns on debt preferred stock and common equity referred to as return on equity or roe weighted on a basis consistent with the authorized capital structure the authorized return on rate base approved by the cpuc is the rate that the california utilities use to establish customer rates to recover costs incurred to finance investments in cpucregulated electric distribution and generation as well as natural gas distribution and transmission assets 

a cost of capital proceeding also addresses the automatic ccm which applies marketbased benchmarks to determine whether an adjustment to the authorized return on rate base is required during the interim years between cost of capital proceedings the ccm did not operate in 2017 but could operate in 2018 to change the rates effective for january 1 2019 the marketbased benchmark for sdge’s and socalgas’ ccm is the 12month average monthly arated utility bond index as published by moody’s for the 12month period from october 1st through september 30th ccm period of each calculation year remaining unchanged from the last cost of capital proceeding sdge’s and socalgas’ ccm benchmark rate was set at 424 percent if at the end of the ccm period the monthly average benchmark rate falls outside of the established range of 324 percent to 524 percent sdge’s and socalgas’ authorized roe would be adjusted upward or downward by onehalf of the difference between the 12month average and the benchmark rate in addition the authorized recovery rate for sdge’s and socalgas’ cost of debt and preferred stock would be adjusted to their respective actual weightedaverage costs with no change to the authorized capital structure all three adjustments with the new rate would become effective on january 1st of the following year in which the benchmark range was exceeded 

the ccm only applies during the intervening years between scheduled cost of capital proceedings in the year the cost of capital proceeding is scheduled the cost of capital proceeding takes precedence over the ccm and will set new rates for the following year  the next cost of capital proceeding is scheduled to be filed in april 2019 for a january 1 2020 implementation 

we also discuss the cost of capital and ccm in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

transmission rate cases  sdge files separately with the ferc for its authorized roe on fercregulated electric transmission operations and assets the to4 settlement agreement approved by the ferc in may 2014 and in effect through december 31 2018 established a 1005 percent roe the settlement also established 1 a process whereby rates are determined using a base period of historical costs and a forecast of capital investments and 2 a trueup period similar to balancing account treatment that is designed to provide sdge earnings of no more and no less than its actual cost of service including its authorized return on investment sdge makes annual information filings on december 1 of each year to update rates for the following calendar year sdge also has the right to file for any roe incentives that might apply under ferc rules sdge’s debttoequity ratio will be set annually based on the actual ratio at the end of each year 

incentive mechanisms the cpuc applies performancebased measures and incentive mechanisms to all california ious under which the california utilities have earnings potential above authorized cpuc base operating margin if they achieve or exceed specific performance and operating goals generally for performancebased awards if performance is above or below specific benchmarks the utility is eligible for financial awards or subject to financial penalties 

sdge has incentive mechanisms associated with 

 socalgas has incentive mechanisms associated with 

 other costbased recovery the cpuc authorizes the california utilities to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs that they have been authorized to pass on to customers including the costs to purchase electricity and natural gas and those associated with administering public purpose demand response and customer energy efficiency programs actual costs are recovered as the commodity or service is delivered or to the extent actual amounts vary from forecasts generally recovered or refunded within a subsequent period based on the nature of the account overcollections and undercollections represent differences between cash collected in current rates and amounts due for specified components including costs depreciation and return on rate base probable of recovery from ratepayers the lagging aspect of overcollections and undercollections impacts cash flows until these respective amounts are trued up with collections from customers 

because changes in sdge’s and socalgas’ cost of electricity andor natural gas is substantially recovered in rates through a balancing account mechanism changes in these costs are offset in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings 

we also discuss regulatory matters in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sempra south american utilities 

chilquinta energía and luz del sur our electric distribution utilities in south america recognize revenues based on tariffs that are set by government agencies in their respective countries based on an efficient model distribution company defined by those agencies the tariffs are based on a model and are intended to cover the costs of the model company because the tariffs are not based on the costs of the specific utility they may not result in full cost recovery the tariffs are designed to provide for a passthrough to customers of transmission and energy charges recovery of reasonable operating and administrative costs incentives to reduce costs and make needed capital investments and a regulated rate of return on the distributor’s regulated asset base 

chilquinta energía’s revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the cne the cne’s review process for authorized distribution and transmission rates generally remains in effect for a period of four years the cne reviews rates for fouryear periods related to distribution and transmission separately on an alternating basis every two years 

luz del sur’s revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the osinergmin the components of tariffs for luz del sur are reviewed and adjusted every four years 

sempra mexico 

ecogas’ revenues are derived from service and distribution fees charged to its customers in pesos the price ecogas pays to purchase natural gas which is based on international price indices is passed through directly to its customers the service and distribution fees charged by ecogas are regulated by the cre which performs a review of rates every five years and monitors prices charged to endusers the tariffs operate under a returnonassetbase model in the annual tariff adjustment rates are adjusted to account for inflation or fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation indexing includes separate us and mexican cost components so that us costs can be included in the final distribution rates 

environmental matters 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “item 1a risk factors” you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions 

hazardous substances 

the cpuc’s hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allows california’s ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the california utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the california utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates 

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets 

air and water quality 

the electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent air quality and ghg standards such as those established by the carb and scaqmd the california utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards we discuss ghg standards and credits further in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we discuss environmental matters concerning socalgas’ aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” and in “item 1a risk factors”

 item 1a risk factors 

when evaluating our company and its subsidiaries you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report these risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf we may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of the following occurs our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially negatively impacted in addition the trading prices of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning our company set forth in or attached as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k including without limitation the information set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this section when we state that a risk or uncertainty may could or will have a “material adverse effect” on us or may could or will “materially adversely affect” us we mean that the risk or uncertainty may could or will as the case may be have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition prospects andor the trading prices of our securities or those of our subsidiaries 

risks related to sempra energy 

sempra energy’s cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and joint ventures and the ability to utilize the cash flows from those subsidiaries and joint ventures 

we are a holding company and substantially all of our assets are owned by our subsidiaries our ability to pay dividends and to meet our debt and other obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from our subsidiaries and joint ventures and other entities in which we have invested and in the short term our ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from our subsidiaries and joint ventures and other entities in which we have invested depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own expenditures common and preferred stock dividends and debt or other obligations in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us whether to enable us to pay principal and interest on our debt securities our other obligations or dividends on our common stock or our preferred stock and could be precluded from paying any such dividends or making any such loans or distributions under certain circumstances including without limitation as a result of legislation regulation court order contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress 

a significant portion of our worldwide cash reserves are generated by and therefore held in foreign jurisdictions as a result of the tcja enacted in december 2017 the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign entities were deemed repatriated and subjected to a onetime us federal income tax based on current assumptions when we repatriate these foreign earnings to the us in 2018 or later they will not be subject to additional us federal income taxes however some foreign jurisdictions and us states impose taxes on dividends repatriated to their us parent which will reduce the cash available to us 

the tcja may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows the value of investments in our common stock preferred stock and debt securities and our credit ratings 

the tcja has significantly changed the us internal revenue code including taxation of us corporations by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate altering the expensing of capital expenditures limiting interest deductions adopting elements of a territorial tax system assessing a onetime deemed repatriation tax on cumulative undistributed earnings of usowned foreign entities at the time of enactment and introducing certain antibase erosion provisions the legislation is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the us department of the treasury as well as state tax authorities and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation in addition the regulatory treatment of the impacts of this legislation will be subject to the discretion of the ferc and state public utility commissions 

we recorded a noncash income tax expense of 870 million  in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the effects of the enactment of the tcja we recorded the effects using our best estimates and the information available to us through the date the financial statements were issued however our analysis of this legislation is ongoing and the effects recorded are provisional as permitted by and in accordance with guidance issued by the sec we may adjust our provisional estimates in reporting periods throughout 2018 as we complete our analysis and as more information becomes available which could result in a material change in our provisional estimates we discuss the events and information that may result in adjustments to our provisional estimates in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations” 

although it is unclear when or how capital markets credit rating agencies the ferc or state public utility commissions may respond to the tcja we do expect that certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies such as our funds from operationstodebt percentage will be negatively impacted as a result of an anticipated decrease in required income tax reimbursement payments to us from our domestic utility subsidiaries due to the decrease in the us statutory corporate income tax rate certain provisions of the tcja such as 100percent expensing of capital expenditures and impacts on utilization of our nols may influence how we fund capital expenditures the timing of capital expenditures and possible redeployment of capital through sales or monetization of assets the timing of repatriation of foreign earnings and the use of equity financing to reduce our future use of debt although there can be no assurance that these strategies will reduce any potential adverse impact from these provisions of the tcja in addition although we are not currently expecting the deductibility of our interest costs to affect future earnings based on our method of allocation across our businesses the interest deduction limitation under the tcja is subject to potential additional guidance or interpretation from the us department of the treasury and there can be no assurance that any such additional guidance will not impact our current assessment 

it is also uncertain how credit rating agencies will treat the impacts of this legislation in their credit rating metrics and whether additional avenues will evolve for companies to manage the adverse aspects of this legislation we believe that these strategies to the extent available and if successfully applied could lessen the negative impacts on certain credit metrics such as our funds from operationstodebt percentage although there can be no assurance in this regard 

if we are unable to successfully take actions to manage the potentially adverse impacts of the tcja or if additional interpretations regulations amendments or technical corrections exacerbate any adverse impacts of the legislation it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and on the value of investments in our common stock preferred stock and debt securities and could result in credit rating agencies placing our credit ratings on negative outlook or downgrading our credit ratings any such actions by credit rating agencies may make it more difficult and costly for us to issue debt securities and certain other types of financing and could increase borrowing costs under our credit facilities 

we discuss the effects of the tcja further in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations” 

certain credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place those ratings on negative outlook which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

on december 20 2017 moody’s placed sempra energy’s credit ratings on negative outlook moody’s indicated that this action was triggered by us having entered into a comprehensive stipulation with the staff of the puct and other key stakeholders with 

respect to our joint application with oncor to the puct for regulatory approval of the merger which moody’s described as a significant milestone in our attaining regulatory approval for the merger in addition moody’s indicated that a downgrade of our credit ratings over the 12 to 18 months after december 20 2017 is likely if they anticipate that our consolidated credit metrics will remain weak relative to our current credit rating beyond 2019 specifically if our consolidated ratio of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital to debt remains below 18 percent assuming successful completion of the merger for an extended period of time moody’s also indicated that a downgrade could also be considered if there is a further delay in the completion of our cameron lng project sp has indicated that it could downgrade its rating of sempra energy’s senior unsecured debt securities within 12 months following october 9 2017 if we do not complete the merger or if the aggregate indebtedness of our subsidiaries continues to exceed 50 percent of our consolidated debt moody’s also issued a public comment on december 20 2017 regarding recent wildfires in northern california and ventura county california indicating that the december 6 2017 decision issued by the cpuc denying sdge’s request to recover approximately 379 million of pretax costs associated with the 2007 wildfires based on the cpuc’s finding that sdge did not reasonably operate the facilities involved in the wildfires is credit negative for sdge for sempra energy and for other california utilities seeking to recover costs from wildfires we discuss the 2007 wildfires further in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

moody’s further indicated that it may reassess its view of the california regulatory framework if it determines that the credit supportiveness of california’s regulatory environment has weakened including as a result of the cpuc’s discretion in denying recovery of wildfire costs which would also be credit negative and could lead to a downgrade of the credit ratings of california ious including sdge or those ratings being placed on negative outlook also as described in the preceding risk factor the tcja could materially adversely affect our credit ratings the negative outlook by moody’s any downgrade of our credit ratings by sp fitch ratings or moody’s or any additional negative outlook on our credit ratings may adversely affect the market price of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities and could make it more costly for us to issue debt securities to borrow under our credit facilities and to raise certain other types of financing as a result any additional negative outlook on sempra energy or any downgrade of sempra energy’s credit ratings by sp fitch ratings or moody’s could be a credit negative for sdge or socalgas or both and result in a downgrade of the credit ratings of sdge or socalgas or both the negative outlook or downgrade of sempra energy’s credit ratings by sp fitch ratings or moody’s or any additional negative outlook on sempra energy’s credit ratings may adversely affect the market price of socalgas’ preferred stock and both sdge’s and socalgas’ debt securities and could make it more costly for sdge and socalgas to issue debt securities to borrow under their credit facilities and to raise other types of financing 

conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations 

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments in difficult credit market environments we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support new or ongoing business activities this could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of servicing debt both of which could significantly reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings if socalgas or sdge were to have their credit ratings downgraded their cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and any downgrades of sempra energy’s credit ratings could materially adversely affect the cash flows and results of operations of sempra energy if the credit ratings of sempra energy or any of its subsidiaries were downgraded especially below investment grade financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require collateral in the form of cash a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition we discuss our credit ratings further in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and also above under “ –  certain credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place those ratings on negative outlook which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities” 

sempra energy has substantial investments in mexico and south america which expose us to foreign currency inflation legal tax economic geopolitical and management oversight risk 

we have significant foreign operations in mexico and south america our foreign operations pose complex management foreign currency inflation legal tax and economic risks certain of these risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic businesses all of our international businesses are sensitive to geopolitical uncertainties and our nonutility international businesses are sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers all of which 

may be driven by changes in their environments and potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions and various regional and local economic and political factors risks and uncertainties as well as us foreign policy foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on our revenue costs or cash flows from our international operations which could materially adversely affect our financial performance our currency exposures are to the mexican peruvian and chilean currencies our mexican subsidiaries have us dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities that give rise to mexican currency exchange rate movements for mexican income tax purposes they also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are significant denominated in the mexican peso that must be translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes in addition monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes our primary objective in reducing foreign currency risk is to preserve the economic value of our foreign investments and to reduce earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations we may attempt to offset material crosscurrency transactions and earnings exposure through various means including financial instruments and shortterm investments because we generally do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries we are susceptible to volatility in oci caused by exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to our south american subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities which makes us susceptible to volatility in income tax expense we discuss our foreign currency exposure at our mexican subsidiaries in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

mexico developed a legal framework for the regulation of the hydrocarbons and electric power sectors based on a package of constitutional amendments approved by the mexican congress in december 2013 and implementing legislation enacted in 2014 and the issuance of new regulations thereunder we have made significant investments in mexico based on this legal framework and should the legal framework be modified or withdrawn it may significantly reduce the value of our existing investments reduce investment opportunities and impact our decision to make further investments in mexico 

the current us administration indicated its intention to renegotiate trade agreements such as nafta and implement us immigration policy changes by reviewing various options including tariffs for funding new mexicous border security infrastructure such actions could result in changes in the mexican us and other markets in addition if this occurs the mexican government could implement retaliatory actions such as the imposition of restrictions or import fees on mexican imports of natural gas from the us or imports and exports of electricity to and from the us any of these actions by either or both governments could adversely affect imports and exports between mexico and the us and negatively impact the us and mexican economies and the companies with whom we conduct business in mexico which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects 

risks related to all sempra energy subsidiaries 

severe weather conditions natural disasters accidents equipment failures explosions or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by severe weather conditions natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes tsunamis floods mudslides and fires accidents equipment failures explosions or acts of terrorism because we are in the business of using storing transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials as well as radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure as well as the risks to the surrounding communities are substantially greater than the risks such incidents may pose to a typical business the facilities and infrastructure that we own or in which we have interests that may be subject to such incidents include but are not limited to 

 such incidents could result in severe business disruptions prolonged power outages property damage injuries or loss of life significant decreases in revenues and earnings andor significant additional costs to us such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners supply chains and transportation which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide natural gas and electricity to our customers any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires natural gas natural gas odorant propane or ethane leaks releases of other greenhouse gases radioactive releases explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties personal injuries health impacts or fatalities or present a nuisance to impacted communities any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us in some cases we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault such as in cases where the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies we discuss how the application of this doctrine in california has impacted sdge’s ability to recover certain costs associated with the 2007 wildfires in sdge’s territory and the proceedings related thereto in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations –  factors influencing future performance” in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and below under “risks related to the california utilities –  insurance coverage for future wildfires may be unobtainable prohibitively expensive or insufficient to cover losses we may incur and we may be unable to recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms” insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become prohibitively expensive may be disputed by the insurers or may become unavailable for certain of these risks or at sufficient levels and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to the existence of limitations exclusions high deductibles failure to comply with procedural requirements and other factors which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects in addition any inability to recover uninsured costs associated with wildfires or the perception that such costs may not be recoverable could materially adversely affect the trading prices of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

severe weather conditions may also impact our businesses including our international operations frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased the degree and prevalence of wildfires in california including in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories which could place third party property and our electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy and reduce the availability of hydroelectric generators which could result in temporary power shortages in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories in addition severe weather conditions could result in delays andor cost increases to our capital projects 

additionally severe rainstorms and associated high winds as well as flooding and mudslides where vegetation has been destroyed as result of human modification or wildfires along the coastal areas in our service territories could damage our electric and natural gas infrastructure resulting in increased expenses including higher maintenance and repair costs and interruptions in electricity and natural gas delivery services as a result these events can have significant financial consequences including regulatory penalties and disallowances if the california utilities or our utilities in mexico or south america encounter difficulties in restoring service to their customers on a timely basis further the cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process any such events could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and tax requirements and may be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulations or requirements or in their interpretation or implementation 

in recent years the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on the federal state and local levels these changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses moreover existing regulations laws and tariffs may be revised or reinterpreted and new regulations laws and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities special tariffs may also be imposed on components used in our businesses that could increase costs 

our businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements and the regulations laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs in addition to the tcja described above any new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations in the us and other countries in which we operate could materially adversely affect our tax expense andor tax balances and changes in tax policies could materially adversely impact our business changes in regulations laws and tariffs and how they are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the california utilities and other sempra energy businesses these rules are commonly referred to as “affiliate rules” which primarily impact commodity and commodityrelated transactions these businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or to their interpretations or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas to or to trade with the california utilities and with each other affiliate rules also restrict these businesses from entering into any such transactions with the california 

utilities any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the lng terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or other operations of our subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses require numerous permits licenses franchise agreements and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies any failure to obtain or maintain required permits licenses or approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

all of our existing and planned development projects require multiple approvals the acquisition construction ownership and operation of marine and inland liquid fuels lng and lpg terminals and storage natural gas pipelines and distribution and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution facilities and propane and ethane systems require numerous permits licenses franchise agreements certificates and other approvals from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies once received approvals may be subject to litigation and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed or modified in litigation in addition permits licenses franchise agreements certificates and other approvals may be modified rescinded or fail to be extended by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses socalgas’ franchise agreements with los angeles county and the city of los angeles where the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility is located are due to expire in 2018 and 2019 respectively if there is a delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be precluded from constructing or operating facilities or we may be forced to incur additional costs further accidents beyond our control may cause us to violate the terms of conditional use permits causing delays in projects any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain necessary permits licenses certificates and other approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations and mandates relating to environmental protection including air quality water quality and usage wastewater discharge solid waste management hazardous waste disposal and remediation conservation of natural resources wetlands and wildlife renewable energy resources climate change and ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees the california utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs for projects are not recoverable in rates in addition we may be ultimately responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our marine and inland liquid fuels lng and lpg terminals and storage natural gas transmission distribution and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution facilities and other energy projects and properties regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown which exposes us to risks arising from contamination at our former or existing facilities or with respect to offsite waste disposal sites that have been used in our operations in the case of our california and other regulated utilities some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates our facilities including those in our joint ventures are subject to laws and regulations protecting migratory birds which have been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to wind farms failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines andor significant curtailments of our operations which could materially adversely affect our cash flows andor results of operations 

increasing international national regional and statelevel environmental concerns as well as related new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed state national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations the implementation of recent and proposed california legislation and regulation may materially adversely affect our nonutility businesses by imposing among other things additional costs associated with emission limits controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits similarly california sb 350 requires all loadserving entities including sdge to file integrated resource plans that will ultimately enable the electric sector to achieve reductions in ghg emissions of 40 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030 our california utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates even if recoverable the effects of existing and proposed ghg emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth and may have a material adverse effect on the california utilities’ cash flows sdge may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

in addition existing and future laws orders and regulations regarding mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates methane or other emissions could result in requirements for additional monitoring pollution monitoring and control equipment safety practices or emission fees taxes or penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows 

we provide further discussion of these matters in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation against us 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and arbitration proceedings we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and proceedings and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings we discuss pending proceedings in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the uncertainties inherent in lawsuits arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part by insurance or in rates from our customers which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations andor financial condition 

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices in addition for those contract positions that are hedged our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition certain of the contracts we use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts in certain cases these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged 

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

although we have in place risk management and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended by our businesses or may not work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees 

several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a companybycompany basis any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

new business technologies implemented by us or developed by others present a risk for increased attacks on our information systems and the integrity of our energy grid and our natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure 

in addition to general information and cyber risks that all fortune 500 corporations face eg malware malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information smart grid infrastructure and natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure deployment of new business technologies represents a new and largescale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer information as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure while our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malware unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks to date we have not detected a material breach of 

cybersecurity addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across sempra energy’s businesses but we cannot assure that a successful attack has not occurred and will not occur an attack on our information systems the integrity of the energy grid our natural gas ethane or propane pipeline and storage infrastructure or one of our facilities or unauthorized access to confidential customer information could result in energy delivery service failures financial loss violations of privacy laws customer dissatisfaction and litigation any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

in the ordinary course of business sempra energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees customer energy usage and other information the theft damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws subject us to claims from third parties require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations and harm our reputation 

further as seen with recent cyberattacks around the world the goal of a cyberattack may be primarily to inflict largescale harm on a company and the places where it operates any such cyberattack could cause widespread disruptions to our operating financial and administrative systems including the destruction of critical information and programming that could materially adversely affect our business operations and the integrity of the power grid negatively impact our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements or comply with ongoing disclosure obligations or other regulatory requirements andor release confidential information about our company and our customers employees and other constituents any of which could lead to sanctions or negatively affect the general perception of our business in the financial markets and which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses will need to continue to adapt to technological change which may cause us to incur significant expenditures to adapt to these changes and which efforts may not be successful or such expenditures may not be recovered 

emerging technologies may be superior to or may not be compatible with some of our existing technologies investments and infrastructure and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive or may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets or the operating assets of our investees our future success will depend in part on our ability and our investment partners’ abilities to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets if we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological changes fail to adapt to significant technological changes fail to obtain access to important new technologies fail to recover a significant portion of any remaining investment in obsolete assets or if implemented technology fails to operate as intended our businesses operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected examples of technological changes that could negatively impact our businesses include 

 risks related to the california utilities 

the california utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may materially adversely affect us 

the cpuc regulates the california utilities’ rates except sdge’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates the california utilities’ 



 the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance safety standards and practices compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows socalgas and sdge may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines and storage and for sdge electric operations under regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety and citation programs concerning both gas and electric safety which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the california utilities’ rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in notes 13 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

the cpuc periodically approves the california utilities’ rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs including income taxes and an authorized rate of return on investment delays by the cpuc on decisions authorizing recovery afterthefact reasonableness reviews with unclear standards or authorizations for less than full recovery may adversely affect the working capital cash flows and financial condition of each of the california utilities if the california utilities receive an adverse cpuc decision andor actual capital expenditures andor operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the cpuc our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected reductions in key benchmark interest rates may trigger automatic adjustment mechanisms which would reduce the california utilities’ authorized rates of return changes in which could materially adversely affect their results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

socalgas and sdge have significantly invested and continue to invest in major programs such as psep under an approved cpuc decision tree framework however the total investment to date is substantially subject to cpuc reasonableness review although we believe these costs have been prudently incurred the standards applied by the cpuc could result in the disallowance of certain of these historical costs which could adversely affect sdge’s socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the cpuc now incorporates a riskbased decisionmaking framework in its review of grc applications for major natural gas and electric utilities in california we cannot estimate whether its application in the 2019 grc or future grc applications will result in full recovery of costs we discuss this further in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in california there are laws that establish rules governing among other subjects communications between cpuc officials cpuc staff and regulated utilities rules and processes around ex parte  communications could result in delayed decisions increased investigations enforcement actions and penalties in addition the cpuc or other parties may initiate investigations of past communications between public utilities and cpuc officials and staff that could result in reopening completed proceedings for reconsideration 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets and other similar matters involving sdge 

the california utilities may be materially adversely affected by new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies in addition existing legislation or regulations may be revised or reinterpreted new revised or reinterpreted legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how the california utilities operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses 

the construction and expansion of the california utilities’ natural gas pipelines socalgas’ storage facilities and sdge’s electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits licenses rightsofway and other approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies including approvals and renewals of rightsofway over native american tribal land held in trust by the federal government successfully maintaining or renewing any or all of these approvals could result in higher costs or in the event one or more of these approvals were to expire could require us to remove the associated assets from service construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area or both and our ability to recover higher costs associated with these events cannot be assured if there are delays in obtaining these approvals failure to obtain or maintain these approvals difficulties in renewing rightsofway and other property rights or failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations the california utilities’ businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be adversely affected 

successfully coordinating and completing expansion and construction projects requires good execution from our employees and contractors cooperation of third parties and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay in the event that one or more of these projects is delayed or experiences significant cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on the california utilities the california utilities may invest a significant amount of money in a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if the project does not receive regulatory approval if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes or if management decides not to proceed with the project they may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project which could materially adversely affect their financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

our california utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as turn utility consumers’ action network sierra club and other stakeholder advocacy and activist groups operations that may be influenced by these groups include 

 socalgas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs and expenses related to remediating the natural gas leak at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and to mitigate local community and environmental impacts from the leak some or a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance and socalgas also may incur significant liabilities for damages restitution fines penalties and other costs and ghg mitigation activities as a result of this incident some or a significant portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance 

in october 2015 socalgas discovered a leak at one of its injectionandwithdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility the leak located in the northern part of the san fernando valley in los angeles county california the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility has been operated by socalgas since 1972 ss25 is one of more than 100 injectionandwithdrawal wells at the storage facility socalgas worked closely with several of the world’s leading experts to stop the leak and in february 2016 doggr confirmed that the well was permanently sealed 

local community mitigation efforts 

pursuant to a stipulation and order by the la superior court socalgas provided temporary relocation support to residents in the nearby community who requested it before the well was permanently sealed at significant cost to socalgas following the permanent sealing of the well and the completion of the dph’s indoor testing of certain homes in the porter ranch community which concluded that indoor conditions did not present a longterm health risk and that it was safe for residents to return home the la superior court issued an order in may 2016 ruling that currently relocated residents be given the choice to request residence cleaning prior to returning home with such cleaning to be performed according to the dph’s proposed protocol and at socalgas’ expense socalgas completed the cleaning program and the relocation program ended in july 2016 

in may 2016 the dph also issued a directive that socalgas professionally clean in accordance with the proposed protocol prepared by the dph the homes of all residents located within the porter ranch neighborhood council boundary or who participated in the relocation program or who are located within a fivemile radius of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and have experienced symptoms from the leak the directive socalgas disputes the directive contending that it is invalid and unenforceable and has filed a petition for writ of mandate to set aside the directive 

the costs incurred to remediate and stop the leak and to mitigate local community impacts have been significant and may increase and we may be subject to potentially significant damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs to the extent any of these costs are not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of 

applicable policy limits or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

insurance and estimated costs 

excluding directors’ and officers’ liability insurance we have four kinds of insurance policies that together provide between 12 billion and 14 billion in insurance coverage depending on the nature of the claims these policies are subject to various policy limits exclusions and conditions we intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for the costs we have incurred or may incur through december 31 2017 we have received 469 million  of insurance proceeds for portions of controlofwell expenses lost gas and temporary relocation costs there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for costs related to the leak under the applicable policies and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining additional recovery or these costs exceed the amount of our coverage such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial conditions and results of operations 

at december 31 2017 socalgas estimates that its costs related to the leak are 913 million  which includes 887 million  of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance this estimate may rise significantly as more information becomes available in addition costs not included in the cost estimate of 913 million  could be material as described in “governmental investigations and civil and criminal litigation” below the actions against us seek compensatory and punitive damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs which except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions are not included in the 913 million  cost estimate as it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the amount of damages restitution or civil administrative or criminal fines penalties or other costs the recorded amounts above also do not include costs to clean additional homes pursuant to the directive future legal costs to defend litigation and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate furthermore the cost estimate of 913 million  does not include certain other costs expensed by sempra energy through december 31 2017 associated with defending shareholder derivative lawsuits there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining insurance coverage for these costs under the applicable policies and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining coverage or these costs exceed the amount of our coverage such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

governmental investigations and civil and criminal litigation 

various governmental agencies including doggr dph scaqmd carb los angeles regional water quality control board california division of occupational safety and health cpuc phmsa epa los angeles county district attorney’s office and california attorney general’s office have investigated or are investigating this incident other federal agencies eg the doe and us department of the interior investigated the incident as part of a joint interagency task force in january 2016 doggr and the cpuc selected blade energy partners to conduct under their supervision an independent analysis of the technical root cause of the leak to be funded by socalgas the timing of completion of the root cause analysis is under the control of blade energy partners doggr and the cpuc 

as of february 22 2018 373  lawsuits including over 45000   plaintiffs are pending in the la superior court against socalgas some of which have also named sempra energy 

these various lawsuits have been coordinated before a single court and will be managed under a second amended master complaint for individual actions and two consolidated class action complaints in addition a federal securities class action alleging violation of the federal securities laws has been filed against sempra energy and certain of its officers and directors in the sdca five shareholder derivative actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties have been filed against certain officers and directors of sempra energy andor socalgas four of which were joined in a consolidated shareholder derivative complaint in august 2017 three complaints have also been filed by public entities including the california attorney general and the county of los angeles these complaints seek various remedies including injunctive relief abatement of the public nuisance civil penalties payment of the cost of a longitudinal health study and money damages as well as punitive damages and attorneys’ fees additional litigation may be filed against us in the future related to the leak or our responses thereto for a more detailed description of the governmental investigations and civil and criminal lawsuits brought against us see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the costs of defending against the civil and criminal lawsuits cooperating with the various investigations and any damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs if awarded or imposed as well as the costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory proceedings 

in february 2017 the cpuc opened a proceeding pursuant to sb 380 to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region the order establishing the scope of the proceeding expressly excludes issues with respect to air quality public health causation culpability or cost responsibility regarding the leak 

section 4555 of the california public utilities code among other things directs regulated utilities to notify the cpuc if all or any portion of a major facility has been out of service for nine consecutive months although socalgas does not believe the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility or any portion of that facility was out of service for nine consecutive months socalgas provided notification out of an abundance of caution to demonstrate its commitment to regulatory compliance and transparency and because obtaining authorization to resume injection operations at the facility required more time than initially contemplated in response and as required by section 4555 the cpuc issued an oii to address whether the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility or any portion of that facility was out of service for nine consecutive months within the meaning of section 4555 and if so whether the cpuc should disallow costs for such period from socalgas’ rates under section 4555 hearings on the investigation are to be held if necessary in conjunction with socalgas’ 2019 grc proceeding if the cpuc determines that all or any portion of the facility was out of service for nine consecutive months the amount of any refund to ratepayers and the inability to earn a return on those assets could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

governmental orders and additional regulation 

in december 2015 socalgas made a commitment to mitigate the actual natural gas released from the leak and has been working on a plan to accomplish the mitigation in march 2016 the carb issued its recommended approach to achieve full mitigation of the emissions from the leak which includes recommendations that 

 in october 2016 carb issued its final report concluding that the incident resulted in total emissions from 90350 to 108950 metric tons of methane and asserting that socalgas should mitigate 109000 metric tons of methane to fully mitigate the greenhouse gas impacts of the leak although we have not agreed with carb’s estimate of methane released we continue to work with carb on developing a mitigation plan 

phmsa doggr scaqmd epa and carb have each commenced separate rulemaking proceedings to adopt further regulations covering natural gas storage facilities and injection wells doggr has issued new draft regulations for all storage fields in california and in 2016 the california legislature enacted four separate bills providing for additional regulation of natural gas storage facilities additional hearings in the california legislature as well as with various other federal and state regulatory agencies may be scheduled and additional laws orders rules and regulations may be adopted 

higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas as a result of new laws orders rules and regulations arising out of this incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates and socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any such new laws orders rules and regulations 

natural gas storage operations and reliability 

natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods including peak electric generation needs in the summer and heating needs in the winter the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility with a storage capacity of 86 bcf which represents 63 percent of socalgas’ natural gas storage inventory capacity is the largest socalgas storage facility and an important element of socalgas’ delivery system beginning october 24 2015 pursuant to orders by doggr and the governor of the state of california and sb 380 socalgas suspended injection of natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility limited withdrawals of natural gas from the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were made in 2017 to augment natural gas supplies during critical demand periods in july 2017 doggr issued an order lifting the prohibition on injection at aliso canyon subject to certain operational requirements and socalgas resumed limited injections 

if the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were to be taken out of service for any meaningful period of time it could result in an impairment of the facility significantly higher than expected operating costs andor additional capital expenditures and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized at december 31 2017 the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility 

has a net book value of 644 million  including 252 million  of construction work in progress for the project to construct a new compressor station any significant impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations for the period in which it is recorded higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas may not be recoverable in customer rates and socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected

natural gas pipeline safety assessments may not be fully or adequately recovered in rates 

pending the outcome of various regulatory agency evaluations of natural gas pipeline safety regulations practices and procedures sempra energy including the california utilities may incur incremental expense and capital investment associated with their natural gas pipeline operations and investments the california utilities filed implementation plans with the cpuc to test or replace natural gas transmission pipelines located in populated areas that either have not been pressure tested or lack sufficient documentation of a pressure test to enhance existing valve infrastructure and to retrofit pipelines to allow for the use of inline inspection technology referred to as socalgas’ and sdge’s psep 

in june 2014 the cpuc issued a final decision approving the utilities’ plan for implementing psep and established criteria to determine the amounts related to psep that may be recovered from ratepayers and the processes for recovery of such amounts including providing that such costs are subject to a reasonableness review in the future certain psep costs may be subject to recovery as determined by separate regulatory filings with the cpuc including grc filings 

various pseprelated proceedings are regularly pending before the cpuc regarding the california utilities’ reasonableness review and cost recovery requests which are often challenged by intervening parties these proceedings are described in more detail in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” in the future consumer advocacy groups may similarly challenge the california utilities’ petitions for recovery and recommend disallowances in whole or in part with respect to applications to recover psep costs 

from 2011 through 2017 socalgas and sdge have invested approximately 13 billion  and 355 million  respectively in psep with substantial additional expenditures planned as of december 31 2017 socalgas has received approval for recovery of 33 million  if the cpuc denies or significantly delays rate recovery for psep and other gas pipeline safety costs incurred by socalgas and sdge it could materially adversely affect the respective company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the california utilities are subject to increasingly stringent safety standards and the potential for significant penalties if regulators deem either sdge or socalgas to be out of compliance 

california sb 291 requires the cpuc to develop and maintain a safety enforcement program that includes procedures for monitoring data tracking and analysis and investigations and delegates citation authority to cpuc staff personnel under the direction of the cpuc executive director in exercising this citation authority the cpuc staff is to take into account voluntary reporting of potential violations voluntary resolution efforts undertaken prior history of violations the gravity of the violation and the degree of culpability the cpuc previously implemented both electric and gas safety enforcement programs whereby electric and gas utilities may be cited by cpuc staff for violations of the cpuc’s safety requirements or applicable federal standards 

under each enforcement program each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense the maximum penalty is 50000 per offense cpuc staff has authority to issue citations up to an administrative limit of 8 million per citation under either program and such citations may be appealed to the cpuc although citations issued under these enforcement programs do include an administrative limit penalties issued by the cpuc can exceed this limit having exceeded 15 billion in one instance for an unrelated third party 

if the cpuc or its staff determine that either of sdge’s or socalgas’ operations and practices are not in compliance with applicable safety standards and operating procedures the corrective or mitigation actions required to be in conformance if not sufficiently funded in customer rates and any penalties imposed could materially adversely affect that company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the failure by the cpuc to continue reforms of sdge’s rate structure including the implementation of a more significant fixed charge could have a material adverse effect on its business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

the current electric rate structure in california is primarily based on consumption volume which places an undue burden on residential customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers as higher electric use residential customers switch to selfgeneration or obtain local offthegrid sources of power such as rooftop solar the burden on the remaining higher electric use customers increases which in turn encourages more selfgeneration further increasing rate pressure on existing customers in july 2015 the cpuc adopted a decision that establishes comprehensive reform and a framework for rates that are more transparent fair and sustainable the decision provides for a minimum monthly bill fewer rate tiers and a gradual reduction in the differences between the tiered rates directs the utilities to pursue expanded tou rates and implemented a superuser electric surcharge in 2017 for usage that exceeds average customer usage by approximately 400 percent within each climate zone the decision is being implemented over a fiveyear period from 2015 to 2020 and should result in significant relief for higheruse customers that do not exceed the superuser threshold and a rate structure that better aligns rates with actual costs to serve customers the decision also establishes a process for utilities to seek implementation of a fixed charge for residential customers in 2020 but it also sets certain conditions for the implementation of a fixed charge after the initial reforms are implemented the establishment of a fixed charge for residential customers may become more critical to help ensure rates are fair for all customers as distributed energy resources could generally reduce delivered volumes and increase fixed costs 

if the cpuc fails to continue to reform sdge’s rate structure to maintain reasonable costbased electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system such failure could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

meaningful nem reform must continue to progress to ensure that sdge is authorized to recover its costs in providing services to nem customers while minimizing the cost shift or subsidy being borne by nonsolar customers 

due to current rate structures and state policies customers who selfgenerate their own electricity using eligible renewable resources primarily solar installations currently do not pay their proportionate cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system subject to certain limitations while they still receive electricity from the system when their selfgeneration is inadequate to meet their electricity needs the proportionate costs not paid by nem customers are therefore subsidized by consumers not participating in nem in addition the continuing increase of selfgenerated solar other forms of selfgeneration and other local offthegrid sources of power adversely impacts the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system 

appropriate nem reforms are necessary to help ensure that sdge is authorized to recover from nem customers the costs incurred in providing grid and energy services as well as mandated legislative and regulatory public policy programs sdge believes this design would be preferable to recovering these costs from customers not participating in nem if nem selfgenerating installations were to increase substantially between 2016 and when more significant reforms take effect in 2019 or later as described below the rate structure adopted by the cpuc could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

in july 2014 the cpuc initiated a rulemaking proceeding to develop a successor tariff to the state’s existing nem program pursuant to the provisions of ab 327 the nem program was originally established in 1995 and is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of onsite renewable generation under nem qualifying customergenerators receive a full retail rate for the energy they generate that is fed back to the utility’s power grid this occurs during times when the customer’s generation exceeds their own energy usage in addition if a nem customer generates any electricity over the annual measurement period that exceeds its annual consumption they receive compensation at a rate equal to a wholesale energy price 

in january 2016 the cpuc adopted a decision making modest changes to the nem program which require nem customers to pay some costs that would otherwise be borne by nonnem customers and moves new nem customers to tou rates together with a reduction in tiered rate differentials and the potential implementation of a fixed charge component in 2020 these changes to the nem program begin a process of reducing the cost burden on nonnem customers but sdge believes that further reforms are necessary and appropriate sdge implemented the adopted successor nem tariff in july 2016 after reaching the 617mw cap established for the prior nem program 

the electricity industry is undergoing significant change including increased deployment of distributed energy resources technological advancements and political and regulatory developments 

electric utilities in california are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources such as solar energy storage energy efficiency and demand response technologies this growth will eventually require modernization of the electric 

distribution grid to among other things accommodate twoway flows of electricity and increase the grid’s capacity to interconnect distributed energy resources the cpuc is conducting proceedings to evaluate various demonstration projects and pilots implement changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources and if feasible what if any compensation would be appropriate and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator these proceedings may result in new regulations policies andor operational changes that could materially adversely affect sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

sdge provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a longterm basis while sdge provides such procurement service for most of its customer load customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than sdge through programs such as da and cca da is currently closed but utility customers could receive procurement through cca if the customer’s local jurisdiction city offers such a program several local political jurisdictions including the city of san diego and a few other municipalities are considering the formation of a cca which if implemented could result in the departure of more than half of sdge’s bundled load for example solana beach representing less than one percent of sdge’s customer accounts has elected to begin cca service in 2018 when customers are served by another load serving entity sdge no longer serves this departing load and the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources could be borne by its remaining bundled procurement customers state law requires that customers opting to have a cca procure their electricity must absorb the cost of abovemarket electricity procurement commitments already made by sdge on their behalf though appropriate mechanisms to ensure that such costs are properly absorbed are not yet in place if mechanisms to ensure compliance with state law are not in place at the time of these potentially significant reductions in sdge’s served load remaining bundled customers of sdge could potentially experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of these cca customers prior to their departure which may not be fully recoverable in rates by sdge if legislative regulatory or legal action were taken to prevent the timely recovery of these procurement costs or if mechanisms are not in place to ensure compliance with state law the unrecovered costs could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore california legislators and stakeholder advocacy and activist groups have expressed a desire to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source by advocating increased use of renewable energy and electrification in lieu of the use of natural gas a substantial reduction or the elimination of natural gas as an energy source in california could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for future wildfires may be unobtainable prohibitively expensive or insufficient to cover losses we may incur and we may be unable to recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms 

we have experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the california utilities’ operations particularly sdge’s operations in addition the insurance that has been obtained for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses that we may incur uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates for example california courts have invoked the doctrine of inverse condemnation for wildfire damages whereby if a utility company’s facilities such as its electric distribution and transmission lines are determined to be the cause of one or more fires the utility could be liable for damages as well as attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent as a result of the strict liability standard applied to wildfires recent losses recorded by insurance companies and the risk of an increase of wildfires several catastrophic wildfires occurred in california in late 2017 for reasons such as drought conditions insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be available or may be available only at rates that are prohibitively expensive in addition even if insurance for wildfire liabilities is available it may not be available in such amounts as are necessary to cover potential losses a loss which is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially adversely affect sempra energy’s and the affected california utility’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations in addition we are unable to predict whether we would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses 

sdge incurred cpucrelated costs to resolve 2007 wildfire claims in excess of its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties in december 2012 the cpuc issued a final decision allowing sdge to maintain an authorized memorandum account enabling sdge to file applications with the cpuc requesting recovery of amounts properly recorded in the memorandum account subject to reasonableness review at a later date in september 2015 sdge filed an application with the cpuc seeking authority to recover such costs in rates over a six to tenyear period on december 6 2017 the cpuc issued a final decision denying sdge’s request to recover the 2007 wildfire costs submitted in our application if sdge is unsuccessful in its efforts to reverse the final decision through the rehearing and appeals process the 2007 wildfire costs or costs associated with any future wildfires may not be recoverable in addition pending legislation may prohibit recovery of any uninsured wildfire costs in cases of inverse condemnation where california utilities are strictly liable the failure to recover for 

the 2007 wildfires or future wildfires could materially adversely affect sempra energy’s and the affected california utility’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

we discuss these cost recovery proceedings in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” and in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility that is being decommissioned 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs formerly a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california that is in the process of being decommissioned by edison the majority owner of songs songs is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc and the cpuc on june 6 2013 edison notified sdge that it had reached a decision to permanently retire songs and seek approval from the nrc to start the decommissioning activities for the entire facility sdge and each of the other owners holds its undivided interest as a tenant in common in the property and each owner is responsible for financing its share of expenses and capital expenditures including decommissioning activities although the facility is being decommissioned sdge’s ownership interest in songs continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility which include 

 in addition sdge maintains nuclear decommissioning trusts for the purpose of providing funds to decommission songs trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities which are subject to significant market fluctuations a decline in the market value of trust assets or an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts could increase the funding requirements for these trusts which in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates furthermore cpuc approval is required in order to make withdrawals from these trusts cpuc approval for certain expenditures may be denied by the cpuc altogether if the cpuc determines that the expenditures are unreasonable finally decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the trust funds rate recovery for overruns would require cpuc approval which may not occur 

interpretations of tax regulations could impact access to nuclear decommissioning trust funds for reimbursement of spent nuclear fuel management costs depending on how the irs or the us department of treasury ultimately interprets or alters regulations addressing the taxation of a qualified nuclear decommissioning trust sdge may be restricted from withdrawing amounts from its qualified decommissioning trusts to pay for spent fuel management while edison and sdge are seeking or plan to seek recovery of spent fuel management costs in litigation against or in settlements with the doe in december 2016 the irs and the us department of treasury issued proposed regulations that clarify the definition of “nuclear decommissioning costs” which are costs that may be paid for or reimbursed from a qualified fund these proposed regulations will be effective prospectively once they are finalized sdge is waiting for the adoption of or additional refinement to the proposed regulations before determining whether the proposed regulations will allow sdge to access the ndt funds for reimbursement or payment of the spent fuel management costs that were or will be incurred in 2016 and subsequent years until the doe litigation is resolved andor irs regulations regarding spent fuel management costs are confirmed to apply sdge expects to continue to pay for its share of such spent fuel management costs if sdge is unable to obtain timely access to the trusts for these costs sdge’s cash flows could be negatively impacted 

in november 2014 the cpuc approved the amended settlement agreement that resolved the investigation into the steam generator replacement project that ultimately led to the shutdown of songs various petitions have since been filed to reopen the settlement in december 2016 the cpuc issued a ruling directing parties to the songs oii to determine whether an agreement could be reached to modify the amended settlement agreement previously approved by the cpuc to resolve allegations that unreported ex parte  communications between edison and the cpuc resulted in an unfair advantage at the time the settlement agreement was negotiated in october 2017 the cpuc issued a ruling with respect to the proceeding establishing a process to bring the proceeding to a conclusion and in november 2017 the cpuc held a status conference in january 2018 the cpuc issued a ruling that further clarified the scope of future evidentiary hearings this ruling establishes a status conference and includes a preliminary schedule for additional testimony hearings and briefings on january 30 2018 sdge edison turn 

ora and other intervenors entered into a revised settlement agreement on the same date the parties filed a joint motion for adoption of the settlement agreement with the cpuc if approved by the cpuc the revised settlement agreement will resolve all issues under consideration in the songs oii and will modify the amended settlement agreement on february 1 2018 the parties filed a motion to stay the proceedings in the oii pending the cpuc’s consideration of the revised settlement agreement on february 6 2018 the cpuc issued a ruling granting the parties’ motion to stay the proceedings and establishing a tentative procedural schedule with public participation hearings in april and july evidentiary hearings in april and may and briefing in june of 2018 

the timing of a decision from the cpuc on the joint motion for adoption of the settlement agreement is uncertain we cannot assure that the revised settlement agreement will be adopted or that the amended settlement agreement will not be modified or set aside as a result of this oii proceeding 

in connection with the revised settlement agreement and in exchange for the release of certain songsrelated claims sdge and edison entered into an agreement the utility shareholder agreement in which edison has agreed to pay sdge the amounts that sdge would have received in rates under the amended settlement agreement but will not receive upon implementation of the revised settlement agreement the utility shareholder agreement is not subject to the approval of the cpuc however it is not effective unless and until the cpuc approves the revised settlement agreement 

we provide additional detail in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the occurrence of any of these events could result in a substantial reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

risks related to our sempra south american utilities and sempra infrastructure businesses 

our businesses are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices and our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks energyrelated commodity prices impact lng liquefaction and regasification the transport and storage of natural gas and power generation from renewable and conventional sources among other businesses that we operate and invest in 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for lng terminals or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas lng electricity or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions in particular north american natural gas prices when in decline negatively impact profitability at sempra lng  midstream  

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated commodities result from multiple factors including 

 the ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

when our businesses enter into fixedprice longterm contracts to provide services or commodities they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks 

sempra mexico sempra renewables and sempra lng  midstream  generally endeavor to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure however if these contracts are at fixed prices the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures including rising operational costs costs of labor materials equipment and commodities and rising interest rates that affect financing costs we may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects providing for cost escalation providing for direct passthrough of operating costs or entering into hedges however these measures if implemented may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses andor financing costs the failure to fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled be completed within budget or operate at expected levels which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the acquisition development construction and expansion of marine and inland liquid fuels lng and lpg terminals and storage natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built 

success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 successful completion of a particular project may be materially adversely affected by among other factors 

 if we are unable to complete a development project or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or regasification liquefaction and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification liquefaction storage transmission and distribution systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the design development and construction of the cameron lng liquefaction facility involves numerous risks and uncertainties 

with respect to our project to add lng export capability at the cameron lng facility cameron lng jv is building an lng export facility consisting of three liquefaction trains designed to a total nameplate capacity of 139 mtpa of lng with an expected export capability of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf per day the estimated construction financing and other project 

costs for the facility are within the project budget adopted at the time of our final investment decision if these costs increase above the budget adopted at the time of our final investment decision we may have to contribute additional cash the majority of the investment in the liquefaction project is projectfinanced and the balance provided by the project partners any failure by the project partners to make their required investments on a timely basis could result in project delays and could materially adversely affect the development of the project in addition sempra energy has guaranteed a maximum of up to 39 billion   related to the project financing and financingrelated agreements these guarantees terminate upon cameron lng jv achieving “financial completion” of the initial threetrain liquefaction project including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests we anticipate that the guarantees will be terminated approximately nine months after all three trains achieve commercial operation if due to the joint venture’s failure to satisfy the financial completion criteria we are required to repay some or all of the 39 billion   under our guarantees any such repayments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

largescale construction projects like the design development and construction of the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility involve numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the potential for unforeseen engineering challenges substantial construction delays and increased costs cameron lng jv has a turnkey epc contract and if the contractor becomes unwilling or unable to perform according to the terms and timetable of the epc contract the project could face substantial construction delays and potentially significantly increased costs if the contractor’s delays or failures are serious enough to cause the contractor to default under the epc contract such default could result in cameron lng jv’s engagement of a substitute contractor in october 2016 the epc contractor indicated that the cameron lng project would not achieve its originally scheduled dates for completion and subsequently provided project schedules reflecting further delays to the cameron lng project the delays will result in the anticipated earnings and associated cash flows from the cameron lng jv project coming in later than originally anticipated in december 2017 cameron lng jv entered into a settlement agreement with the epc contractor to settle the contractor’s claims including those resulting from hurricane harvey that it was owed additional compensation beyond the original contract price and that it was entitled to schedule extensions under the contract based on a number of factors we continue to believe it is reasonable to expect that all three lng trains will be producing lng in 2019 though there can be no assurance that this project will not be further delayed these factors among others include the terms of the settlement agreement the project schedules received from the epc contractor cameron lng jv’s own review of the project schedules the assumptions underlying such schedules the epc contractor’s progress to date the remaining work left to be performed and the inherent risks in constructing and testing facilities such as cameron lng the inability to complete the project in accordance with the current schedule cost overruns and the other risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition credit ratings andor prospects for additional discussion of the cameron lng jv and of these risks and other risks relating to the development of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project that could adversely affect our future performance see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations –  factors influencing future performance” 

we face many challenges to develop and complete our contemplated lng export facilities 

in addition to the threetrain cameron lng liquefaction facility described above we are looking at several other lng export terminal development opportunities including a greenfield project in port arthur texas a brownfield project at our existing eca regasification facility in baja california mexico and an expansion of up to two additional liquefaction trains to the cameron liquefaction facility each of these contemplated projects faces numerous risks and must overcome significant hurdles before we can proceed with construction common to all of these projects is the risk that global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections could reduce the demand for natural gas in some sectors and cause a corresponding reduction in projected global demand for lng this could result in increased competition among those working on projects in an environment of declining lng demand such as the sempra energysponsored export initiatives such reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation which could also lead to increased competition among the lng suppliers for the declining lng demand at certain moderate levels oil prices could also make lng projects in other parts of the world still feasible and competitive with lng projects from north america thus increasing supply and the competition for the available lng demand a decline in natural gas prices outside the us which in many foreign countries are based on the price of crude oil may also materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices based on henry hub pricing 

in february 2018 sempra lng  midstream entered into a project development agreement for the joint development of the proposed port arthur lng liquefaction project with an affiliate of woodside petroleum ltd which replaced a prior agreement between the parties the project development agreement specifies how the parties will share costs and continues a framework for the parties to work jointly on permitting design engineering commercial and marketing activities associated with developing the port arthur lng liquefaction project in june 2017 sempra lng  midstream woodside petroleum ltd and korea gas corporation signed a memorandum of understanding that provides a framework for cooperation and joint discussion by the parties 

regarding key aspects of the potential development of the port arthur lng project including engineering and construction work om activities feed gas sourcing offtake of lng and the potential for korea gas corporation to purchase lng from and become an equity participant in the port arthur lng project the memorandum of understanding does not commit any party to buy or sell lng or otherwise participate in the port arthur liquefaction lng project also in may 2015 sempra lng  midstream ienova and a subsidiary of pemex entered into a project development agreement for the joint development of the proposed liquefaction project at ienova’s existing eca regasification facility in mexico the agreement specifies how the parties share costs and establishes a framework for the parties to work jointly on permitting design engineering and commercial activities associated with developing the potential liquefaction project pemex’s costsharing obligations under this agreement ended on december 31 2017 any decisions by the parties to proceed with binding agreements with respect to the formation of these potential joint ventures and the potential development of these projects will require among other things obtaining customer commitments to purchase lng completion of project assessments and achieving other necessary internal and external approvals of each party in addition all of our proposed projects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the receipt of a number of permits and approvals finding suitable partners and customers obtaining financing and incentives negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including joint venture agreements tolling capacity agreements or natural gas supply and lng sales agreements and construction contracts and reaching a final investment decision 

expansion of the cameron lng liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the joint venture project financing agreements including among others timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the project lenders under the cameron lng jv equity agreements the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all of the partners including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner one of the partners indicated to sempra energy and the other partners that it does not intend to invest additional capital in cameron lng jv with respect to the expansion as a result discussions among the partners have occurred and we are considering a variety of options to attempt to move the expansion project forward these activities have contributed to delays in developing firm pricing information and securing customer commitments and there can be no assurance that these issues will be resolved in a timely manner which could materially and adversely impact the nearterm marketing of this project and ability to secure customer commitments in light of these developments we are unable to predict whether or when we andor cameron lng jv might be able to move forward on expansion of the cameron lng liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains 

furthermore there are a number of potential new projects under construction or in the process of development by various project developers in north america in addition to ours and given the projected global demand for lng the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed with respect to our port arthur texas project this is a greenfield site and therefore it may not have the advantages often associated with brownfield sites the eca facility in mexico is subject to ongoing land disputes that could make project financing difficult as well as finding suitable partners and customers in addition while we have completed the regulatory process for an lng export facility in the us the regulatory process in mexico and the overlay of us regulations for natural gas exports to an lng export facility in mexico are not well developed there can be no assurance that such a facility could be permitted and constructed without facing significant legal challenges and uncertainties which in turn could make project financing as well as finding suitable partners and customers difficult finally eca has profitable longterm regasification contracts for 100 percent of the facility making the decision to pursue a new liquefaction facility dependent in part on whether the investment in a new liquefaction facility would over the long term be more beneficial than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts 

there can be no assurance that our contemplated lng export facilities will be completed and our inability to complete one or more of our contemplated lng export facilities could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows results of operations and prospects 

we discuss these projects further in “item 1 business” and in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could reduce or eliminate lng export opportunities and demand 

several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations to impose more stringent permitting public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations in addition to state laws some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions such as city ordinances that may restrict the performance of or prohibit the well drilling in general andor hydraulic fracturing in particular hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions but federal agencies including the epa and the bureau of land management of the us department of the interior have asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities in addition the us congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and to require 

disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process there are also certain governmental reviews that have been conducted or are underway on deep shale and other formation completion and production practices including hydraulic fracturing depending on the outcome of these studies federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate or even ban such activities certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process 

we cannot predict whether additional federal state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit if additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations natural gas prices in north america could rise which in turn could materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices based on henry hub pricing increased regulation or difficulty in permitting of hydraulic fracturing and any corresponding increase in domestic natural gas prices could materially adversely affect demand for lng exports and our ability to develop commercially viable lng export facilities beyond the three train cameron lng facility currently under construction 

increased competition and changes in trade policies could materially adversely affect us 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors many of whom have extensive and diversified developmental andor operating experience including both domestic and international and financial resources similar to or greater than ours further in recent years the natural gas pipeline storage and lng market segments have been characterized by strong and increasing competition both with respect to winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets in mexico despite the commissioning of many new energy infrastructure projects by the cfe and other governmental agencies in connection with energy reforms competition for recent pipeline projects has been intense with numerous bidders competing aggressively for these projects there can be no assurance that we will be successful in bidding for new development opportunities in the us mexico or south america in addition as noted above there are a number of potential new lng liquefaction projects under construction or in the process of being developed by various project developers in north america including our contemplated new projects and given the projected global demand for lng it is likely that most of these projects will not be completed finally as existing contracts expire at our natural gas storage assets in the gulf coast region we compete with other facilities for storage customers that could continue to support the existing carrying value of these assets and for anchor customers that could support development of new capacity these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

in addition the current us administration has indicated its intention to renegotiate trade agreements such as nafta a shift in us trade policies could materially adversely affect our lng development opportunities as well as opportunities for trade between mexico and the us 

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into extend or replace expiring longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition such longterm contracts once entered into increase our credit risk if our counterparties fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis due to bankruptcy insolvency or otherwise 

the eca lng facility has longterm capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties under these agreements customers pay capacity reservation and usage fees to receive store and regasify the customers’ lng we also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the eca lng facility were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

for the threetrain liquefaction facility currently under construction cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with engie sa and affiliates of mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd that subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the facility if the counterparties to these tolling agreements were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations to cameron lng jv on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

sempra mexico’s and sempra lng  midstream’s ability to enter into or replace existing longterm firm capacity agreements for their natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include our lng facilities a significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of lng andor 

natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

our natural gas storage assets include operational and development assets at bay gas in alabama and mississippi hub in mississippi as well as our development project la storage in louisiana la storage could be positioned to support lng export from the cameron lng jv terminal and other liquefaction projects if anticipated cash flows support further investment however changes in the us natural gas market could also lead to diminished natural gas storage values historically the value of natural gas storage services has positively correlated with the difference between the seasonal prices of natural gas among other factors in general over the past several years seasonal differences in natural gas prices have declined which have contributed to lower prices for storage services as our legacy higher rate sales contracts mature at our bay gas and mississippi hub facilities replacement sales contract rates have been and could continue to be lower than has historically been the case lower sales revenues may not be offset by cost reductions which could lead to depressed asset values future investment in bay gas mississippi hub and la storage will depend on market demand and estimates of longterm storage values our la storage development project construction permit expired in june 2017 and future development will require approval of a new construction permit by the ferc the la storage project also includes an existing 233mile pipeline header system the la storage pipeline that is not contracted market conditions could result in the need to perform recovery testing of our recorded asset values in the event such values are not recoverable we would consider the fair value of these assets relative to their carrying value to the extent the carrying value is in excess of the fair value we would record a noncash impairment charge the carrying value of our longlived natural gas storage assets at december 31 2017  was 15 billion a significant impairment charge related to our natural gas storage assets would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility and we may be unable to sell the power that sempra renewables’ and sempra mexico’s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

we provide information about these matters in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to perform we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses and the businesses that we invest in are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements or arrangements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements or arrangements should they fail to perform we may be required to enter into alternative arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such an event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition many such agreements are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses the failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects finally we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

sempra mexico’s and sempra lng  midstream’s obligations and those of their suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for “force majeure” events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

our businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits 

we are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties adjacent to and properties where our eca lng terminal in mexico is located as we discuss in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the event that we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which our eca lng terminal is located we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such terminal in addition our ability to convert the eca lng terminal into an export facility may be hindered by these disputes and they could make project financing such a facility and finding suitable partners and customers very 

difficult if we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

we rely on transportation assets and services much of which we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to 

 sempra mexico and sempra lng  midstream  also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra mexico and sempra lng  midstream  also rely on specialized ships to transport lng to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities sempra renewables sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities electricity and other services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity natural gas supplies and lng at thencurrent spot market rates which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges 

in mexico we own or have interests in natural gas distribution and transportation lpg storage and transportation facilities ethane transportation electricity generation and lng and liquid fuels marine and inland terminals in peru and chile we own or have interests in electricity generation transmission and distribution facilities and operations developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant security political legal regulatory and financial risks that vary by country including 

 our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could materially reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries we may or may 

not choose to hedge these risks and any hedges entered into may or may not be effective fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in significantly increased taxes in foreign countries and materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

we discuss litigation related to sempra mexico’s international energy projects in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

risks related to the pending acquisition of energy future holdings corp 

in this “risk factors” section we sometimes refer to sempra energy after giving effect to the assumed completion of the merger as the “combined company” 

our pending acquisition of efh including efh’s 8003 percent indirect interest in oncor is subject to various conditions including the receipt of governmental and regulatory approvals which approvals may impose onerous conditions and is subject to other risks and uncertainties that could cause the merger to be abandoned delayed or restructured andor materially adversely affect sempra energy 

sempra energy efh and oncor have not obtained all the governmental and regulatory consents approvals and rulings required to complete the merger including approval from the puct among others these and other governmental and regulatory authorities may not provide the consents approvals and rulings that are conditions to the merger or that are otherwise necessary for oncor’s operations after the merger could seek to block or challenge the merger or may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions to their approval the agreements governing the merger may require us to accept conditions from these regulators that could materially adversely impact the results of operations financial condition and prospects of the combined company if the required governmental consents approvals and rulings are not received or if they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the agreements governing the merger then neither sempra energy efh nor oncor will be obligated to complete the merger 

sempra energy and efh have determined that the merger is not subject to the premerger notification requirements of the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended the hsr act even though sempra energy and efh have determined that the merger is not subject to the hsr act governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the merger or compel divestiture of a portion of the combined company if they deem it necessary or desirable in the public interest to do so in addition in some jurisdictions a private party could initiate an action under the antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the merger before or after it is completed as a result actions taken by governmental authorities or private parties both before or after completion of the merger may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and prospects or may result in conditions or requirements that lead to abandonment delay or restructuring of the merger 

we can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the required governmental and other necessary approvals will be obtained or that any required conditions to such approvals will not materially adversely affect the results of operations financial condition or prospects of the combined company following the merger in addition it is possible that any conditions to such approvals will result in the abandonment delay or restructuring of the merger the occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and prospects whether or not the merger is completed 

completion of the merger is also subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties that among other things may alter the proposed structure and ultimate financing for the merger result in changes in or impose other limitations or conditions on the business of the combined company following the merger or have other effects that may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and prospects of the combined company if the merger is consummated or may lead to abandonment delay or restructuring of the merger 

failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and prospects and the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

other parties may offer to acquire efh or oncor on terms that are more favorable to efh than the terms of the merger agreement under the terms of the merger agreement efh or its subsidiary efih may terminate the merger agreement in certain circumstances if either of their respective boards of directors determines in its sole discretion after consultation with their independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the failure to terminate the merger agreement is inconsistent with their fiduciary duties which may allow them to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept an offer from another party if the merger is not completed we will not realize the potential benefits of the merger but will still be required to pay the substantial costs incurred in connection with pursuing the merger if the merger is not completed these and other factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects and the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

efh could incur substantial tax liabilities related to its 2016 spinoff of vistra from efh which would reduce and potentially eliminate the value of our investment in efh 

as part of its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings in 2016 efh distributed all of the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary vistra energy corp formerly tceh corp and referred to herein as vistra to certain creditors of tceh llc the spinoff and vistra became an independent publicly traded company vistra’s spinoff from efh was intended to qualify for partially taxfree treatment to efh and its stockholders under sections 368a1g 355 and 356 collectively referred to as the intended tax treatment of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended in connection with and as a condition to the spinoff efh received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain issues relating to the intended tax treatment of the spinoff as well as tax opinions from counsel to efh and vistra regarding certain aspects of the spinoff not covered by the private letter ruling 

irs private letter rulings are generally binding on the irs but the continuing validity of that ruling as well as the tax opinions received are subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions as well as the performance by efh and vistra of certain undertakings made to the irs in connection with obtaining the ruling and to counsel in connection with their opinions if any of the factual representations or assumptions in the irs private letter ruling or tax opinions which will not impact the irs position on the transactions were untrue or incomplete any such undertaking is not complied with or the facts upon which the irs private letter ruling or tax opinions were based are different from the actual facts relating to the spinoff the tax opinions andor irs private letter ruling may not be valid and as a result could be successfully challenged by the irs if it is determined that the spinoff did not qualify for the intended tax treatment efh could incur substantial tax liabilities which would materially reduce and potentially eliminate the value of our investment in efh if the merger is completed and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and prospects of the combined company and on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

due to the risks posed by the spinoff not qualifying for the intended tax treatment we have required as an express condition to closing of the merger that efh must receive a supplemental private letter ruling from the irs as well as tax opinions of counsel to sempra energy and efh that generally provide that the merger will not affect the conclusions reached in respectively the irs private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spinoff described above in november 2017 efh received the supplemental private letter ruling from the irs that provides that the merger will not affect the taxfree treatment of the spinoff similar to the irs private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spinoff the supplemental private letter ruling and any opinions issued with respect to the merger are and will be based on factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by sempra energy and efh if such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete any such undertakings are not complied with or the facts upon which the irs supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions which will not impact the irs position on the transactions are based are different from the actual facts relating to the merger the tax opinions andor supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and as a result could be successfully challenged by the irs if it is determined that the merger causes the spinoff not to qualify for the intended tax treatment efh could incur substantial tax liabilities which would materially reduce and potentially eliminate the value of our investment in efh if the merger is completed and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and prospects of the combined company and on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities should the irs invalidate the private letter ruling andor the supplemental private letter ruling efh has administrative appeal rights including the right to challenge any adverse irs position in court 

failure by oncor to successfully execute its business strategy and objectives may materially adversely affect the future results of the combined company and consequently the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

the success of the merger will depend in part on the ability of oncor to successfully execute its business strategy including delivering electricity in a safe and reliable manner minimizing service interruptions and investing in its transmission and distribution infrastructure to maintain its system serve its growing customer base with a modernized grid and support energy production these objectives are capital intensive see below under “–oncor’s operations are capital intensive and it could have liquidity needs that may require us to make additional investments in oncor” if oncor is not able to achieve these objectives is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis or otherwise fails to perform in accordance with our expectations the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all and the merger may materially adversely affect the results of operations financial condition and prospects of the combined company and consequently the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

we will continue to incur significant costs in connection with the merger and the combined company could continue to incur substantial costs as a result of the merger 

we will continue to incur significant costs in connection with the merger whether or not the merger is completed including fees paid to legal financial accounting and other advisors moreover if the merger is completed the combined company will incur 

substantial costs in connection with the merger including fees paid to legal financial accounting and other advisors many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately these expenses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations prior to completion of the merger and of the combined company following the completion of the merger 

we have issued equity securities to fund a significant portion of the merger consideration and may issue additional equity securities after the merger to reduce our indebtedness which may dilute the economic and voting interests of our current shareholders and may adversely affect the market value of our common stock and preferred stock 

under the merger agreement we are required to pay merger consideration of 945 billion payable in cash in january 2018 we completed the offering of 23364486 shares of our common stock pursuant to forward sale agreements the forward sale agreements and directly issued 3504672 shares of our common stock to the underwriters in the offering to raise proceeds to fund a portion of the merger consideration we did not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock pursuant to the forward sale agreements we expect to settle a portion of the forward sale agreements and receive cash proceeds subject to certain adjustments from the sale of shares of our common stock concurrently with or prior to the closing of the merger we expect to settle the remaining portion of the forward sale agreements after the merger if completed in multiple settlements on or prior to december 15 2019 in each case entirely by physical delivery of shares of our common stock in exchange for cash proceeds in addition in january 2018 we issued 17250000 shares of our 6 mandatory convertible preferred stock series a the “mandatory convertible preferred stock” which we expect will ultimately convert into common stock some of these equity issuances including common stock issued upon settlement of the forward sale agreements will likely occur following the merger to repay outstanding indebtedness including indebtedness we have incurred and expect to incur in connection with the merger see below under “ – we have incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the merger and will likely incur additional indebtedness related the merger as a result it may be more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts or take other actions and we may need to divert cash to fund debt service payments” although the issuance of any equity securities is subject to market conditions and other factors many of which are beyond our control and we may in fact issue fewer shares of any equity securities than anticipated the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock including shares issued upon conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock will have the effect and the issuance of additional equity securities may have the effect of diluting the economic and voting interests of our shareholders in addition the issuance of additional shares of common stock including shares issued upon conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock without a commensurate increase in our consolidated earnings would dilute and the issuance of additional equity securities could dilute our earnings per common share any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 

we have incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the merger and will likely incur additional indebtedness related to the merger as a result it may be more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts or take other actions and we may need to divert cash to fund debt service payments 

we have incurred significant additional indebtedness to finance a portion of the merger consideration and associated transaction costs in january 2018 we issued 5 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed and floating rate notes in various series that mature between 2019 and 2048 and we expect to issue up to 27 billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper although we may reduce the amount of commercial paper by borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and cash from operations to initially fund the merger consideration and associated transaction costs moreover although we intend to use equity financing after completion of the merger to repay a portion of the indebtedness incurred to finance the merger and associated transaction costs to the extent we are unable to do so the amount of indebtedness we have incurred to finance the merger and associated transaction costs will be higher than currently anticipated accordingly our debt service obligations resulting from such additional indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and prospects of the combined company 

our increased indebtedness could 



adversely affect the market price of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities” which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds increase the interest rates under our credit facilities and under any new indebtedness we may incur and reduce the trading prices of our outstanding debt securities common stock and preferred stock 

 based on the current and expected results of operations and financial condition of sempra energy and our subsidiaries and the currently anticipated financing structure for the merger we believe that our cash flow from operations together with the proceeds from borrowings issuances of equity and debt securities distributions from our equity method investments project financing and equity sales including tax equity and partnering in joint ventures will generate sufficient cash on a consolidated basis to make all of the principal and interest payments when such payments are due under sempra energy’s and our current subsidiaries’ existing credit facilities indentures and other instruments governing their outstanding indebtedness and under the indebtedness that we have incurred and that we may incur to fund the merger consideration and associated transaction costs however our expectation is subject to numerous estimates assumptions and uncertainties and there can be no assurance that we will be able to make such payments of principal and interest or repay or refinance such borrowings and obligations when due oncor and its subsidiaries will not guarantee any indebtedness of sempra energy or any of our other subsidiaries nor will any of them have any obligation to provide funds nor will we have any ability to require them to provide funds whether in the form of dividends loans or otherwise to enable sempra energy to pay dividends on its common stock or mandatory convertible preferred stock or to enable our other subsidiaries to make required debt service payments particularly in light of the ringfencing arrangements described below under “ – certain “ringfencing” measures and other existing governance mechanisms will limit our ability to influence the management and policies of oncor” as a result the merger will substantially increase our debt service obligations without any assurance that we will receive any cash from oncor or any of its subsidiaries to assist us in servicing our indebtedness paying dividends on our common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock or meeting our other cash needs 

we are committed to maintaining our credit ratings at investment grade to maintain these credit ratings we may consider it appropriate to reduce the amount of our indebtedness outstanding following the merger we may seek to reduce this indebtedness with the proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of common stock and possibly other equity securities and the settlement of sales of our common stock pursuant to our forward sale agreements cash from operations and proceeds from asset sales which may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our common stock however our ability to raise additional equity financing after completion of the merger will be subject to market conditions and a number of other risks and uncertainties including whether the results of operations of the combined company meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities after the merger on terms that we consider acceptable or at all or that we will be able to reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness after the merger should we elect to do so to a level that permits us to maintain our investment grade credit ratings 

the merger may not positively affect our results of operations and may cause a decrease in our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

we anticipate that the merger if consummated on the terms and under our financing structure will have a positive impact on our consolidated results of operations this expectation is based on current market conditions and is subject to a number of assumptions estimates projections and other uncertainties including assumptions regarding the results of operations of the combined company after the merger and the relative mix and timing of debt and equity financing necessary to ultimately fund the merger consideration and associated transaction costs this expectation also assumes that oncor will perform in accordance with our expectations and there can be no assurance that this will occur in addition we may encounter additional transaction costs and costs to manage our investment in oncor may fail to realize some or any of the benefits anticipated in the merger may be subject to currently unknown liabilities as a result of the merger or may be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates as a result there can be no assurance that the merger will positively impact our results of operations and it is possible that the merger may have an adverse effect which could be material on our results of operations financial condition and prospects or may cause our earnings per share to decrease any of which may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

certain “ringfencing” measures and other existing governance mechanisms will limit our ability to influence the management and policies of oncor 

efh and oncor implemented various “ringfencing” measures in 2007 to enhance oncor’s separateness from its owners and to mitigate the risk that oncor would be negatively impacted in the event of a bankruptcy or other adverse financial developments affecting its owners this ringfence has created both legal and financial separation between oncor holdings oncor and their subsidiaries on the one hand and efh and its affiliates and other subsidiaries on the other hand 

pursuant to the agreements related to the merger existing governance mechanisms and commitments that we made as part of our application to the puct for approval of the merger and the related stipulation with key stakeholders in the proceeding we have committed to certain “ringfencing” measures and will be subject to certain restrictions following the merger these measures governance mechanisms and restrictions include the following among other things 

 pursuant to the stipulation the current independent directors for oncor and oncor holdings will continue to serve for three years following the closing of the merger and thereafter two of these independent directors will cease to be members of their respective boards every two years each subsequent independent director will be elected for a term of four years the stipulation also provides that oncor holdings will have a nominating committee comprised entirely of independent directors who will nominate the independent director board member candidates of oncor and oncor holdings subject to approval by a majority of the remaining independent directors of oncor holdings if any independent director is removed retires or is unable to serve the stipulation provides that a replacement independent director must be chosen by the nominating committee of oncor holdings and approved by a majority of the remaining independent directors of oncor holdings under the stipulation the duties of the board members of oncor and oncor holdings will be to act in the best interests of oncor consistent with the approved ringfence and delaware law any future changes to the size composition structure or rights of the boards of oncor and oncor holdings must first be approved by the puct 

accordingly we will not control oncor or oncor holdings and will have only a limited ability to direct the management policies and operations of oncor including the deployment or disposition of oncor assets declarations of dividends strategic planning and other important corporate actions and issues the existence of these ringfencing measures may increase our costs of financing and operating efh and its subsidiaries further the oncor directors have considerable autonomy and as described in our commitments have a duty to act in the best interest of oncor consistent with the approved ringfence and delaware law which may be contrary to our best interests or be in opposition to our preferred strategic direction for oncor to the extent they 

take actions that are not in our interests the financial condition results of operations and prospects of the combined company may be materially adversely affected 

certain key personnel at oncor may choose to depart oncor prior to upon completion of or shortly after the merger and any loss of key personnel may materially adversely affect the future business and operations of oncor and the anticipated benefits of the merger 

if despite efforts to retain certain key personnel at oncor any key personnel depart or fail to continue employment as a result of the merger the loss of the services of such personnel and their experience and knowledge could adversely affect oncor’s results of operations financial condition and prospects and the successful ongoing operation of its business which could also have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and prospects of the combined company after completion of the merger 

if oncor fails to respond to challenges in the electric utility industry including changes in regulation its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and this could materially adversely affect the combined company 

because oncor is regulated by both us federal and texas state authorities it has been and will continue to be affected by legislative and regulatory developments the costs and burdens associated with complying with these regulatory requirements and adjusting oncor’s business to legislative and regulatory developments may have a material adverse effect on oncor moreover potential legislative changes regulatory changes or other market or industry changes may create greater risks to the predictability of utility earnings generally if oncor does not successfully respond to these changes it could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations financial condition and prospects which could materially adversely affect the results of operations financial condition and prospects of the combined company after the merger 

oncor’s operations are capital intensive and it could have liquidity needs that may require us to make additional investments in oncor   

oncor’s business is capital intensive and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements in the past oncor has financed a substantial portion of its cash needs with the proceeds from indebtedness in the event that oncor fails to meet its capital requirements or if its credit ratings at closing by any one of the three major rating agencies are below the ratings as of june 30 2017 we may be required to make additional investments in oncor or if oncor is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs we may elect to make additional investments in oncor which could be substantial and which would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects after the merger in that regard our commitments to the puct prohibit us from making loans to oncor as a result if oncor requires additional financing and cannot obtain it from other sources we may be required to make a capital contribution rather than a loan to oncor 

the market value of our common stock could decline if our existing shareholders sell large amounts of our common stock in anticipation of or following the merger and the market prices of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities may be affected by factors following the merger that are different from those affecting the market prices for our common stock preferred stock and debt securities prior to the merger 

following the merger shareholders of sempra energy will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business with more assets and more indebtedness current shareholders of sempra energy may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company or may wish to reduce their investment in the combined company for a number of reasons which may include loss of confidence in the ability of the combined company to execute its business strategies to comply with institutional investing guidelines to increase diversification or to track any rebalancing of stock indices in which sempra energy common stock is included if before or following the merger large amounts of sempra energy common stock are sold the market price of our common stock could decline in addition we are more exposed to rising interest rates due to our use of floating rate notes and significant increase in the amount of debt outstanding to finance the merger 

if the merger is consummated the risks associated with the combined company may affect the results of operations of the combined company and the market prices of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities following the merger differently than they affected such results of operations and market prices prior to the merger additionally the results of operations of the combined company may be affected by additional or different risks than those that currently affect the results of operations of sempra energy any of the foregoing matters could materially adversely affect the market prices of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities following the merger 

settlement provisions contained in our equity forward sale agreements subject us to certain risks 

in january 2018 we completed the offering of 23364486 shares of our common stock pursuant to forward sale agreements the forward sale agreements to raise proceeds to fund a portion of the merger consideration the counterparties to the forward sale 

agreements the forward purchasers will have the right to accelerate the forward sale agreements or in certain cases the portion thereof that they determine is affected by the relevant event and require us to physically settle the forward sale agreements on a date specified by the forward purchasers if 

 the forward purchasers’ decision to exercise their right to accelerate the forward sale agreements or in certain cases the portion thereof that they determine is affected by the relevant event and to require us to settle the forward sale agreements will be made irrespective of our interests including our need for capital in such cases we could be required to issue and deliver our common stock under the terms of the physical settlement provisions of the forward sale agreements irrespective of our capital needs which would result in dilution to our earnings per share and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock our mandatory convertible preferred stock any other equity that we may issue and our debt securities 

the forward sale agreements provide for settlement on a settlement date or dates to be specified at our discretion but which we expect to occur in multiple settlements on or prior to december 15 2019 subject to the provisions of the forward sale agreements delivery of our shares upon physical or net share settlement of the forward sale agreements will result in dilution to our earnings per share and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock mandatory convertible preferred stock and any other equity that we may issue 

we may elect subject to certain conditions cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreements if we conclude that it is in our interest to do so for example we may conclude that it is in our interest to cash settle or net share settle the forward sale agreements if the merger does not close or if we otherwise have no current use for all or a portion of the net proceeds due upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements 

if we elect to cash or net share settle all or a portion of the shares of our common stock underlying the forward sale agreements we would expect the forward purchasers or one of their affiliates to purchase the number of shares necessary based on the number of shares with respect to which we have elected cash or net share settlement in order to satisfy their obligation to return the shares of our common stock they had borrowed in connection with sales of our common stock related to our january 2018 common stock offering and if applicable in connection with net share settlement to deliver shares of our common stock to us or take into account shares of our common stock to be delivered by us as applicable the purchase of our common stock by the forward purchasers or their affiliates to unwind the forward purchasers’ hedge positions could cause the price of our common stock to increase over time thereby increasing the amount of cash or the number of shares of our common stock that we would owe to the forward purchasers upon cash settlement or net share settlement as the case may be of the forward sale agreements or decreasing the amount of cash or the number of shares of our common stock that the forward purchasers owe us upon cash settlement or net share settlement as the case may be of the forward sale agreements 

dividend requirements associated with the mandatory convertible preferred stock sempra energy issued to finance a portion of the merger consideration subject us to certain risks 

in january 2018 sempra energy issued 17250000 shares of its mandatory convertible preferred stock any future payments of cash dividends and the amount of any cash dividends we pay on the mandatory convertible preferred stock will depend on among other things our financial condition capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries and investments to distribute cash to us as well as other factors that our board of directors or an authorized committee thereof may consider relevant any failure to pay scheduled dividends on the mandatory convertible preferred stock when due would likely have a material adverse impact on the market price of the mandatory convertible preferred stock our common stock and our debt securities and would prohibit us under the terms of the mandatory convertible preferred stock from paying cash dividends on or 

repurchasing shares of our common stock subject to limited exceptions until such time as we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the mandatory convertible preferred stock 

the terms of the mandatory convertible preferred stock further provide that if dividends on any shares of the mandatory convertible preferred stock i have not been declared and paid or ii have been declared but a sum of cash or number of shares of our common stock sufficient for payment thereof has not been set aside for the benefit of the holders thereof on the applicable record date in each case for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods whether or not for consecutive dividend periods the holders of shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other classes or series of our preferred stock ranking equally with the mandatory convertible preferred stock either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation dissolution or windingup and having similar voting rights will be entitled to elect a total of two additional members of our board of directors subject to certain terms and limitations described in the certificate of determination applicable to the mandatory convertible preferred stock 

other risks 

sempra energy has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control 

sempra energy makes investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control as described above sdge holds a 20 percent ownership interest in songs which is in the process of being decommissioned by edison its majority owner sempra lng  midstream accounts for its investment in the cameron lng jv under the equity method which investment is 997 million  at december 31 2017  at december 31 2017  sempra renewables had investments totaling 813 million  in several joint ventures to operate renewable generation facilities sempra mexico has a 40percent interest in a joint venture with a subsidiary of transcanada to build own and operate the sur de texastuxpan natural gas marine pipeline in mexico a 50 percent interest in a renewables wind project in baja california  and a 50percent interest in the los ramones norte pipeline in mexico at december 31 2017  these various joint venture investments by sempra mexico totaled 624 million  sempra energy has an investment balance of 67 million  at december 31 2017  that reflects remaining distributions expected to be received from the rbs sempra commodities partnership as it is dissolved the timing and amount of distributions may be impacted by the matters we discuss related to rbs sempra commodities in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the failure to collect all or a substantial portion of our remaining investment in the rbs sempra commodities partnership could have a corresponding impact on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations

we have limited influence over these ventures and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest in addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we discuss our investments further in notes 3 4 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

market performance or changes in other assumptions could require sempra energy sdge andor socalgas to make significant unplanned contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees a decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans in addition the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors including the assumed rate of return on plan assets employee demographics discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations rates of increase in health care costs levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation an adverse change in any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

impairment of goodwill would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

as of december 31 2017 sempra energy had approximately 24 billion  of goodwill which represented approximately 48 percent  of the total assets on its consolidated balance sheet primarily related to the acquisitions of ienova pipelines and ventika in mexico chilquinta energía in chile and luz del sur in peru goodwill is not amortized but we test it for impairment annually on october 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation which could result in our recording a goodwill impairment loss we discuss our annual goodwill impairment testing process and the factors considered in such testing in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies and estimates” and in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements a goodwill impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which such charge is recorded

socalgas and sdge currently operate under a regulatory framework that 

 because changes in sdge’s and socalgas’ cost of electricity andor natural gas are substantially recovered in rates changes in these costs are offset in the changes in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings in addition to the changes in cost or market prices electric or natural gas revenues recorded during a period are impacted by customer billing cycles causing a difference between customer billings and recorded or authorized costs these differences are required to be balanced over time resulting in over and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts we discuss balancing accounts and their effects further in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the table below shows the income tax expense and etrs for sempra energy sdge and socalgas 



on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law as discussed below we recorded additional income tax expense of 870 million from the effects of the tcja in 2017 

following are the key provisions of the tcja its impact on us in 2017 and how we expect it may impact us in the future 

 our 2017 income tax expense was materially impacted by the effects of the tcja primarily relating to two provisions 

 we have not recorded deferred income tax with respect to remaining basis differences of approximately 1 billion between financial statement and income tax investment amounts in our nonus subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 because we consider them to be indefinitely reinvested it is not practicable to determine the hypothetical amount of tax that might be payable if the underlying basis differences were realized if these basis differences were realized we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determine that they are no longer indefinitely reinvested 

we recorded the effects of the tcja in 2017 using our best estimates and the information available to us through the date the financial statements were issued however our analysis is ongoing and as such the income tax effects that we have recorded are provisional 

as permitted by and in accordance with guidance issued by the sec we may adjust our provisional estimates in reporting periods throughout 2018 as we complete our analysis and as more information becomes available and these adjustments may affect earnings events and information that may result in adjustments to our provisional estimates include interpretations or rulings by the us department of the treasury or states the filing of our 2017 income tax return and the finalization of our calculation of foreign undistributed earnings 

we discuss the tcja and its impacts further in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sempra energy consolidated 

sempra energy’s income tax expense increased in 2017 due to a higher etr partially offset by lower pretax income the higher etr was primarily due to 

 sempra energy’s income tax expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher pretax income and a higher etr the higher etr was primarily due to 



 we report as part of our pretax results the income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests however we do not record income taxes for a portion of this income or loss as some of our entities with noncontrolling interests are currently treated as partnerships for income tax purposes and thus we are only liable for income taxes on the portion of the earnings that are allocated to us our pretax income however includes 100 percent of these entities as our entities with noncontrolling interests grow and as we may continue to invest in such entities the impact on our etr may become more significant 

sdge 

sdge’s income tax expense decreased in 2017 due to lower pretax income and a lower etr the pretax income in 2017 included the 351 million 208 million aftertax writeoff of wildfire regulatory asset the lower etr was primarily due to 

 sdge’s income tax expense decreased in 2016  compared to 2015  due to lower pretax income offset by a higher etr the higher etr was primarily due to

 socalgas’ income tax expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a higher etr offset by lower pretax income  the higher etr was primarily due to  

 peruvian tax legislation 

on december 10 2016 the peruvian president through a presidential decree enacted income tax law changes that became effective on january 1 2017 among other changes the new law imposes an increase in the corporate income tax rate from 28 percent in 2016 to 295 percent in 2017 and beyond as well as a decrease in the dividend withholding tax rate from 68 percent in 2016 to 5 percent in 2017 and beyond as a result of the increase to the peruvian corporate income tax rate to 295 percent we remeasured our peruvian deferred income tax balances resulting in 17 million income tax expense recorded in 2016 

equity earnings net of income tax 

equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries net of income tax which are all from sempra south american utilities’ and sempra mexico’s equity method investments were 



the decrease of 36 million  in 2017  was primarily due to 

 the decrease of 7 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily due to ienova’s acquisition of the remaining 50percent interest in ienova pipelines increasing ienova’s ownership in ienova pipelines to 100 percent offset by higher equity earnings at the eletrans joint venture

transactions with affiliates 

we provide information about our related party transactions in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations 

foreign currency translation 

our operations in south america and our natural gas distribution utility in mexico use their local currency as their functional currency the assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates at the end of the reporting period and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the reporting period the resulting noncash translation adjustments do not enter into the calculation of earnings or retained earnings but are reflected in oci and in aoci however any difference in average exchange rates used for the translation of income statement activity from year to year can cause a variance in sempra energy’s comparative results of operations changes in foreign currency translation rates between years impacted our comparative reported results as follows 



transactional impacts 

some income statement activities at our foreign operations and their joint ventures are also impacted by transactional gains and losses which we discuss below a summary of these foreign currency transactional gains and losses included in our reported results are as follows 



foreign currency exchange rate and inflation impacts on income taxes and related hedging activity   

our mexican subsidiaries have us dollardenominated cash balances receivables payables and debt monetary assets and liabilities that are affected by mexican currency exchange rate movements for mexican income tax purposes they also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are significant denominated in the mexican peso that must be translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes in addition monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes as a result fluctuations in both the currency exchange rate for the mexican peso against the us dollar and mexican inflation may expose us to fluctuations in income tax expense and equity earnings net of income tax we use foreign currency derivatives as a means to manage exposure to the currency exchange rate on our monetary assets and liabilities however we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities which makes us susceptible to volatility in income tax expense caused by exchange rate fluctuations and inflation the derivative activity impacts other income net 

the income tax expense of our south american subsidiaries is similarly impacted by inflation and currency exchange rate movements related to us dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities 

other transactions 

although the financial statements of most of our mexican subsidiaries and joint ventures energía sierra juárez and img have the us dollar as the functional currency some transactions may be denominated in the local currency such transactions are remeasured into us dollars this remeasurement creates transactional gains and losses that are included in other income net for our consolidated subsidiaries and in equity earnings net of income tax for our joint ventures including ienova pipelines until september 26 2016 and den until november 15 2017 

we utilize crosscurrency swaps that exchange our mexicanpeso denominated principal and interest payments into the us dollar and swap mexican variable interest rates for us fixed interest rates the impacts of these crosscurrency swaps are offset in oci and are reclassified from aoci into earnings through interest expense as settlements occur 

certain of our mexican pipeline projects namely los ramones i at ienova pipelines and los ramones norte within our tag joint venture generate revenue based on tariffs that are set by government agencies in mexico with contracts denominated in mexican pesos that are indexed to the us dollar adjusted annually for inflation and fluctuation in the exchange rate the 

resultant gains and losses from remeasuring the local currency amounts into us dollars and the settlement of foreign currency forwards and swaps related to these contracts are included in revenues energyrelated businesses or  equity earnings net of income tax 

our joint ventures in chile eletrans use the us dollar as the functional currency but have certain construction commitments that are denominated in clf eletrans entered into forward exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exchange risk of the clf relative to the us dollar the forward exchange contracts settle based on anticipated payments to vendors generally monthly ending in 2018 with activity recorded in equity earnings net of income tax 



capital resources and liquidity 

overview 

we expect to meet cash requirements of our operations through cash flows from operations unrestricted cash and cash equivalents borrowings under our credit facilities distributions from our equity method investments issuances of debt and equity securities project financing and other equity sales including tax equity and partnering in joint ventures we discuss the anticipated financing and cash flow impacts of our pending acquisition of efh below 

our lines of credit provide liquidity and support commercial paper as we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sempra energy sempra global and the california utilities each have fiveyear revolving credit facilities expiring in 2020 the table below shows the amount of available funds including available unused credit on these three credit facilities at december 31 2017  our foreign operations have additional general purpose credit facilities aggregating 18 billion  with 14 billion  available unused credit at december 31 2017  



 

on january 17 2018 pursuant to the terms of the sempra energy and sempra global credit facilities the amounts available under the lines of credit were increased by 250 million for sempra energy and 850 million for sempra global this additional borrowing capacity is available to us for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and is intended to provide us with additional liquidity and to support commercial paper that we may utilize from time to time to fund our strategic and growth initiatives 

sempra energy consolidated 

we believe that these available funds combined with cash flows from operations distributions from our equity method investments issuances of debt and equity securities project financing and other equity sales including tax equity and partnering in joint ventures will be adequate to fund our current operations including to 



 sempra energy and the california utilities currently have ready access to the longterm debt markets and are not currently constrained in their ability to borrow at reasonable rates however changing economic conditions and matters related to our pending acquisition of efh could negatively affect the availability and cost of both shortterm and longterm financing also cash flows from operations may be impacted by the timing of commencement and completion of large projects if cash flows from operations were to be significantly reduced or we were unable to borrow under acceptable terms we would likely first reduce or postpone discretionary capital expenditures not related to safety and investments in new businesses if these measures were necessary they would primarily impact our sempra infrastructure businesses before we would reduce funds necessary for the ongoing needs of our utilities we monitor our ability to finance the needs of our operating investing and financing activities in a manner consistent with our intention to maintain our investmentgrade credit ratings and capital structure  

we have significant investments in several trusts to provide for future payments of pensions and other postretirement benefits and nuclear decommissioning changes in asset values which are dependent on the activity in the equity and fixed income markets have not affected the trust funds’ abilities to make required payments however changes in asset values may along with a number of other factors such as changes to discount rates assumed rates of return mortality tables and regulations impact funding requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and sdge’s ndt at the california utilities funding requirements are generally recoverable in rates in 2017 and 2016 sale and purchase activities in our ndt increased significantly compared to prior years as a result of a change to our asset mix intended to reduce the overall risk profile of the ndt in anticipation of significant cash withdrawals over the next 10 years to fund the songs decommissioning  we discuss our employee benefit plans and sdge’s ndt including our investment allocation strategies for assets in these trusts in notes 7 and 13 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we discuss matters regarding sempra energy sdge and socalgas common stock dividends below in “dividends” 

shortterm borrowings 

our shortterm debt is primarily used to meet liquidity requirements fund shareholder dividends and temporarily finance capital expenditures and acquisitions or startups our corporate shortterm unsecured promissory notes or commercial paper were our primary sources of shortterm debt funding in 2017  at our california utilities shortterm debt is used primarily to meet working capital needs 

the following table shows selected statistics for our commercial paper borrowings for 2017  



 pending acquisition of energy future holdings corp 

on august 21 2017 sempra energy entered into a merger agreement to acquire efh the indirect owner of an 8003percent interest in oncor the merger under the merger agreement we will pay merger consideration of 945 billion in cash we discuss our registered public offerings of common stock including shares offered pursuant to forward sale agreements mandatory convertible preferred stock and longterm debt completed in january 2018 below and in note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements these offerings provided total initial net proceeds of approximately 70 billion for partial funding of the merger consideration of which approximately 800 million was used to pay down commercial paper pending the closing of the merger 

on january 9 2018 we completed an offering of 23364486 shares of our common stock pursuant to forward sale agreements with  each of morgan stanley  co llc an affiliate of rbc capital markets llc and an affiliate of barclays capital inc we also sold 3504672 shares of our common stock directly to the underwriters of the offering as a result of the underwriters fully 

exercising their option to purchase shares from us solely to cover overallotments and received 368 million in net proceeds net of underwriting discounts but before deducting related expenses we did not initially receive any proceeds from the offering of our common stock offered pursuant to the forward sale agreements we expect to settle a portion of the forward sale agreements and receive proceeds from the delivery of shares of common stock concurrently with or prior to the closing of the merger we expect to settle the remaining portion of the forward sale agreements after the merger if completed in multiple settlements on or prior to december 15 2019 which is the scheduled final settlement date under the forward sale agreements at the initial forward sale price of 105074 per share we expect the net proceeds from full physical settlement of the forward sale agreements to be approximately 246 billion after deducting underwriting discounts but before deducting expenses and subject to forward price adjustments under the forward sale agreements if we elect to cash settle the forward sale agreements we would expect to receive an amount of net proceeds that is significantly lower than estimated above and we may not receive any net proceeds or may owe cash which could be a significant amount to the forward purchasers if we elect to net share settle the forward sale agreements in full we would not receive any cash proceeds from the forward purchasers and we may be required to deliver shares of our common stock to the forward purchasers 

also on january 9 2018 we sold to underwriters 17250000 shares of our 6 mandatory convertible preferred stock series a at 10000 per share or 9820 per share after deducting underwriting discounts but before deducting related expenses including 2250000 shares purchased by the underwriters as a result of the underwriters fully exercising their option to purchase shares from us solely to cover overallotments net proceeds were approximately 169 billion net of underwriting discounts but before deducting related expenses if for any reason the merger has not closed on or prior to december 1 2018 or the merger agreement is terminated at any time prior to such date then we expect to use the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes which may include in our sole discretion voluntary redemption of the mandatory convertible preferred stock debt repayment including repayment of commercial paper capital expenditures investments and possibly repurchases of our common stock at the discretion of our board of directors 

on january 12 2018 we issued 5 billion aggregate principal amount of various series of fixed and floating rate notes maturing at various times from 2019 through 2048 if we do not consummate the merger on or prior to december 1 2018 or if on or prior to such date the merger agreement is terminated we will be required to redeem all of the outstanding notes other than the 1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes maturing in 2028 at a redemption price equal to 101 percent of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any 

in addition to the net proceeds we received from the registered public offering of common stock mandatory convertible preferred stock and debt described above we expect to settle a portion of the forward sale agreements and receive proceeds from the delivery of shares of common stock concurrently with or prior to the closing of the merger to fund a portion of the merger consideration we expect to raise the remaining portion of the merger consideration through multiple issuances of up to 27 billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper which we started issuing on february 23 2018 although we may reduce this amount through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and cash from operations the commercial paper will be issued at prevailing market rates with varying maturity dates as of february 26 2018 we have issued approximately 275 million aggregate principal amount of commercial paper to fund a portion of the merger consideration with a weightedaverage maturity of 86 days and a weightedaverage interest rate of 214 percent per annum 

we intend to ultimately fund approximately 65 percent of the merger consideration and associated transaction costs with net proceeds from sales of sempra energy equity securities including proceeds from the offerings in january 2018 and from settlements of our forward sale agreements and approximately 35 percent with the net proceeds from issuances of sempra energy debt securities although we may use cash from operations and proceeds from asset sales in place of some equity financing some of the equity financing including proceeds we receive from the settlement of our forward sale agreements and from other sales of common stock may be obtained after completion of the merger and used to repay indebtedness incurred to finance a portion of the merger consideration and associated transaction costs 

we anticipate that the merger if consummated on the terms and under the financing structure currently contemplated will have a positive impact on our consolidated results of operations this expectation is based on current market conditions and is subject to a number of assumptions estimates projections and other uncertainties including assumptions regarding the results of operations of the combined company after the merger the relative mix and timing of debt and equity financing obtained to ultimately fund the merger consideration the price and interest rates of these financings and the date we close the merger this expectation also assumes that oncor will perform in accordance with our expectations and there can be no assurance that this will occur in addition we may encounter additional transaction costs and costs to manage our investment in oncor may fail to realize some or any of the benefits anticipated in the merger may be subject to currently unknown liabilities as a result of the merger or may be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates 

we provide additional discussion regarding the merger and financing risks in notes 3 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “factors influencing future performance” below and in “item 1a risk factors” we discuss the potential effects of the merger on our credit ratings in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

impacts of the tcja 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded certain effects of the tcja resulting in an increase to income tax expense of 870 million at sempra energy consolidated for the remeasurement of us federal deferred income tax assets and liabilities at the new federal income tax rate of 21 percent the onetime deemed repatriation tax on cumulative undistributed earnings of usowned foreign corporations and the related accrual of incremental us state and foreign withholding taxes on expected future repatriation of our undistributed earnings subject to deemed repatriation although there is no cash impact in 2017 these effects represent future tax payments or other cash outflow and in the case of sdge and socalgas the remeasurement of their us federal deferred income tax balances will result in cash outflow primarily for refunds to ratepayers in the future however the federal and state income taxes and withholding taxes we accrued allow us to repatriate approximately 4 billion of undistributed nonus earnings without further material tax expense expected we expect to repatriate approximately 16 billion from 2018 to 2022 as cash is generated by our businesses at the local level we currently anticipate electing to use our existing nols to offset the deemed repatriation tax however as provided under the tcja at the time of filing our tax return in 2018 should we determine that we will pay the deemed repatriation tax over a period of eight years instead of utilizing our nols our income tax expense and cash tax payments would increase 

certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies such as our funds from operationstodebt percentage could be negatively impacted as a result of certain provisions of the tcja and in particular by an anticipated decrease in income tax reimbursement payments to us from sdge and socalgas due the reduction in the us statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 percent 

certain provisions of the tcja such as 100percent expensing of capital expenditures and impacts on utilization of our nols may also influence how we fund capital expenditures the timing of capital expenditures and possible redeployment of capital through sales or monetization of assets the timing of repatriation of foreign earnings and the use of equity financing to reduce our future use of debt 

as we discuss in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and above in “changes in revenues costs and earnings – income taxes” our analysis and interpretation of the effects of the tcja and our assessment of strategies to manage the cash and earnings impacts on our businesses are ongoing 

loans tofrom affiliates 

at december 31 2017 sempra energy has provided loans to unconsolidated affiliates totaling 598 million  and has received a 35 million loan from an unconsolidated affiliate which we discuss in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

california utilities 

sdge and socalgas expect that available funds described above cash flows from operations and debt issuances will continue to be adequate to fund their respective operations 

as we discuss in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements c hanges in balancing accounts for significant costs at sdge and socalgas particularly a change between over and undercollected status may have a significant impact on cash flows as these changes generally represent the difference between when costs are incurred and when they are ultimately recovered in rates through billings to customers sdge uses the erra commodity balancing account to record the net of its actual cost incurred for electric fuel and purchased power sdge’s erra balance was undercollected by 51 million and 25 million at december 31 2017  and 2016 respectively the increase in the erra undercollected balance in 2017 has been primarily due to lower electric volume in conjunction with seasonalized electric rates the cpuc authorized an erra trigger mechanism in conjunction with california state law that allows for recovery of erra balances that exceed 5 percent of the prior year’s electric commodity revenues in august 2017 the cpuc approved sdge’s request to amortize 120 million in rates over a 14month period beginning november 2017 

sdge also uses the electric distribution fixed cost account edfca balancing account to record the difference between the authorized margin and other costs allocated to electric distribution customers sdge’s edfca balance was undercollected by 112 million and 96 million at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase resulted from lower electric volumes sold in 2017 

socalgas and sdge use the cfca balancing account to record the difference between the authorized margin and other costs allocated to core customers because mild weather experienced in 2016 and 2017 resulted in lower natural gas consumption compared to authorized levels socalgas’ cfca balance was undercollected by 164 million and 114 million at december 31 

2017 and 2016 respectively sdge’s cfca balance was undercollected by 26 million and 66 million at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

we discuss matters regarding sdge and socalgas common stock dividends below in “dividends” 

socalgas 

aliso canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak 

we provide information on the natural gas leak at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “factors influencing future performance” below and in “item 1a risk factors” the costs of defending against the related civil and criminal lawsuits and cooperating with related investigations and any damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines costs and other penalties if awarded or imposed as well as costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations also higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas as a result of new laws orders rules and regulations arising out of this incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable in customer rates which may have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations in addition if it is determined that the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility was out of service for more than nine consecutive months we may be unable to recover this investment in rates 

the costs incurred to remediate and stop the leak and to mitigate local community impacts were significant and may increase and to the extent not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

sempra south american utilities 

we expect to fund operations at chilquinta energía and luz del sur and dividends at luz del sur with available funds including credit facilities funds internally generated by those businesses issuances of corporate bonds and other external borrowings 

sempra mexico 

we expect to fund operations and dividends at ienova with available funds including credit facilities and funds internally generated by the sempra mexico businesses as well as funds from ienova’s securities issuances project financing interim funding from the parent or affiliates and partnering in joint ventures 

in 2017 2016 and 2015 ienova paid dividends of 67 million 26 million and 32 million respectively to its noncontrolling shareholders 

sempra renewables 

we expect sempra renewables to require funds for the development of and investment in electric renewable energy projects projects at sempra renewables may be financed through a combination of operating cash flow project financing funds from the parent partnering in joint ventures and other forms of equity sales including tax equity the varying costs and structure of these alternative financing sources impact the projects’ returns and their earnings profiles 

sempra lng  midstream 

we expect sempra lng  midstream to require funding for the development and expansion of its portfolio of projects which may be financed through a combination of operating cash flow funding from the parent project financing and partnering in joint ventures 

sempra lng  midstream through its interest in cameron lng jv is developing a natural gas liquefaction export facility at the cameron lng jv terminal the majority of the current threetrain liquefaction project is projectfinanced with most or all of the remainder of the capital requirements to be provided by the project partners including sempra energy through equity contributions under a joint venture agreement we expect that our remaining equity requirements to complete the project will be met by a combination of our share of cash generated from each liquefaction train as it comes on line and additional cash contributions sempra energy signed guarantees for 502 percent of cameron lng jv’s obligations under the financing agreements for a maximum amount of up to 39 billion the project financing and guarantees became effective on october 1 2014 the effective date of the joint venture formation the guarantees will terminate upon satisfaction of certain conditions 

including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests we anticipate that the guarantees will be terminated approximately nine months after all three trains achieve commercial operation 

we discuss cameron lng jv and the joint venture financing further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements below in “factors influencing future performance” and  in “item 1a risk factors”

dividend restrictions 

the board of directors for each of sempra energy sdge and socalgas has the discretion to determine the payment and amount of future dividends by each such entity the cpuc’s regulation of sdge’s and socalgas’ capital structures limits the amounts that are available for loans and dividends to sempra energy at december 31 2017 based on these regulations sempra energy could have received loans and dividends of approximately 469 million  from sdge and 736 million  from socalgas 

we provide additional information about dividend restrictions in “restricted net assets” in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

book value per share 

sempra energy’s book value per share on the last day of each year was 

 the decrease in 2017 was primarily the result of dividends exceeding comprehensive income partially offset by an increase in equity from sharebased compensation in 2016 the increase was attributable to comprehensive income in excess of dividends ienova’s followon equity offerings and a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation 

capitalization 

our debt to capitalization ratio calculated as total debt as a percentage of total debt and equity was as follows

factors influencing future performance 

sempra energy 

pending acquisition of energy future holdings corp 

on august 21 2017 sempra energy entered into a merger agreement to acquire efh the indirect owner of an 8003percent interest in oncor for merger consideration of 945 billion in cash oncor is a regulated electric distribution and transmission 

business that operates the largest distribution and transmission system in texas we expect the merger to close in the first half of 2018 upon consummation of the acquisition although we will consolidate efh we will account for our ownership in oncor holdings and oncor as an equity method investment we discuss this merger and related financing in notes 3 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements “capital resources and liquidity” above “item 1 business” “item 1a risk factors” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

the merger is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of the puct certain conditions such as approval from the bankruptcy court the ferc the vermont department of financial regulation and receipt of a private letter ruling from the irs have been satisfied if the required governmental consents and approvals are not received or if they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions in the agreements governing the merger the merger could be abandoned delayed or restructured the agreements governing the merger may require us to accept conditions from regulators that could materially adversely impact the results of operations financial condition and prospects of sempra energy which after giving effect to the assumed completion of our proposed acquisition of efh we refer to as the “combined company” 

oncor performance 

the success of the merger will depend in part on the ability of oncor to successfully execute its business strategy including several objectives that are capital intensive and to respond to challenges in the electric utility industry if oncor is not able to achieve these objectives is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis or otherwise fails to perform in accordance with our expectations the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all and the merger may materially adversely affect the results of operations financial condition and prospects of the combined company and consequently the market value of sempra energy common stock preferred stock and debt securities in addition if oncor fails to meet its capital requirements or if its credit ratings at closing by any one of the three major rating agencies are below the ratings as of june 30 2017 we may be required to make additional equity investments in oncor or if oncor is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs we may elect to make additional equity investments in oncor which could be substantial and which would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects after the merger in addition we have agreed that within 60 days after the merger we will contribute our proportionate share of the aggregate investment in oncor in an amount necessary for oncor to achieve a capital structure consisting of 575 percent longterm debt and 425 percent equity as calculated for regulatory purposes

we intend to ultimately finance the merger consideration of 945 billion along with the associated transaction costs with approximately 65 percent from issuances of common stock and other equity securities and approximately 35 percent from issuances of debt securities although we may use cash from operations and proceeds from asset sales in place of some equity financing on january 9 2018 we issued approximately 169 billion net of underwriting discounts but before deducting related expenses of our mandatory convertible preferred stock and 368 million of common stock net of underwriting discounts but before deducting related expenses and we completed an offering of 23364486 common shares subject to forward sale agreements which we expect to settle in whole or in part by the issuance of common stock in the future these equity issuances and contemplated equity issuances will have the effect of diluting the economic and voting interests of our shareholders and without a commensurate increase in sempra energy’s earnings would dilute our eps 

absence of control 

in accordance with the ringfencing measures existing governance mechanisms and commitments we made as part of the joint application and the stipulation we will be subject to certain restrictions following the merger the stipulation includes regulatory commitments by sempra energy most of which are similar to the regulatory commitments made by sempra energy as part of the joint application and are consistent with the ringfencing measures currently in place the ringfencing measures commitments governance mechanisms and restrictions include the following among others 



percent equity as calculated for regulatory purposes until recently oncor’s regulatory capital structure required 40 percent equity with the remaining 60 percent as debt 

 as a result of these regulatory commitments governance mechanisms and restrictions we will not control oncor holdings or oncor and we will have limited ability to direct the management policies and operations of oncor holdings and oncor including the deployment or disposition of their assets declarations of dividends strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions we will have limited representation on the oncor holdings and oncor boards of directors which will be controlled by independent directors in addition we will not be allowed to make loans to oncor or oncor holdings the existence of these ringfencing measures and other limitations may increase our costs of financing further the oncor directors have considerable autonomy and as described in our commitments have a duty to act in the best interest of oncor consistent with the approved ringfence and delaware law which may be contrary to our best interests or be in opposition to our preferred strategic direction for oncor to the extent that they take actions that are not in our interests the financial condition results of operations and prospects of the combined company may be materially adversely affected 

key personnel at oncor 

if despite efforts to retain certain key personnel at oncor any key personnel depart or fail to continue employment as a result of the merger the loss of the services of such personnel and their experience and knowledge could adversely affect oncor’s results of operations financial condition and prospects and the successful ongoing operation of its business which could also have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and prospects of the combined company 

tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 

we discuss the tcja that was signed into law on december 22 2017 in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and above in “changes in revenues costs and earnings – income taxes” and “capital resources and liquidity – impacts of the tcja” 

sdge 

sdge’s operations have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity its performance will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process environmental regulations economic conditions actions by the california legislature and the changing energy marketplace 

capital project updates 

we summarize below information regarding certain major capital projects at sdge 





sunrise powerlink project cost cap 

in august 2015 sdge filed a petition with the cpuc requesting that it revise and confirm the project cost cap for the sunrise powerlink a 500kv electric transmission line between the imperial valley and the san diego region that was energized and placed in service in june 2012 while postenergization construction activities for the project were completed in 2013 certain matters relating to outstanding claims were not resolved until the first quarter of 2015 the filing requested cpuc approval of the final expenditure report for the project and the proposed revisions to the total project cost cap as evidenced in the final report actual expenditures for the project totaled 19 billion in 2012 dollars on a net present value basis which exceeds the total project cost cap approved by the cpuc in 2008 by 44 million 

in june 2017 the cpuc dismissed sdge’s petition as moot since the sunrise powerlink transmission project has been fully constructed and found that although the cpuc may establish a cost cap for electric transmission projects the recovery of the associated costs is under ferc jurisdiction the decision also found that sdge complied with the cpuc’s quarterly reporting requirements resolving the issue of whether the adequacy of such reporting should be further investigated 

electric rate reform – california assembly bill 327 

ab 327 became law on january 1 2014 and restores the authority to establish electric residential rates for electric utility companies in california to the cpuc and removes the rate caps established in ab 1x adopted in early 2001 during california’s energy crisis and in sb 695 adopted in 2009 additionally the bill provides the cpuc the authority to adopt a monthly fixed charge for all residential customers in july 2015 the cpuc adopted a decision that established comprehensive reform and a framework for rates that are more transparent fair and sustainable the decision directed changes beginning in the summer of 2015 and provides a path for continued reforms through 2020 the changes also included fewer rate tiers and a gradual reduction in the difference between the tiered rates similar to the tier differential that existed prior to the 20002001 energy crisis for sdge the number of tiers was reduced from four to three in 2015 and was reduced to two on july 1 2016 the rate differential between the highest and lowest tiers was reduced in 2016 with further reductions intended to reach a differential of 125 times as early as 2019 the decision also directs the utilities to pursue expanded tou rates and implemented a high usage surcharge in 2017 for usage that exceeds average customer usage by approximately 400 percent the decision allows the utilities to seek a fixed charge for residential customers but sets certain conditions for its implementation which would be no sooner than 2020 in january 2017 the cpuc also approved a tou rulemaking that provides a framework and guiding principles for designing implementing and modifying the time periods in tou rates for residential customers in december 2017 sdge filed an application with the cpuc requesting approval to implement residential default tou rates effective january 1 2019 and a new residential fixed charge and a higher minimum bill effective january 1 2020 these changes if and when fully implemented should result in significant rate relief for higheruse sdge customers who do not exceed the high usage surcharge threshold and should result in a rate structure that better aligns rates with the actual cost to serve customers 

in july 2014 the cpuc initiated a rulemaking proceeding to develop a successor tariff to the state’s existing nem program pursuant to the provisions of ab 327 the nem program was originally established in 1995 and is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of onsite renewable generation under nem qualifying customergenerators receive a full retailrate for the energy they generate that is fed back to the utility’s power grid this occurs during times when the customer’s generation exceeds its own energy usage in addition if a nem customer generates any electricity over the annual 

measurement period that exceeds its annual consumption the customer receives compensation at a rate equal to a wholesale energy price 

in january 2016 the cpuc adopted modest changes to the nem program to require nem customers to pay some costs that would otherwise be borne by nonnem customers and moves new nem customers to tou rates together with a reduction in tiered rate differentials and the potential implementation of a fixed charge discussed above the nem successor tariff begins a process of reducing the cost burden on nonnem customers in 2016 sdge implemented the cpucadopted successor nem tariff after reaching the 617mw cap established for the prior nem program 

appropriate nem reform is necessary to help ensure that sdge is authorized to recover from nem customers the costs incurred in providing grid and energy services as well as mandated legislative and regulatory public policy programs sdge believes this design would be preferable to recovering these costs from customers not participating in nem if nem selfgenerating installations were to increase substantially through 2019 when more significant reforms are to take effect the rate structure adopted by the cpuc could have a material effect on sdge’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects for additional discussion see “item 1a risk factors” 

distributed energy storage – california assembly bill 2868 

ab 2868 signed into law in september 2016 requires the cpuc to direct electrical corporations including sdge to file applications for programs and investments to accelerate the widespread deployment of distributed energy storage systems ab 2868 sets a cap of 500 mw statewide divided equally among the state’s three largest electrical corporations sdge’s share being 166 mw requires that no more than 25 percent of the capacity of distributed energy storage systems be on the customer side of the utility meter and requires the cpuc to prioritize these programs and investments for the public sector and lowincome customers 

potential impacts of community choice aggregation and direct access 

sdge provides electric services including the commodity of electricity to the majority of its customers “bundled customers” sdge enters into longterm contracts to procure electricity on behalf of these bundled customers sdge’s earnings are “decoupled” from electric sales volumes one aspect of decoupling is that commodity costs for electricity are directly passed through to bundled customers see discussion in “revenues  california utilities” in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements sdge’s bundled customers have the option to purchase the commodity of electricity from alternate suppliers under defined programs including cca and da in such cases california law sb 350 prohibits remaining bundled customers from experiencing any cost increase as a result of departing customers’ choice to receive electric commodity from an alternate supplier under the existing cost allocation mechanism approved by the cpuc customers opting to have a cca procure their electricity must absorb a portion of abovemarket cost of electricity procurement commitments already made by sdge on their behalf the existing cost allocation rate mechanisms may not be sufficient to ensure that remaining bundled customers do not experience any cost increase as a result of departing customers sdge pge and edison filed a joint application with the cpuc in april 2017 to replace the existing cost allocation mechanisms to help ensure compliance with state law intended to protect bundled customers in june 2017 the cpuc initiated a rulemaking proceeding to address the existing cost allocation mechanism and dismissed the joint application without prejudice directing that the proposal be addressed in the rulemaking proceeding we expect a decision on a revised cost allocation mechanism in 2018 with implementation in 2019 

currently da in sdge’s service area is limited by state law and is approximately 17 percent of sdge’s annual demand there are no large cca providers in sdge’s service area however several local political jurisdictions including the city of san diego and a few other municipalities are considering the formation of a cca which if implemented could result in the departure of more than half of sdge’s bundled load for example solana beach representing less than 1 percent of sdge’s customer accounts has elected to begin cca service in 2018 if an effective cost allocation mechanism is not in place at the time of potentially significant reductions in sdge’s served load remaining bundled customers of sdge could bear a disproportionate share of abovemarket costs of longterm electricity procurement contracts entered into before the load departed thus bundled customers could potentially experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under longterm commitments made on behalf of the cca customers prior to their departure if legislative regulatory or legal action were taken to prevent the timely recovery of these procurement costs the unrecovered costs could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

renewable energy procurement 

sdge is subject to the rps program administered by both the cpuc and the cec which requires each california utility to procure 50 percent of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2030 

the rps program currently contains flexible compliance mechanisms that can be used to comply with or meet the rps program mandates the mechanisms provide for a cpuc waiver under certain conditions including 1 a finding of inadequate transmission 2 delays in the startup of commercial operations of renewable energy projects due to permitting or interconnection or 3 unexpected curtailment by an electric system balancing authority such as the caiso 

sdge has procured renewable energy supplies from certain suppliers whose assets are not yet online some of these assets remain contingent on electric transmission infrastructure regulatory approval project permitting and financing and the implementation of new technologies 

sdge believes it will continue to comply with the rps program requirements based on its contracting activity and if necessary application of the flexible compliance mechanisms sdge’s failure to comply with the rps program requirements could subject it to cpucimposed penalties which could materially adversely affect its business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects the cpuc has neither audited our rps program compliance nor provided us with clearance for any compliance periods 

clean energy and pollution reduction act   –   california senate bill 350 

sb 350 creates new requirements in the areas of renewable energy procurement energy efficiency resource planning and ev infrastructure the measure requires all load serving entities including sdge to file integrated resource plans that will ultimately enable the electric sector to achieve reductions in ghg emissions of 40 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030 sb 350 also clearly specifies that the utilities will file applications with the cpuc that highlight how they can help with the development and expansion of the electric charging infrastructure necessary to support the growth of the ev market expected due to the state’s alternative fuel vehicle policy initiative we expect to meet the higher rps and ghg emissions reductions requirements and are supportive of greater infrastructure development to promote ev charging 

songs 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs formerly a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california that is in the process of being decommissioned by edison the majority owner of songs in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 1a risk factors” we discuss regulatory and other matters related to songs including 

 wildfire claims cost recovery 

in september 2015 sdge filed an application with the cpuc requesting rate recovery of an estimated 379 million in costs related to the october 2007 wildfires that had been recorded as a wildfire regulatory asset as we discuss in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in response to our application seeking recovery the cpuc issued a final decision on december 6 2017 upholding the proposed decision denying sdge’s request to recover the 2007 wildfire costs submitted in our application accordingly sdge wrote off the wildfire regulatory asset resulting in a charge of 351 million 208 million aftertax in the third quarter of 2017 in writeoff of wildfire regulatory asset on the consolidated statements of operations for sempra energy and sdge sdge will continue to vigorously pursue recovery of these costs which were incurred through settling claims brought under inverse condemnation principles after the trial court denied sdge’s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ inverse condemnation claims and the appellate courts declined to review the trial court’s ruling sdge applied to the cpuc for rehearing of its decision on january 2 2018 the cpuc may grant a rehearing modify its decision or deny the request and affirm its original decision we will appeal the decision with the california courts of appeal seeking to reverse the cpuc’s decision if necessary 

with respect to the 2007 wildfires based on the trial court’s ruling that inverse condemnation claims would apply we were subject to a strict liability standard however at this point we have been denied recovery by the cpuc of our nonferc related costs insurance coverage for wildfires has significantly increased in cost and may become prohibitively expensive may be disputed by the insurers or may become unavailable and any insurance proceeds we receive for wildfire events may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to the inability to procure a sufficient amount of insurance andor the existence of limitations exclusions high deductibles failure to comply with procedural requirements and other factors which could 

materially adversely affect sdge’s and sempra energy’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

socalgas 

socalgas’ operations have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity its performance will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process environmental regulations economic conditions actions by the california legislature and the changing energy marketplace socalgas’ performance will also depend on the resolution of the legal regulatory and other matters concerning the leak at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility which we discuss below in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition to general recurring improvements to its transmission and storage systems over the next several years socalgas expects to make significant capital expenditures for pipeline safety projects pursuant to the psep we discuss these capital projects in “california utilities –  joint matters” below 

aliso canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak 

in october 2015 socalgas discovered a leak at one of its injectionandwithdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility the leak located in los angeles county which socalgas has operated as a natural gas storage facility since 1972 socalgas worked closely with several of the world’s leading experts to stop the leak in february 2016 doggr confirmed that the well was permanently sealed 

local community mitigation efforts 

pursuant to a stipulation and order by the la superior court socalgas provided temporary relocation support to residents in the nearby community who requested it before the well was permanently sealed following the permanent sealing of the well the dph conducted testing in certain homes in the porter ranch community and concluded that indoor conditions did not present a longterm health risk and that it was safe for residents to return home in may 2016 the la superior court ordered socalgas to offer to clean residents’ homes at socalgas’ expense as a condition to ending the relocation program socalgas completed the residential cleaning program and the relocation program ended in july 2016 

in may 2016 the dph also issued a directive that socalgas additionally professionally clean in accordance with the proposed protocol prepared by the dph the homes of all residents located within the porter ranch neighborhood council boundary or who participated in the relocation program or who are located within a fivemile radius of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and experienced symptoms from the leak the directive socalgas disputes the directive contending that it is invalid and unenforceable and has filed a petition for writ of mandate to set aside the directive 

the costs incurred to remediate and stop the leak and to mitigate local community impacts have been significant and may increase and we may be subject to potentially significant damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs to the extent any of these costs are not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

insurance 

excluding directors’ and officers’ liability insurance we have four kinds of insurance policies that together provide between 12 billion to 14 billion in insurance coverage depending on the nature of the claims these policies are subject to various policy limits exclusions and conditions we have been communicating with our insurance carriers and intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage through december 31 2017 we have received 469 million  of insurance proceeds for portions of controlofwell expenses lost gas and temporary relocation costs there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for costs related to the leak under the applicable policies and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining coverage or these costs exceed the amount of our coverage such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

at december 31 2017 socalgas estimates that its costs related to the leak are 913 million  which includes 887 million  of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance this estimate may rise significantly as more information becomes available in addition costs not included in the cost estimate of 913 million  could be material the actions against us seek compensatory and punitive damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs which except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions are not included in the 913 million  cost estimate as it is not 

possible at this time to predict the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the amount of damages restitution or civil administrative or criminal fines penalties or other costs the recorded amounts above also do not include costs to clean additional homes pursuant to the directive future legal costs to defend litigation and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate furthermore our cost estimate of 913 million  does not include certain other costs expensed by sempra energy through december 31 2017 associated with defending shareholder derivative lawsuits for which we would seek recovery under our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies to the extent not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we provide further detail regarding costs related to the leak 

litigation 

in connection with the leak as of february 22 2018 373  lawsuits including over 45000  plaintiffs are pending against socalgas some of which have also named sempra energy derivative and securities claims have also been filed on behalf of sempra energy andor socalgas or their shareholders against certain officers and directors of sempra energy andor socalgas in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we provide further detail on these cases as well as on complaints filed by the california attorney general acting in an independent capacity and on behalf of the people of the state of california and the carb together with the los angeles city attorney and a complaint filed by the county of los angeles on behalf of itself and the people of the state of california and on a misdemeanor criminal complaint filed by the los angeles county district attorney’s office additional litigation may be filed against us in the future related to the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility incident or our responses thereto 

the costs of defending against these civil and criminal lawsuits cooperating with these investigations and any damages restitution and civil administrative and criminal fines penalties and other costs if awarded or imposed as well as the costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

governmental investigations 

various governmental agencies have investigated or are investigating this incident 

 regulatory proceedings 

in february 2017 the cpuc opened a proceeding pursuant to sb 380 to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region the cpuc indicated it intends to conduct the proceeding in two phases with phase 1 undertaking a comprehensive effort to develop the appropriate analyses and scenarios to evaluate the impact of reducing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and phase 2 evaluating the impacts of reducing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility using the scenarios and models adopted in phase 1 in accordance with the phase 1 schedule public participation hearings began in april 2017 and workshops and additional public participation hearings are expected to occur 

section 4555 of the california public utilities code among other things directs regulated utilities to notify the cpuc if all or any portion of a major facility has been out of service for nine consecutive months although socalgas does not believe the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility or any portion of the facility was out of service for nine consecutive months socalgas provided notification out of an abundance of caution to demonstrate its commitment to regulatory compliance and transparency and because obtaining authorization to resume injection operations at the facility required more time than initially contemplated in response and as required by section 4555 the cpuc issued an oii to address whether the aliso canyon natural gas storage 

facility or any portion of the facility was out of service for nine consecutive months within the meaning of section 4555 and if so whether the cpuc should disallow the costs for such period from socalgas’ rates under section 4555 hearings on the investigation are to be held if necessary in conjunction with socalgas’ 2019 grc proceeding if the cpuc determines that all or any portion of the facility was out of service for nine consecutive months the amount of any refund to ratepayers and the inability to earn a return on those assets could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

in march 2016 the cpuc ordered socalgas to establish a memorandum account to prospectively track its authorized revenue requirement and all revenues that it receives for its normal businessasusual costs to own and operate the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and in september 2016 approved socalgas’ request to begin tracking these revenues as of march 17 2016 the cpuc will determine later whether and to what extent the authorized revenues tracked in the memorandum account may be refunded to ratepayers 

natural gas storage operations and reliability 

natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods including peak electric generation needs in the summer and heating needs in the winter the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility with a storage capacity of 86 bcf which represents 63 percent of socalgas’ natural gas storage inventory capacity is the largest socalgas storage facility and an important element of socalgas’ delivery system beginning october 25 2015 pursuant to orders by doggr and the governor of the state of california and in accordance with sb 380 socalgas suspended injection of natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in april and june of 2017 socalgas advised the caiso cec cpuc and phmsa of its concerns that the inability to inject natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility posed a risk to energy reliability in southern california limited withdrawals of natural gas from the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were made in 2017 to augment natural gas supplies during critical demand periods 

on july 19 2017 doggr issued its order to test and take temporary actions upon resuming injection aliso canyon gas storage facility  lifting the prohibition on injection at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility subject to certain requirements after injection resumed including limitations on the rate at which socalgas may withdraw natural gas from the field the cpuc additionally issued a directive to socalgas to maintain a range of working gas in the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility at a target of 236 bcf approximately 28 percent of its maximum capacity and at all times above 148 bcf later amended to require the range be maintained from zero bcf to 246 bcf of working gas in july 2017 the county of los angeles sought a temporary restraining order to block doggr’s order the superior court ruled that it lacks jurisdiction to rule on the county’s application we provide further detail regarding doggr’s order and the county of los angeles’ petition in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements having completed the steps outlined by state agencies to safely begin injections at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility as of july 31 2017 socalgas resumed limited injections 

if the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were determined to have been out of service for any meaningful period of time or permanently closed or if future cash flows were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value it could result in an impairment of the facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs andor additional capital expenditures and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized at december 31 2017 the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility has a net book value of 644 million  including 252 million  of construction work in progress for the project to construct a new compressor station any significant impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations for the period in which it is recorded higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas may not be recoverable in customer rates and could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

increased regulation 

phmsa doggr scaqmd epa and carb each commenced separate rulemaking proceedings to adopt further regulations covering natural gas storage facilities and injection wells doggr issued new draft regulations for all storage fields in california and in 2016 the california legislature enacted four separate bills providing for additional regulation of natural gas storage facilities additional hearings in the california legislature as well as with various other federal and state regulatory agencies may be scheduled and additional laws orders rules and regulations may be adopted the los angeles county board of supervisors has formed a task force to review and potentially implement new more stringent land use zoning requirements and associated regulations and enforcement protocols for oil and gas activities including natural gas storage field operations which could materially affect new or modified uses of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and other natural gas storage fields located in los angeles county 

pipes act of 2016 

in june 2016 the “protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of 2016” or the “pipes act of 2016” was enacted among other things the pipes act of 2016 

 in december 2016 phmsa published an interim final rule pursuant to the pipes act of 2016 that revises the federal pipeline safety regulations relating to underground natural gas storage facilities the interim final rule incorporates consensus safety measures for the construction maintenance riskmanagement and integritymanagement procedures for natural gas storage socalgas began the process of implementing such safety measures prior to formal adoption by phmsa and is developing the associated documents and procedures required to demonstrate compliance with the standards 

sb 380 

in may 2016 sb 380 became law and required as conditions for the resumption of natural gas injections into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility a comprehensive review of the safety of the gas storage wells at the facility and reconfiguration of all gas storage wells returning to service such that natural gas flows only through the interior metal tubing and not through the annulus between the tubing and the well casing both conditions were completed in july 2017 sb 380 further requires a cpuc proceeding which was opened in february 2017 to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region and the cpuc to consult with various governmental agencies and other entities in making its determination the order establishing the scope of the proceeding expressly excludes issues with respect to air quality public health causation culpability or cost responsibility regarding the leak 

in july 2017 doggr issued an order lifting the prohibition of the injection of natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and the cpuc’s executive director issued his concurrence with that determination subject to certain conditions the county of los angeles filed a petition for writ of mandate against doggr and its state oil and gas supervisor and the cpuc and its executive director as to which socalgas is the real party in interest alleging that doggr failed to properly conduct the comprehensive safety review required by sb 380 and failed to perform an eir pursuant to ceqa the petition seeks a writ of mandate requiring doggr and the state oil and gas supervisor to comply with sb 380 and ceqa as well as declaratory and injunctive relief against any authorization to inject natural gas 

socalgas completed the steps outlined by state agencies to safely begin injections at the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and as of july 31 2017 resumed limited injections we provide further detail regarding doggr’s order and the petition filed by the county of los angeles above under the heading “natural gas storage operations and reliability” and in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sb 888 

in september 2016 sb 888 became law which requires that a penalty assessed against a gas corporation by the cpuc with regard to a natural gas storage facility leak must at least equal the amount necessary to fully offset the impact on the climate from the ghgs emitted by the leak as determined by the carb the cpuc also must consider the extent to which the gas corporation has mitigated or is in the process of mitigating the impact on the climate from ghg emissions resulting from the leak 

additional safety enhancements 

in february 2017 socalgas notified the cpuc that it is accelerating its well integrity assessments on the natural gas storage wells at its la goleta honor rancho and playa del rey natural gas storage fields consistent with the testing prescribed by sb 380 for the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility proposed new doggr regulations and socalgas’ storage risk management plan in addition socalgas indicated its plan to reconfigure its operating natural gas storage wells such that natural gas will be injected or produced only through the interior metal tubing and not through the annulus between the tubing and the well casing to maintain a double barrier and additional layer of safety which is consistent with the direction of federal and state regulations socalgas anticipates that this work will reduce the injection and withdrawal capacity of each of these other storage fields 

depending on the volume of natural gas in storage in each field at the time natural gas is injected or withdrawn the reduction could be significant and could impact natural gas reliability and electric generation in march 2017 socalgas revised its plan as directed by the cpuc for converting all wells to tubingonly operation to maintain a prescribed withdrawal capacity through the summer on december 1 2017 socalgas sent a letter to the cpuc and doggr informing them that it is proceeding with its planned acceleration of well integrity assessments on the natural gas storage wells at its la goleta honor rancho and playa del rey natural gas storage fields as such socalgas now only operates storage wells in the tubingonly operational configuration at all of its storage fields 

higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas as a result of new laws orders rules and regulations arising out of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable in customer rates and socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any such new laws orders rules and regulations 

socalgas billing practices 

in may 2017 the cpuc issued an oii to determine whether socalgas violated any provisions of the california public utilities code general orders cpuc decisions or other requirements pertaining to billing practices from 2014 through 2016 in particular the cpuc is examining the timeliness of monthly bills extending the billing period for customers and issuing estimated bills under the oii the cpuc will also examine socalgas’ gas tariff rules and consider whether to impose penalties or other remedies we expect a decision on the oii in 2018

on october 6 2017 sdge and socalgas filed their 2019 grc applications requesting cpuc approval of test year revenue requirements for 2019 and attrition year adjustments for 2020 through 2022 as part of the 2019 grc the cpuc will review the california utilities’ interim accountability reports which compare the authorized and actual spending for certain safetyrelated activities for 2014 through 2016 in june 2017 sdge and socalgas filed their first interim accountability reports comparing authorized and actual spending in 2014 and 2015 for certain safetyrelated activities similar data for 2016 was provided with the 2019 grc filings in a second interim accountability report the stated purpose of the interim accountability reports is to provide data and metrics for key safety and risk mitigation areas that will be considered in the 2019 grc the results of the rate case may materially and adversely differ from what is contained in the grc applications 

2016 general rate case 

in june 2016 the cpuc approved a 2016 grc fd in the california utilities’ 2016 grc which was effective retroactive to january 1 2016 and established their authorized 2016 revenue requirements and the ratemaking mechanisms by which those requirements would change on an annual basis over the applicable threeyear 20162018 period the adopted revenue requirements associated with the sevenmonth period through july 2016 were recovered in rates over a 17month period beginning in august 2016 

the 2016 grc fd also resulted in certain accounting and financial impacts associated with bonus depreciation flowthrough income tax repairs deductions related to prior years and the treatment of differences between income tax incurred and income tax forecasted in the grc for 2016 through 2018 

we discuss the 2019 and 2016 grcs in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cost of capital update 

in july 2017 the cpuc issued a final decision that provides a twoyear extension for each of the utilities to file its next respective cost of capital application extending the filing date to april 2019 for a 2020 test year the final decision also reduced the roe for sdge from 1030 percent to 1020 percent and for socalgas from 1010 percent to 1005 percent for the period from january 1 2018 through december 31 2019 sdge’s and socalgas’ ratemaking capital structures will remain at current levels until modified if at all by a future cost of capital decision by the cpuc in september 2017 sdge and socalgas filed advice letters to update their cost of capital for the actual cost of longterm debt through august 2017 and forecasted cost through 2018 sdge and socalgas did not file for changes to preferred stock costs because no issuances of preferred stock through 2018 are anticipated 

in october 2017 the cpuc approved the embedded cost of debt presented in the filed advice letters resulting in a revised return on rate base for sdge from 779 percent to 755 percent and for socalgas from 802 percent to 734 percent effective january 1 2018 the automatic ccm will be in effect to adjust 2019 cost of capital if necessary unless changed by the operation of the ccm the updated costs of longterm debt and the new roes will remain in effect through december 31 2019 the cost of capital changes will also apply to capital expenditures in 2018 and 2019 for incremental projects not funded through the grc revenue requirement we provide further detail regarding cost of capital in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

incentive mechanisms 

we describe cpuc incentive mechanisms in “item 1 business – ratemaking mechanisms – incentive mechanisms” incentive awards are included in revenues when we receive required cpuc approval of the award the timing of which may not be consistent from year to year we would record penalties for results below the specified benchmarks against revenues when we believe it is probable that the cpuc would assess a penalty 

energy efficiency 

the cpuc has established incentive mechanisms that are based on the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs 



 

in march 2017 the cpuc approved the settlement agreements reached with the ora and turn regarding the incentive awards for program years 2006 through 2008 wherein the parties agreed that sdge and socalgas would offset up to a total of approximately 4 million each against future incentive awards over a threeyear period beginning in 2017 if the total incentive awards ultimately authorized for 2017 through 2019 are less than approximately 4 million for either utility the applicable utility is released from paying any remaining unapplied amount 

natural gas procurement 

the california utilities procure natural gas on behalf of their core natural gas customers the cpuc has established incentive mechanisms to allow the california utilities the opportunity to share in the savings andor costs from buying natural gas for their core customers at prices below or above monthly marketbased benchmarks socalgas procures natural gas for sdge’s core natural gas customers’ requirements socalgas’ gcim is applied on the combined portfolio basis 



in january 2018 the cpuc approved socalgas’ application for a gcim award of 4 million for natural gas procured for its core customers during the 12month period ended march 31 2017 

operational incentives 

the cpuc may establish operational incentives and associated performance benchmarks as part of a grc or cost of service proceeding in the 2016 grc fd the cpuc did not establish any operational incentives for socalgas but established an electric reliability incentive for sdge outcomes could vary from a maximum annual penalty of 8 million to a maximum annual award of 8 million 

natural gas pipeline operations safety assessments 

in 2011 the california utilities filed implementation plans with the cpuc to implement the cpuc’s directives to test or replace natural gas transmission pipelines that do not have sufficient documentation of a pressure test and to address retrofitting pipelines to allow for inline inspection tools and where appropriate automated or remote controlled shutoff valves referred to as psep in 2014 the cpuc issued a final decision approving the utilities’ analytical approach to implementing psep as embodied in an approved decision tree but did not preapprove recovery of the costs of implementing psep because initial cost estimates were too preliminary to form the basis for ratemaking instead the cpuc established a process to review the reasonableness of incurred psep costs afterthefact to determine the amounts that may be recovered from ratepayers as portions of psep have been completed actual costs have generally been higher than the preliminary estimates partially offset by changes in scope that have reduced costs implementation costs incurred through 2017 are summarized in the table below over time as we have completed an increasing number of projects socalgas and sdge achieve greater cost estimate accuracy as well as efficiencies in executing the project work cost estimates for work performed in 2017 and forward reflect the development of more detailed estimates actual cost experience as portions of the work are completed and additional refinement in scope in addition 

implementation of new regulatory requirements or clarification of existing regulatory requirements in the future could materially impact the cost forecasts 

in 2016 the cpuc issued a final decision authorizing socalgas and sdge to recover in rates 50 percent of the balances recorded in psep regulatory accounts as of january 1 each year subject to refund pending reasonableness review the decision also incorporates a forwardlooking schedule to file reasonableness review applications in 2016 and 2018 file a forecast application for preapproval of project costs incurred in 2017 and 2018 and to include psep costs not the subject of prior applications in future grcs we expect this transition from an afterthefact reasonableness review framework to preapproval of psep implementation costs based on cost forecasts to improve the certainty of recovery for psep implementation costs 

in september 2016 socalgas and sdge filed a joint application with the cpuc for review of psep project costs completed through june 30 2015 the total costs submitted for review are approximately 195 million 180 million for socalgas and 15 million for sdge socalgas and sdge expect a decision from the cpuc in 2018 although consumer advocacy groups oppose recovery of a portion of the costs submitted for review we believe these costs were prudently incurred in accordance with cpuc regulatory requirements and should be substantially approved for recovery 

in march 2017 socalgas and sdge filed an application with the cpuc requesting preapproval of the forecasted revenue requirement associated with twelve psep projects to be effective in rates on january 1 2019 the california utilities expect to incur total costs for the twelve projects of approximately 255 million 198 million in capital expenditures and 57 million in om socalgas and sdge expect a cpuc decision in the second half of 2018 

as shown in the table below socalgas and sdge have made significant pipeline safety investments under the psep program and socalgas expects to continue making significant investments as approved through various regulatory proceedings sdge’s psep program was substantially completed in 2017 with the exception of the pipeline safety  reliability project that is currently under regulatory review 





regulatory compliance and safety enforcement 

the california utilities are subject to various state and federal regulatory compliance requirements at the state level the cpuc has instituted gas and electric safety compliance programs that delegate citation authority to cpuc staff personnel under the direction of the cpuc executive director in exercising the citation authority the cpuc staff will take into account voluntary reporting of potential violations voluntary resolution efforts undertaken prior history of violations the gravity of the violation and the degree of culpability under each enforcement program each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense the maximum penalty is 50000 per offense with an administrative limit of 8 million per citation 

in october 2016 the cpuc’s cped issued a citation to socalgas for alleged violations of certain environmental mitigation measures related to the aliso canyon turbine replacement project and imposed a fine in the amount of 699500 socalgas subsequently appealed the citation and the resulting fine i n march 2017 socalgas and the cped filed a joint settlement agreement with the cpuc to resolve all matters related to the october 2016 citation as a part of the settlement agreement socalgas agreed to pay 250000 to the state’s general fund and to retain an independent firm to conduct compliance training seminars for the benefit of socalgas and cpuc personnel at a cost not to exceed 25000 the parties agreed that the settlement agreement did not constitute an admission by socalgas or denial by cped with respect to any issue of fact or law or of any violation or liability by any party in may 2017 the cpuc issued a decision approving the settlement as filed 

sempra south american utilities 

our utilities in south america have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity and their future performance will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process environmental regulations foreign currency rate fluctuations and economic conditions they are also expected to provide earnings from construction projects when completed and from other investments but will require substantial funding for these investments 

capital project updates 

we summarize below the completion of a transmission line project in 2017 at a sempra south american utilities joint venture 



we summarize below information regarding major projects in process at sempra south american utilities chilquinta energía’s projects will be financed by the joint venture partners during construction and other financing may be pursued upon project completion luz del sur intends to finance its projects through its existing debt program in peru’s capital markets 



regulated rates 

the cne in chile and the osinergmin in peru set rates for our electric distribution utilities in south america chilquinta energía and luz del sur respectively 

for chilquinta energía distribution and transmission rates for fouryear periods are reviewed separately on an alternating basis every two years the most recent review process for distribution rates was completed in november 2016 and received final approval in august 2017 the authorized distribution rates are retroactive from november 2016 and will remain in effect through october 2020 which we do not expect to have a material impact on our results chilquinta energía’s most recent review process for transmission rates was completed in september 2017 and final approval is expected in the first quarter of 2018 upon approval the transmission rates will cover the period from january 2018 through december 2019 which we do not expect to have a material impact on our results 

the components of tariffs for luz del sur are reviewed and adjusted every four years the final distribution ratesetting resolution for the 20132017 period was published in october 2013 and went into effect on november 1 2013 in december 2016 osinergmin issued a decree extending existing rates for luz del sur until november 2018 the next rate review is scheduled to be completed in 2018 covering the period from november 2018 to october 2022 

we discuss the impact of tax reform in peru in “results of operations –  changes in revenues costs and earnings –  income taxes” 

luz del sur  potential impact from tolling customers 

luz del sur is an electric distribution utility that provides electric services including the supply of electricity to regulated and nonregulated customers nonregulated customers consist of free and tolling customers luz del sur supplies electricity to its customers from power purchased from generators under longterm takeorpay ppas a free customer has the option of purchasing electricity directly from luz del sur while paying fees to luz del sur for generation transmission primary and secondary and distribution services or choosing to become a tolling customer a tolling customer purchases electricity from alternative suppliers and pays only a tolling fee to luz del sur for secondary transmission and distribution to the extent customers choose to become tolling customers luz del sur may be exposed to stranded costs related to capacity charges under its longterm takeorpay ppas we discuss luz del sur’s customers and demand in “item 1 business”   

sempra mexico 

capital projects updates 

the table below summarizes certain projects that were completed in 2017 at sempra mexico 



 

we summarize major projects in process at sempra mexico below 



energía costa azul lng terminal 

in may 2015 sempra lng  midstream ienova and a subsidiary of pemex entered into a project development agreement for the joint development of the proposed natural gas liquefaction project at ienova’s existing regasification terminal at eca the agreement specifies how the parties share costs and establishes a framework for the parties to work jointly on permitting design engineering and commercial activities associated with exploring the development of the liquefaction project pemex’s costsharing obligations under the agreement ended on december 31 2017 eca has profitable longterm regasification contracts for 100 percent of the regasification facility’s capacity through 2028 making the decision to pursue a new liquefaction facility dependent in part on whether the investment in a new liquefaction facility would over the long term be more beneficial financially than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts 

eca has obtained the primary mexican governmental authorizations for the proposed natural gas liquefaction project including the environmental impact assessment from the national agency for safety energy and environment of mexico the social impact assessment from the mexican secretary of energy secretaría de energía and the liquefaction and power selfgeneration permits from the cre 

the development of this project is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including the receipt of a number of permits and regulatory approvals finding suitable partners and customers obtaining financing negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including joint venture agreements lng sales agreements gas supply agreements and construction contracts reaching a final investment decision and other factors associated with this potential investment for a discussion of these risks see “item 1a risk factors” 

ienova pipelines and den 

on september 26 2016 ienova completed the acquisition of pemex’s 50percent interest in gdc now known as ienova pipelines increasing ienova’s ownership interest in ienova pipelines to 100 percent at which point ienova pipelines became a consolidated subsidiary of ienova 

on november 15 2017 ienova completed the acquisition of pemex’s 50percent interest in den increasing ienova pipelines’ ownership interest in den and tag to 100 percent and 50 percent respectively at which point den became a consolidated subsidiary of ienova den continues to account for its indirect interest in tag as an equity method investment we discuss these acquisitions further in notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

termoeléctrica de mexicali 

our tdm power plant is currently held for sale as we discuss in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other sempra mexico matters 

at december 31 2017 pemex’s longterm rating with moody’s was baa3 with a negative outlook pemex’s foreign currency longterm sp rating was bbb and its outlook was stable sp’s local currency longterm sovereign credit rating was a with a stable outlook fitch rating’s longterm issuer default rating and local currency longterm issuer default ratings were bbb although pemex is a state productive enterprise of mexico its financing obligations are not guaranteed by the mexican government as a customer with capacity contracts for transportation services on sempra mexico’s ethane and lpg pipelines if pemex were unable to meet any or all of its obligations to sempra mexico it could have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

sempra mexico continues to monitor cfe project opportunities and carefully analyze cfe bids in order to participate in those that fit its overall growth strategy there can be no assurance that ienova will be successful in bidding for new cfe projects 

the ability to successfully complete major construction projects is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties see “item 1a risk factors” 

sempra renewables 

sempra renewables’ performance is primarily a function of the solar and wind power generated by its assets power generation from these assets depends on solar and wind resource levels weather conditions and sempra renewables’ ability to maintain equipment performance 

sempra renewables’ future performance and the demand for renewable energy is impacted by various market factors most notably state mandated requirements for utilities to deliver a portion of total energy load from renewable energy sources additionally the phase out or extension of us federal income tax incentives primarily itcs and ptcs and grant programs 

could significantly impact future renewable energy resource availability and investment decisions imposition by the us government of ad valorem tariffs import quotas or other import restrictions related to solar panels could materially adversely affect sempra renewables’ business investment decisions and the demand for renewable energy in the us 

capital project updates 

we summarize below a new solar project at sempra renewables 



sempra lng  midstream 

capital project updates 

we summarize below sempra lng  midstream’s completion of the cameron interstate pipeline expansion project 



we summarize below updates regarding the cameron lng jv threetrain liquefaction joint venture project at sempra lng  midstream 



cameron lng jv threetrain liquefaction project 

construction on the current threetrain liquefaction project began in the second half of 2014 under an epc contract with a joint venture between cbi llc as assignee of cbi shaw constructors inc a wholly owned subsidiary of chicago bridge  iron company nv and chiyoda international corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of chiyoda corporation 

the total cost of the integrated cameron lng jv facility including the cost of the original facility that was contributed to the joint venture interest during construction financing costs and required reserves was estimated to be approximately 10 billion at the time of our final investment decision 

sempra lng  midstream has agreements totaling 145 bcf per day of firm natural gas transportation service to the cameron lng jv facilities on the cameron interstate pipeline with engie sa and affiliates of mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd the terms of these agreements are concurrent with the liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements 

sempra energy and the project partners executed project financing documents for senior secured debt in an aggregate principal amount up to 74 billion for the purpose of financing the cost of development and construction of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project sempra energy has entered into guarantees under which it has severally guaranteed 502 percent of cameron lng jv’s obligations under the project financing and financingrelated agreements for a maximum amount of up to 39 billion the project financing and completion guarantees became effective on october 1 2014 and the guarantees will terminate upon financial completion of the project which will occur upon satisfaction of certain conditions including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests we expect the project to achieve financial completion and the completion guarantees to be terminated approximately nine months after all three trains achieve commercial operation 

largescale construction projects like the design development and construction of the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility involve numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the potential for unforeseen engineering challenges substantial construction delays and increased costs cameron lng jv has a turnkey epc contract and if the contractor becomes unwilling or unable to perform according to the terms and timetable of the epc contract the project could face substantial construction delays and potentially significantly increased costs if the contractor’s delays or failures are serious enough to cause the contractor to default under the epc contract such default could result in cameron lng jv’s engagement of a substitute contractor in october 2016 the epc contractor indicated that the cameron lng project would not achieve its originally scheduled dates for completion and subsequently provided project schedules reflecting further delays to the cameron lng project 

during the course of construction of large projects like cameron lng contractors often assert that they are owed additional compensation schedule extensions or both cameron lng jv received information from the epc contractor claiming it was owed additional amounts beyond the contract value and entitled to schedule extensions including as a result of the impacts of hurricane harvey and other events impacting the project in december 2017 cameron lng jv entered into a settlement agreement with the epc contractor that settled claims by the epc contractor that it was owed additional compensation beyond the original contract price and that it was entitled to schedule extensions under the epc contract the settlement agreement resolves all of the epc contractor’s known and unknown claims prior to december 17 2017 and became effective in january 2018 

under the settlement agreement cameron lng jv has agreed to additional contract and bonus payments these payments are subject to the epc contractor’s achievement of certain milestones including milestones aligned to the completion of commissioning the lng trains in addition the bonus payments become payable only if the epc contractor satisfies certain additional milestones the settlement agreement waives schedulerelated liquidated damages related to the original contract schedule and reestablishes the start dates for such liquidated damages according to the settlement schedule 

based on a number of factors we continue to believe it is reasonable to expect that all three lng trains at the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility will be producing lng and start generating earnings in 2019 these factors include among others the terms of the settlement agreement the project schedules received from the epc contractor cameron lng jv’s own review of the project schedules the assumptions underlying such schedules the epc contractor’s progress to date the remaining work to be performed and the inherent risks in constructing and testing facilities such as the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility for a discussion of the cameron lng jv and of these risks and other risks relating to the development of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project that could adversely affect our future performance see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and “item 1a risk factors” 

these delays in the project and the terms of the settlement agreement increase the total estimated cost of the integrated cameron lng facility above the approximately 10 billion estimated cost however the estimated increase is expected to be within the project contingency established by the cameron lng jv at the time of the final investment decision for the project in august 2014 and is not material to sempra energy 

proposed additional cameron liquefaction expansion 

cameron lng jv has received the major permits and fta and nonfta approvals necessary to expand the current configuration of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project from the current three liquefaction trains under construction the proposed expansion project includes up to two additional liquefaction trains capable of increasing lng production capacity by approximately 9 mtpa to 10 mtpa and up to two additional full containment lng storage tanks one of which was permitted with the original threetrain project 

under the cameron lng jv financing agreements expansion of the cameron lng jv facilities beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions including among others timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from lenders under the cameron lng jv equity agreements the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all the partners including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner one of the partners indicated to sempra energy and the other partners that it does not intend to invest additional capital in cameron lng jv with respect to the expansion as a result discussions among the partners are taking place and we are considering a variety of options to attempt to move this project forward these activities have contributed to delays in developing firm pricing information and securing customer commitments and there can be no assurance that these issues will be resolved in a timely manner which could materially and adversely impact the nearterm marketing of this expansion project and cameron lng jv’s ability to secure customer commitments in light of these developments we are unable to predict when we andor cameron lng jv might be able to move forward on this expansion project 

the expansion of the cameron lng jv facilities beyond the first three trains is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including amending the cameron lng jv agreement among the partners obtaining customer commitments completing the required commercial agreements securing and maintaining all necessary permits approvals and consents obtaining financing reaching a final investment decision among the cameron lng jv partners and other factors associated with the potential investment see “item 1a risk factors” 

other lng liquefaction development 

design regulatory and commercial activities are ongoing for potential lng liquefaction developments at our port arthur texas site and at sempra mexico’s eca facility for these development projects we have met with potential customers and determined there is an interest in longterm contracts for lng supplies beginning in the 2022 to 2025 time frame 

port arthur 

in november 2016 sempra lng  midstream submitted a request to the ferc seeking authorization to site construct and operate the proposed port arthur lng natural gas liquefaction and export facility in port arthur texas 

 also in november 2016 sempra lng  midstream filed a permit application with the ferc for the texas connector pipeline project that will provide natural gas transportation service for the port arthur lng liquefaction project in february 2017 sempra 

lng  midstream initiated the ferc prefiling review process for the louisiana connector pipeline project an additional pipeline project that would also provide natural gas transportation service for the port arthur lng liquefaction project the ferc application was filed in october 2017 

development of the port arthur lng liquefaction project is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including obtaining customer commitments completing the required commercial agreements such as joint venture agreements lng sales agreements and gas supply agreements completing construction contracts securing all necessary permits and approvals obtaining financing and incentives reaching a final investment decision and other factors associated with the potential investment see “item 1a risk factors” 

energía costa azul 

we further discuss sempra lng  midstream’s participation in potential lng liquefaction development at sempra mexico’s eca facility above in “sempra mexico – energía costa azul lng terminal” 

natural gas storage assets 

the future performance of our natural gas storage assets could be impacted by ongoing changes in the us natural gas market which could lead to sustained diminished natural gas storage values 

the recorded value of our longlived natural gas storage assets at december 31 2017 is 15 billion historically the value of natural gas storage services has positively correlated with the difference between the seasonal prices of natural gas among other factors in general over the past several years seasonal differences in natural gas prices have declined which have contributed to lower prices for storage services as our legacy higher rate sales contracts mature at our bay gas and mississippi hub facilities replacement sales contract rates have been and could continue to be lower than has historically been the case lower sales revenues may not be offset by cost reductions which could lead to depressed asset values future investment in bay gas mississippi hub and la storage will be dependent on market demand and estimates of longterm storage values our la storage development project construction permit expired in june 2017 and future development will require approval of a new construction permit by the ferc the la storage project also includes an existing 233mile pipeline header system the la storage pipeline that is not currently contracted 

we perform recovery testing of our recorded asset values when market conditions indicate that such values may not be recoverable in the event such values are not recoverable we would consider the fair value of these assets relative to their carrying value to the extent the carrying value is in excess of the fair value we would record a noncash impairment charge a significant impairment charge related to our natural gas storage assets would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 

rbs sempra commodities 

in three separate transactions in 2010 and one in early 2011 we and rbs our partner in the rbs sempra commodities joint venture sold substantially all of the businesses and assets of our commoditiesmarketing partnership the investment balance of 67 million  at december 31 2017 reflects remaining distributions expected to be received from the partnership as it is dissolved the amount of distributions if any may be impacted by the matters we discuss related to rbs sempra commodities in “other litigation” in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in addition amounts may be retained by the partnership for an extended period of time to help offset unanticipated future general and administrative costs necessary to complete the dissolution of the partnership 

other sempra energy matters 

we may be further impacted by rapidly changing economic conditions these conditions may also affect our counterparties moreover the dollar may fluctuate significantly compared to some foreign currencies especially in mexico and south america where we have significant operations we discuss these matters in “impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations” above and in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

north american natural gas prices when in decline negatively affect profitability at sempra lng  midstream also a reduction in projected global demand for lng could result in increased competition among those working on projects in an environment of declining lng demand such as the sempra energysponsored export initiatives for a discussion of these risks and other risks involving changing commodity prices see “item 1a risk factors” 

litigation 

we describe legal proceedings that could adversely affect our future performance in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

management views certain accounting policies as critical because their application is the most relevant judgmental andor material to our financial position and results of operations andor because they require the use of material judgments and estimates 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss choices among alternative accounting policies that are material to our financial statements and information concerning significant estimates with the audit committee of the sempra energy board of directors 











new accounting standards 

we discuss the relevant pronouncements that have recently become effective and have had or may have a significant effect on our financial statements in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of erosion of our cash flows earnings asset values and equity due to adverse changes in market prices and interest and foreign currency rates 

risk policies 

sempra energy has policies governing its market risk management and trading activities sempra energy and the california utilities maintain separate and independent risk management committees organizations and processes for the california utilities and for all noncpuc regulated affiliates to provide oversight of these activities the committees consist of senior officers who establish policy oversee energy risk management activities and monitor the results of trading and other activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies these activities include but are not limited to daily monitoring of market positions that create credit liquidity and market risk the respective oversight organizations and committees are independent from the energy procurement departments 

along with other tools we use var and liquidity metrics to measure our exposure to market risk associated with the commodity portfolios var is an estimate of the potential loss on a position or portfolio of positions over a specified holding period based on normal market conditions and within a given statistical confidence interval a liquidity metric is intended to monitor the amount of financial resources needed for meeting potential margin calls as forward market prices move var and liquidity risk metrics are calculated independently by the respective risk management oversight organizations 

the california utilities use power and natural gas derivatives to manage natural gas and electric price risk associated with servicing load requirements the use of power and natural gas derivatives is subject to certain limitations imposed by company policy and is in compliance with risk management and trading activity plans that have been filed with and approved by the cpuc 

we discuss revenue recognition in note 1 and the additional marketrisk information regarding derivative instruments in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have exposure to changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency rates and exposure to counterparty nonperformance the following discussion of these primary marketrisk exposures as of december 31 2017 includes a discussion of how these exposures are managed 

commodity price risk 

market risk related to physical commodities is created by volatility in the prices and basis of certain commodities our various subsidiaries are exposed in varying degrees to price risk primarily to prices in the natural gas and electricity markets our policy is to manage this risk within a framework that considers the unique markets and operating and regulatory environments of each subsidiary 

sempra mexico sempra renewables and sempra lng  midstream are generally exposed to commodity price risk indirectly through their lng natural gas pipeline and storage and power generating assets and their ppas these segments may utilize commodity transactions in the course of optimizing these assets these transactions are typically priced based on market indices but may also include fixed price purchases and sales of commodities any residual exposure is monitored as described above a hypothetical 10percent unfavorable change in commodity prices would not have resulted in a material change in the fair value of our commoditybased financial derivatives for these segments at december 31 2017 and 2016 the impact of a change in energy commodity prices on our commoditybased financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled also the impact of a change in energy commodity prices on our commoditybased financial derivative instruments does not typically include the generally offsetting impact of our underlying asset positions 

the california utilities’ marketrisk exposure is limited due to cpucauthorized rate recovery of the costs of commodity purchases interstate and intrastate transportation and storage activity however socalgas may at times be exposed to market risk as a result of incentive mechanisms that reward or penalize the utility for commodity costs below or above certain benchmarks for socalgas’ gcim if commodity prices were to rise too rapidly it is likely that volumes would decline this decline would increase the perunit fixed costs which could lead to further volume declines the california utilities manage their risk within the parameters of their market risk management framework as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 the total var of the california utilities’ natural gas and electric positions was not material and the procurement activities were in compliance with the procurement plans filed with and approved by the cpuc 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily as a result of our having issued short and longterm debt subject to regulatory constraints we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to moderate our exposure to interest rate changes and to lower our overall cost of borrowing 

the table below shows the nominal amount of longterm debt 



 

interest rate risk sensitivity analysis measures interest rate risk by calculating the estimated changes in earnings that would result from a hypothetical change in market interest rates if interest rates increased or decreased 10 percent on all of sempra energy’s effective variablerate longterm debt at december 31 2017 the change in earnings over the next 12month period ended 

december 31 2018 would be 1 million these hypothetical changes in earnings are based on our longterm debt position after the effect of interest rate swaps 

we provide further information about interest rate swap transactions in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we also are subject to the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the assets of our pension plans other postretirement benefit plans and sdge’s ndt however we expect the effects of these fluctuations as they relate to the california utilities to be recovered in future rates 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk of loss that would be incurred as a result of nonperformance of our counterparties’ contractual obligations we monitor credit risk through a creditapproval process and the assignment and monitoring of credit limits we establish these credit limits based on risk and return considerations under terms customarily available in the industry 

as with market risk we have policies governing the management of credit risk that are administered by the respective credit departments for each of the california utilities and on a combined basis for all noncpuc regulated affiliates and overseen by their separate risk management committees 

this oversight includes calculating current and potential credit risk on a daily basis and monitoring actual balances in comparison to approved limits we avoid concentration of counterparties whenever possible and we believe our credit policies significantly reduce overall credit risk these policies include an evaluation of 

 we believe that we have provided adequate reserves for counterparty nonperformance 

when its development projects become operational sempra infrastructure relies significantly on the ability of suppliers to perform under longterm agreements and on our ability to enforce contract terms in the event of nonperformance also the factors that we consider in evaluating a development project include negotiating customer and supplier agreements and therefore we rely on these agreements for future performance we also may condition our decision to go forward on development projects on first obtaining these customer and supplier agreements 

as noted above in “interest rate risk” we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to moderate exposure to interest rate changes and to lower the overall cost of borrowing we would be exposed to interest rate fluctuations on the underlying debt should a counterparty to the swap fail to perform 

credit ratings 

the credit ratings of sempra energy sdge and socalgas remained at investment grade levels in 2017 at december 31 2017 sempra energy’s issuer rating with moody’s was baa1 with a negative outlook sdge’s issuer rating a1 with a stable outlook and socalgas’ longterm rating a1 with a stable outlook sempra energy’s corporate credit rating with sp was bbb with a stable outlook and sdge’s and socalgas’ corporate credit ratings were a with stable outlooks fitch ratings’ longterm issuer default rating was bbb with a stable outlook for sempra energy and a with stable outlooks for sdge and socalgas 

on october 5 and 9 2017 fitch ratings and sp respectively affirmed sempra energy’s longterm issuer credit rating following our announcement to acquire 100 percent of efh with the currently contemplated financing structure on december 20 2017 moody’s placed sempra energy’s credit ratings on negative outlook moody’s indicated that this action was triggered by our having entered into the comprehensive stipulation with the staff of the puct and other key stakeholders which moody’s described as a significant milestone in our attaining regulatory approval for the merger in addition moody’s indicated that a downgrade of sempra energy’s credit ratings over the 12 to 18 months after december 20 2017 is likely if they anticipate that sempra energy’s consolidated credit metrics will remain weak relative to sempra energy’s current credit rating beyond 2019 specifically if our consolidated ratio of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital to debt remains below 18 percent assuming successful completion of the merger for an extended period of time also unrelated to the merger the tcja could have an adverse impact on our credit ratings moody’s also indicated that a downgrade could also be considered if there is a 

further delay in the completion of the cameron lng project we provide additional discussion regarding the merger and financing risks in notes 3 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “item 1a risk factors” 

moody’s also issued a public comment on december 20 2017 regarding recent wildfires in northern california and ventura county california and how the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation under california law which is a form of strict liability may expose california ious like sdge to substantial liabilities if they are unable to recover costs from wildfires even when they have acted prudently while moody’s has not changed its assessment regarding california’s supportive regulatory environment it did determine that the december 6 2017 decision issued by the cpuc denying sdge’s request to recover approximately 379 million of pretax costs associated with the 2007 wildfires based on the cpuc’s finding that sdge did not reasonably operate the facilities involved in the wildfires is credit negative for sdge for sempra energy and for other california utilities seeking to recover costs from wildfires moody’s further indicated that it may reassess its view of the california regulatory framework if it determines that the credit supportiveness of california’s regulatory environment has weakened including as a result of the cpuc’s discretion in denying recovery of wildfire costs which would also be credit negative and could lead to a downgrade of the credit ratings of california ious including sdge or those ratings being placed on negative outlook 

in addition and unrelated to the merger on september 21 2017 sp revised its debt ratings criteria “reflecting subordination risk in corporate issue ratings” and as a result of this new methodology has indicated that it could downgrade its rating of sempra energy’s senior unsecured debt securities within the 12 months following its october 9 2017 announcement if we do not complete the merger under the financing plan currently contemplated or if the aggregate indebtedness of sempra energy’s subsidiaries continues to exceed 50 percent of sempra energy’s total consolidated debt any such downgrade or those ratings being placed on negative outlook may make it more difficult or costly for sempra energy to issue debt securities 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas have committed lines of credit to provide liquidity and to support commercial paper borrowings under these facilities bear interest at benchmark rates plus a margin that varies with market index rates and each borrower’s credit rating each facility also requires a commitment fee on available unused credit that may be impacted by each borrower’s credit rating 

under these committed lines if sempra energy were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 25 to 50 bps depending on the severity of the downgrade the commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 5 to 10 bps depending on the severity of the downgrade 

under these committed lines if sdge or socalgas were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 125 to 25 bps depending on the severity of the downgrade the commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 25 to 5 bps depending on the severity of the downgrade 

for sempra energy and sdge their credit ratings also may affect their respective credit limits related to derivative instruments as we discuss in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency and inflation rate risk 

we discuss our foreign currency and inflation exposure in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  – impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations” 

the hypothetical effect for every 10 percent appreciation in the us dollar against the currencies of mexico chile and peru in which we have operations and investments are as follows 





monetary assets and liabilities at our mexican subsidiaries that are denominated in us dollars may fluctuate significantly throughout the year these monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes based on a net monetary liability position of 31 billion including those related to our investments in joint ventures at december 31 2017 the hypothetical effect of a 10 percent increase in the mexican inflation rate is approximately 56 million lower earnings as a result of higher income tax expense for our consolidated subsidiaries as well as lower equity earnings for our joint ventures

chilquinta energía 

customers 

chilquinta energía has approximately 688000 customer meters in the region of valparaíso in central chile  with a service area covering 4400 square miles at december 31 2016  its customer meters consisted of approximately 

 in chile customers are classified as regulated and nonregulated customers based on installed capacity regulated customers are those whose installed capacity is less than 500 kilowatts kw nonregulated customers are those whose installed capacity is greater than 2000 kw customers with installed capacity between 500 kw and 2000 kw may choose to be classified as regulated or nonregulated nonregulated customers can buy power from other sources such as directly from the generator 

in 2016 chilquinta energía added approximately 16000 new customer meters at a growth rate of 23 percent chilquinta energía’s electric energy sales increased by approximately 13000 megawatt hours mwh and decreased by approximately 57000 mwh in 2016 and 2015 respectively representing an annual growth rate of 04 percent in 2016 and a decline of 19 percent in 2015 the decrease in electric energy sales in 2015 was primarily due to the transfer of certain nonregulated customers from chilquinta energía to the energyservices company tecnored sa a subsidiary of sempra south american utilities in chile 

electric resources 

the supply of electric power available to chilquinta energía comes from purchasedpower contracts currently in place with its various suppliers and its suppliers’ generating facilities this supply as of december 31 2016  was as follows 



 percent from thermal 37 percent from hydro 4 percent from wind 3 percent from solar and 3 percent from biomass sources 

power generation system 

centers for economic load dispatch centros de despacho económico de carga or cdec private organizations were in charge of coordinating the operation of the electricity system until december 31 2016 each interconnected system was subject to its own cdec chilquinta energía operates within cdecsic sistema interconectado central or central interconnected system 

effective january 1 2017 the national electric system is operated and coordinated by the national electric coordinator coordinador eléctrico nacional a new independent entity this institution is managed by a directive council consejo directivo formed by five members designated through a public tender this new entity functions as a continuation of the cdec for the central and northern interconnected system 

transmission system and access 

transmission lines in chile are either part of its main transmission system sistema de transmisión troncal or its subtransmission system sistema de subtransmisión subtransmission systems including those owned by chilquinta energía are comprised of infrastructure that is interconnected to the electricity system to supply nonregulated and regulated endusers located in the distribution service area 

we discuss transmission line projects that have been completed or are ongoing at chilquinta energía’s joint ventures in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – our business ” in the annual report 

luz del sur 

customers 

luz del sur has approximately 1078000 customer meters in the southern zone of metropolitan lima peru with a service area covering approximately 1394 square miles at december 31 2016  its customer meters consisted of approximately 

 in peru customers are classified as regulated and nonregulated customers based on capacity demand regulated customers are those whose capacity demand is less than 200 kw and their energy supply is considered public service nonregulated customers are those whose capacity demand is greater than 2500 kw customers with capacity demand between 200 kw and 2500 kw may choose to be classified as regulated or nonregulated 

in 2016 luz del sur added approximately 25000 new customer meters at a growth rate of 24 percent however luz del sur’s electric energy sales decreased by approximately 162000 mwh in 2016 compared to an increase of approximately 262000 mwh in 2015 representing a decrease in annual growth rate of 21 percent in 2016 and an increase of 36 percent in 2015 the decrease in electric energy sales in 2016 is primarily due to the migration of regulated and nonregulated customers to tolling customers who only pay a tolling fee and do not contribute to customer load 

electric resources 

the supply of electric power available to luz del sur comes from purchasedpower contracts currently in place with various suppliers as well as purchases made on an asneeded basis luz del sur also uses the supply of power generated by santa teresa its wholly owned 100mw hydroelectric power plant in peru’s cusco region 

luz del sur’s electric power supply as of december 31 2016  was as follows 



 flows available excess capacity is sold on the spot market 

power generation system 

the sistema eléctrico interconectado nacional sein is the peruvian national interconnected system the osinergmin in addition to setting tariffs as discussed above supervises the bidding processes for energy purchases between distribution companies and generators 

the committee of economic operation of the national interconnected system comité de operación económica del sistema interconectado nacional coordinates the operation and dispatch of electricity of the sein 

transmission system and access 

transmission lines in peru are divided into principal and secondary systems the principal system lines are accessible by all generators and allow the flow of energy through the national grid the secondary system lines connect principal transmission with the network of distribution companies or connect directly to certain final customers the transmission company receives tariff revenues and collects tolls based on a charge per unit of electricity 

we discuss ongoing transmission line and substation projects at luz del sur in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – our business” in the annual report 

california natural gas utility operations 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers and sdge’s core customers on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others we discuss the california utilities’ resource planning natural gas procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters below we also provide further discussion in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

customers 

at december 31 2016  socalgas had approximately 59 million customer meters consisting of approximately 

 at december 31 2016  sdge had approximately 878000 natural gas customer meters consisting of approximately 

 for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial and industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers socalgas’ wholesale customers are primarily other ious including sdge or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the california utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

socalgas purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the california utilities’ residential and smaller business customers socalgas purchases natural gas from various sources including from canada the us rockies and the southwestern regions of the us purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

to help ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company pacific gas and electric company pge and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california 

natural gas storage 

socalgas owns four natural gas storage facilities the facilities have a combined working gas capacity of 137 billion cubic feet bcf and have over 200 injection withdrawal and observation wells natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for ensuring service reliability during peak demand periods including heating needs in the winter as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility represents 63 percent of socalgas’ natural gas storage capacity socalgas discovered a natural gas leak at one of its wells at the aliso canyon facility in october 2015 and permanently sealed the well in february 2016 socalgas has not injected natural gas into aliso canyon since october 25 2015 pursuant to orders from doggr and the governor and senate bill sb 380 all discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report limited withdrawals of natural gas from aliso canyon have been made in 2017 to augment natural gas supplies during critical demand periods socalgas completed its measurement of the natural gas lost from the leak and calculated that approximately 462  bcf of natural gas was released from the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility as a result of the leak in november 2016 socalgas submitted a request to doggr seeking authorization to resume injection operations at the aliso canyon storage facility in accordance with sb 380 doggr held public meetings on february 1 and 2 2017 to receive public comment on doggr’s findings from its gas storage and well safety review and proposed pressure limits for the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility the public comment period has expired it remains for doggr to issue its safety determination after which the cpuc must concur with doggr’s determination before injections at the facility can resume we discuss the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak in “risk factors” below and in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

socalgas also provides natural gas storage services directly to its customers it uses the majority of its natural gas storage capacity to provide service to its residential and smaller business customers and offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others 

demand for natural gas 

demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products consumer preference environmental regulations legislation california’s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs other external factors such as weather the price of electricity the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas outside the state of california and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price which may in turn impact demand 

one of the larger sources for natural gas demand is electric generation natural gasfired electric generation within southern california and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants competes with electric power generated throughout the western united states natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity growth in renewable generation including rooftop solar the addition of more efficient gas technologies new energy efficiency initiatives and the extent that regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the california utilities’ respective service areas the demand may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to climate change weather conditions and other impacts and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources we provide additional information regarding the electric industry and related infrastructure projects and regulatory impacts at the california utilities in “our business” and “factors influencing future performance” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and cash provided from operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry but subject to current regulatory limitations socalgas usually injects natural gas into storage during the summer months april through october which reduces cash provided from operating activities during this period for withdrawal from storage usually during the winter months november through march which increases cash provided from operating activities when customer demand is higher 

rates and regulation 

we provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to our utilities in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

sempra infrastructure 

we provide descriptions of sempra infrastructure’s segments and information concerning their operations in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 3 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

competition 

sempra energy’s nonutility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar services they are engaged in competitive activities that require significant capital investments and skilled and experienced personnel among these competitors there may be significant variation in financial personnel and other resources compared to sempra infrastructure 

generation – renewables 

sempra renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity through its development of and investments in wind and solar power generation facilities sempra renewables also competes with other nonutility generators regulated utilities unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy service companies for sales of noncontracted renewable energy the number and type of competitors may vary based on location generation type and project size also regulatory initiatives designed to enhance energy consumption from renewable resources for regulated utility companies may increase competition from these types of institutions these utilities may have a cost of capital that differs from most independent renewable power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms this allows them to build buy and upgrade renewable generation projects without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments additionally generation from sempra renewables’ renewable energy assets is exposed to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind inclement weather and hours of sunlight 

our renewable energy competitors include among others 



because sempra mexico sells the power that it generates at its energía sierra juárez wind power generation facility into california it is also impacted by these competitive factors 

lng 

technological advances associated with shale gas and tight oil production have significantly reduced the need for north american lng import facilities and increased interest in liquefaction and export opportunities 

at current forward gas prices us gulf coast liquefaction is among the most price competitive potential lng supply in the world brownfield liquefaction is particularly price competitive resulting from many factors including 

 global lng competition may limit us lng exports as international liquefaction projects attempt to match us gulf coast lng production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility host governments for international liquefaction projects are altering fiscal and tax regimes in an effort to make projects in their jurisdictions competitive relative to us projects however sustained low oil prices may cause some of the international projects to become unfeasible due to their lng price formulas’ link to oil prices it is expected that us lng exports will increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand and thereby facilitate development of a global commodity market for natural gas and lng 

s empra lng  midstream  has a 502percent equity interest in cameron lng jv which owns a regasification facility in hackberry louisiana the joint venture began construction in the second half of 2014 on a natural gas liquefaction export facility using some of the existing regasification infrastructure the joint venture has authorization to export lng to both free trade agreement fta countries and to countries that do not have an fta with the united states 

cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with engie sa and affiliates of mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd which subscribe the full nameplate capacity of three trains at the facility in addition cameron lng jv is working on the development of up to two additional trains we discuss cameron lng jv in notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the construction of the first three trains in “our business” and “factors influencing future performance” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report our joint venture partners affiliates of engie sa mitsubishi corporation through a related company jointly established with nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha and mitsui  co ltd compete globally to market and sell lng to end users including gas and electric utilities located in lng importing countries around the world by providing liquefaction services cameron lng jv will compete indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global lng market in addition to the us these competitors are located in the middle east southeast asia africa south america australia and europe 

sempra energy is also taking steps to explore the development of additional lng export facilities at sempra lng  midstream ’s  port arthur texas property and sempra mexico’s energía costa azul regasification facility 

our lng liquefaction business’ major domestic and international competitors will include among others the following companies and their related lng affiliates 



natural gas pipelines and storage facilities 

within their respective market areas sempra lng  midstream ’s  and sempra mexico’s pipeline businesses and sempra lng  midstream ’s  storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines they compete primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets 

s empra lng  midstream ’s competitors include among others 



sempra mexico’s competitors include among others 



environmental matters 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions 

hazardous substances 

the cpuc’s hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allows california’s ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the california utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the california utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates 

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets 

air and water quality 

the electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent airquality and greenhouse gas standards such as those established by the epa the carb and scaqmd the california utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards we discuss greenhouse gas standards and credits further in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

we discuss environmental matters concerning socalgas’ aliso canyon natural gas storage facility in “risk factors” below and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance ” and note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

 item 1a risk factors 

when evaluating our company and its subsidiaries you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report these risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf we may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of the following occurs our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially negatively impacted in addition the trading prices of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning   our company set forth in the annual report including without limitation the information set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this section when we state that a risk or uncertainty may could or will have a “material adverse effect” on us or may could or will “materially adversely affect” us we mean that the risk or uncertainty may could or will as the case may be have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition prospects andor the trading prices of our securities or those of our subsidiaries 

sempra energy’s cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and the ability to utilize the cash flows from those subsidiaries 

sempra energy’s ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own expenditures common and preferred stock dividends if any and longterm debt obligations in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including without limitation as a result of legislation regulation court order contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress 

a significant portion of our worldwide cash reserves are generated by and therefore held in foreign jurisdictions some jurisdictions impose taxes on cash transferred to the united states which could reduce the cash available to us to the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in or is needed by our united states operations we may incur significant us and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds 

conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations 

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments in difficult credit market environments we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support new business activities this could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of servicing debt both of which could significantly reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings if socalgas or sdge were to have their credit ratings downgraded their cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and any downgrades of sempra energy’s credit ratings could materially adversely affect the cash flows and results of operations of sempra energy if the credit ratings of sempra energy or any of its subsidiaries were downgraded especially below investment grade financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require collateral in the form of cash a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

sempra energy has substantial investments in mexico and south america which expose us to foreign currency inflation legal tax economic geopolitical and management oversight risk 

we have significant foreign operations in mexico and south america our foreign operations pose complex management foreign currency inflation legal tax and economic risks which we may not be able to fully mitigate with our actions these risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic businesses all of our international businesses are sensitive to geopolitical uncertainties and our nonutility international businesses are sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers all of which may be driven by changes in their environments and potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions and various regional and local economic and political factors risks and uncertainties as well as us foreign policy foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on our revenue costs or cash flows from our international operations which could materially adversely affect our financial performance our currency exposures are to the mexican peruvian and chilean currencies our mexican subsidiaries have us dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities that give rise to mexican currency exchange rate movements for mexican income tax purposes they also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are significant denominated in the mexican peso that must be translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes in addition monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes our primary objective in reducing foreign currency risk is to preserve the economic value of our foreign investments and to reduce earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations we may attempt to offset material crosscurrency transactions and earnings exposure through various means including financial instruments and shortterm investments because we generally do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries we are susceptible to volatility in other comprehensive income caused by exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to our south american subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities which makes us susceptible to volatility in income tax expense we discuss our foreign currency exposure at our mexican subsidiaries in “results of operations – impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations” and “market risk – foreign currency and inflation rate risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

mexico has developed a new legal framework for the regulation of the hydrocarbons and electric power sectors based on a package of constitutional amendments approved by the mexican congress in december 2013 and implementing legislation enacted in 2014 and the issuance of new regulations thereunder however given the relatively recent creation of this legal framework it is uncertain how it will be interpreted in practice we also cannot predict the manner in which the new legal framework will affect any new business opportunities that ienova may wish to pursue the changes introduced by the new legal framework may require ienova to obtain amendments to its existing permits or secure additional permits to operate its energy facilities or to provide its services to take additional actions to secure rightsofway for its projects to perform social impact assessments and to obtain the consent of indigenous communities for the development of certain projects any or all of which may cause ienova to incur additional material costs in connection with the development of its projects 

the current us administration has previously indicated its intention to renegotiate trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement or nafta and implement us immigration policy changes the current us administration has stated that it is reviewing various options including tariffs for funding new mexico–us border security infrastructure such actions could result in changes in the mexican us and other markets in addition if this occurs the mexican government could implement retaliatory actions such as the imposition of restrictions or import fees on mexican imports of natural gas from the us or imports and exports of electricity to and from the us any of these actions by either or both governments could adversely affect imports and exports between mexico and the us and negatively impact the mexican economy and the companies with whom we conduct business in mexico which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects 

risks related to all sempra energy subsidiaries 

severe weather conditions natural disasters accidents equipment failures explosions or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by severe weather conditions natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes tsunamis and fires accidents equipment failures explosions or acts of terrorism because we are in the business of using storing transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials as well as radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure as well as the risks to the surrounding communities are substantially greater than the risks such incidents may pose to a typical business the facilities and infrastructure that we own and in which we have interests that may be subject to such incidents include but are not limited to 



such incidents could result in severe business disruptions prolonged power outages property damage injuries or loss of life significant decreases in revenues and earnings andor significant additional costs to us any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires natural gas natural gas odorant propane or ethane leaks releases of other greenhouse gases radioactive releases explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties personal injuries health impacts or fatalities or present a nuisance to impacted communities any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us in some cases we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault such as in cases where the concept of inverse condemnation applies insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost may be disputed by the insurers or may become unavailable for certain of these risks and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to the existence of limitations exclusions high deductibles failure to comply with procedural requirements and other factors which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

severe weather conditions may also impact our businesses including our international operations drought conditions in california and the western united states increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories which could place third party property and our electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy drought conditions also reduce the amount of power available from hydroelectric generation facilities in the northwest united states which could adversely impact the availability of a reliable energy supply into the california electric grid managed by the california iso if alternate supplies of electric generation are not available to replace the lower level of power available from hydroelectric generation facilities this could result in temporary power shortages in sdge’s service territory in addition severe weather conditions could result in delays andor cost increases to our capital projects 

another example of weather impacting operations is a strong el niño weather pattern in the pacific ocean which can cause severe rainstorms in coastal areas significant rainstorms and associated high winds such as those caused by a strong el niño weather pattern could damage our electric and natural gas infrastructure resulting in increased expenses including higher maintenance and repair costs and interruptions in electricity and natural gas delivery services as a result these events can have significant financial consequences including regulatory penalties and disallowances if the california utilities or our utilities in mexico or south america encounter difficulties in restoring service to their customers on a timely basis further the cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process any such events could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and tax requirements and may be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulations or requirements or in their interpretation or implementation 

in recent years the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on the federal state and local levels these changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses moreover existing regulations laws and tariffs may be revised or reinterpreted and new regulations laws and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities special tariffs may also be imposed on components used in our businesses that could increase costs 

our businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements and the regulations laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs and new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations in the us and other countries in which we operate could materially adversely affect our tax expense andor tax balances changes in tax policies including potential tax reform provisions such as the elimination of the deduction for interest and nondeductibility of all or a portion of the cost of imported materials equipment and commodities could materially adversely impact our business changes in regulations laws and tariffs and how they are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects we discuss potential us federal tax reform further in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing performance” in the annual report 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the california utilities and other sempra energy businesses these rules are commonly referred to as “affiliate rules” which primarily impact commodity and commodityrelated transactions these businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or to their interpretations or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas to or to trade with the california utilities and with each other affiliate rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the california utilities any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the lng terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or other operations of our subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses require numerous permits licenses franchise agreements and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies any failure to obtain or maintain required permits licenses or approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

all of our existing and planned development projects require multiple approvals the acquisition construction ownership and operation of lng terminals natural gas pipelines and distribution and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution facilities and propane and ethane systems require numerous permits licenses franchise agreements certificates and other approvals from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies once received approvals may be subject to litigation and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed or modified in litigation in addition permits licenses franchise agreements certificates and other approvals may be modified rescinded or fail to be extended by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses socalgas’ franchise agreements with the city of los angeles and los angeles county where the aliso canyon facility is located are due to expire in 2017 if there is a delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be precluded from constructing or operating facilities or we may be forced to incur additional costs further accidents beyond our control may cause us to violate the terms of conditional use permits causing delays in projects any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain necessary permits licenses certificates and other approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations and mandates relating to environmental protection including air quality water quality and usage wastewater discharge solid waste management hazardous waste disposal and remediation conservation of natural resources wetlands and wildlife renewable energy resources climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees the california utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs for projects are not recoverable in rates in addition we may be ultimately responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our lng terminals natural gas transmission distribution and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution facilities and other energy projects and properties regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown which exposes us to risks arising from contamination at our former or existing facilities or with respect to offsite waste disposal sites that have been used in our operations in the case of our california and other regulated utilities some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates our facilities including those in our joint ventures are subject to laws and regulations protecting migratory birds which have recently been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to wind farms failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines andor significant curtailments of our operations which could materially adversely affect our cash flows andor results of operations 

increasing international national regional and statelevel concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed state national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations the implementation of recent and proposed california and federal legislation and regulation may materially adversely affect our nonutility businesses by imposing among other things additional costs associated with emission limits controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits similarly california senate bill 350 requires all loadserving entities including sdge to file integrated resource plans that will ultimately enable the electric sector to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of 40 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030 our california utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates even if recoverable the effects of existing and proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth and may have a material adverse effect on the california utilities’ cash flows sdge may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

in addition existing and future laws orders and regulations regarding mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates methane or other emissions could result in requirements for additional monitoring pollution monitoring and control equipment safety practices or emission fees taxes or penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows 

we provide further discussion of these matters in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation against us 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and arbitration proceedings we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and proceedings and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings we discuss pending proceedings in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report the uncertainties inherent in lawsuits arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part in rates from our customers which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations andor financial condition 

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices in addition for those contract positions that are hedged our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition certain of the contracts we use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts in certain cases these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged 

in addition possible changes in federal regulation of overthecounter derivatives regulated by the us commodity futures trading commission could impact the cost and effectiveness of our hedging programs as we discuss in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance ” in the annual report 

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

although we have in place risk management and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by our businesses or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees 

several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a companybycompany basis any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

new business technologies implemented by us or developed by others present a risk for increased attacks on our information systems and the integrity of our energy grid and our natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure 

in addition to general information and cyber risks that all fortune 500 corporations face eg malware malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information smart grid infrastructure and natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure deployment of new business technologies represents a new and largescale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer information as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure while our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malware unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks to date we have not detected a material breach of cybersecurity addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across sempra energy’s businesses but we cannot ensure that a successful attack has not and will not occur an attack on our information systems the integrity of the energy grid our natural gas ethane or propane pipeline and storage infrastructure or one of our facilities or unauthorized access to confidential customer information could result in energy delivery service failures financial loss violations of privacy laws customer dissatisfaction and litigation any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

in the ordinary course of business sempra energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees customer energy usage and other information the theft damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws subject us to claims from third parties require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations and harm our reputation 

finally as seen with recent cyberattacks around the world the goal of a cyberattack may be primarily to inflict largescale harm on a company and the places where it operates any such cyberattack could cause widespread disruptions to our operating and administrative systems including the destruction of critical information and programming that could materially adversely affect our business operations and the integrity of the power grid andor release confidential information about our company and our customers employees and other constituents 

our businesses will need to continue to adapt to technological change which may cause us to incur significant expenditures to adapt to these changes and which efforts may not be successful 

emerging technologies may be superior to or may not be compatible with some of our existing technologies investments and infrastructure and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive or may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets or the operating assets of our equity method investments our future success will depend in part on our ability and our investment partners’ abilities to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets if we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological changes fail to adapt to significant technological changes fail to obtain access to important new technologies fail to recover a significant portion of any remaining investment in obsolete assets or if implemented technology fails to operate as intended our businesses operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected examples of technological changes that could negatively impact our businesses include 

 risks related to the california utilities 

the california utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may materially adversely affect us 

the cpuc regulates the california utilities’ rates except sdge’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates the california utilities’ 



the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance safety standards and practices compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows socalgas and sdge may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines and storage and for sdge electric operations under regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety and citation programs concerning both gas and electric safety which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the california utilities’ rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in notes 13 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

the cpuc periodically approves the california utilities’ rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs including income taxes and an authorized rate of return on investment delays by the cpuc on decisions authorizing recovery or authorizations for less than full recovery may adversely affect the working capital and financial condition of each of the california utilities if the california utilities receive an adverse cpuc decision andor actual capital expenditures andor operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the cpuc our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected reductions in key benchmark interest rates may trigger automatic adjustment mechanisms which would reduce the california utilities’ authorized rates of return changes in which could materially adversely affect their results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

in december 2014 the cpuc issued a decision incorporating a riskbased decisionmaking framework into all future general rate case grc application filings for major natural gas and electric utilities in california as the framework is still in the developing stages we cannot estimate whether its application in future grc applications will result in full recovery of costs we discuss this further in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” in the annual report 

the cpuc applies performancebased measures and mechanisms to all california utilities under these earnings potential over authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals and reductions in authorized base margins are tied to not achieving specific performance and operating goals at both of the california utilities the areas that are currently eligible for performance mechanisms are operational activities designated by the cpuc and energy efficiency programs at sdge electric reliability performance and at socalgas natural gas procurement and unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services although the california utilities have received incentive awards in the past there can be no assurance that they will receive awards in the future or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods additionally if the california utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

in september 2016 california adopted new laws concerning the cpuc that establish rules governing among other subjects communications between cpuc officials cpuc staff and regulated utilities changes to the rules and processes around ex parte  communications could result in delayed decisions increased investigations enforcement actions and penalties in addition the cpuc or other parties may initiate investigations of past communications between public utilities and cpuc officials and staff that could result in reopening completed proceedings for reconsideration 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets and other similar matters involving sdge 

the california utilities may be materially adversely affected by new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies in addition existing legislation or regulations may be revised or reinterpreted new revised or reinterpreted legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how the california utilities operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses 

the construction and expansion of the california utilities’ natural gas pipelines socalgas’ storage facilities and sdge’s electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits licenses rights of way and other approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies including approvals and renewals of rightsofway over native american tribal land held in trust by the federal governments if there are delays in obtaining these approvals failure to obtain or maintain these approvals difficulties in renewing rightsofway and other property rights or failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations the california utilities’ businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially adversely affected coordinating these projects for successful completion requires good execution from our employees and contractors cooperation of third parties and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay in the event that one or more of these projects is delayed or experiences significant cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on the california utilities the california utilities could experience difficulties in renewing rightsofway or other forms of property rights for existing assets which could have a material adverse effect on the california utilities the california utilities may invest a significant amount of money in a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if the project does not receive regulatory approval if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes or if management decides not to proceed with the project they may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project which could materially adversely affect their financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

our california utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as the utility reform network turn utility consumers’ action network sierra club and other stakeholder advocacy and activist groups operations that may be influenced by these groups include 

 socalgas will incur significant costs and expenses related to remediating the natural gas leak at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and to mitigate local community and environmental impacts from the leak some or a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance and socalgas also may incur significant liabilities for fines penalties damages and greenhouse gas mitigation activities as a result of this incident some or a significant portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance 

in october 2015 socalgas discovered a leak at one of its injectionandwithdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility located in the northern part of the san fernando valley in los angeles county the aliso canyon facility has been operated by socalgas since 1972 ss25 is more than one mile away from and 1200 feet above the closest homes it is one of more than 100 injectionandwithdrawal wells at the storage facility socalgas worked closely with several of the world’s leading experts to stop the leak and in february 2016 doggr confirmed that the well was permanently sealed 

local community mitigation efforts 

pursuant to a stipulation and order by the los angeles county superior court superior court socalgas provided temporary relocation support to residents in the nearby community who requested it before the well was permanently sealed at significant expense to socalgas following the permanent sealing of the well and the completion of the los angeles county department of public health’s dph indoor testing of certain homes in the porter ranch community which concluded that indoor conditions did not present a longterm health risk and that it was safe for residents to return home the superior court issued an order in may 2016 ruling that currently relocated residents be given the choice to request residence cleaning prior to returning home with such cleaning to be performed according to the dph’s proposed protocol and at socalgas’ expense socalgas completed the cleaning program and the relocation program ended in july 2016 

apart from the superior court order in may 2016 the dph also issued a directive that socalgas professionally clean in accordance with the proposed protocol prepared by the dph the homes of all residents located within the porter ranch neighborhood council boundary or who participated in the relocation program or who are located within a five mile radius of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and have experienced symptoms from the natural gas leak the directive socalgas disputes the directive contending that it is invalid and unenforceable and has filed a petition for writ of mandate to set aside the directive 

the total costs incurred to mitigate local community impacts of the leak are significant and may increase and to the extent not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

governmental investigations and civil and criminal litigation 

various governmental agencies including doggr dph scaqmd carb los angeles regional water quality control board california division of occupational safety and health cpuc phmsa epa los angeles county district attorney’s office and california attorney general’s office have investigated or are investigating this incident other federal agencies eg the doe and us department of the interior investigated the incident in conjunction with the preparation of an interagency task force report ensuring safe and reliable underground natural gas storage  published in october 2016 in january 2016 doggr and the cpuc selected blade energy partners to conduct an independent analysis under their supervision and to be funded by socalgas to investigate the technical root cause of the aliso canyon gas leak this investigation is currently ongoing 

as of february 27 2017 250  lawsuits including over 14000  plaintiffs have been filed against socalgas some of which have also named sempra energy these various lawsuits assert causes of action for negligence negligence per se strict liability property damage fraud public and private nuisance continuing and permanent trespass inverse condemnation fraudulent concealment unfair business practices and loss of consortium among other things a complaint alleging violations of proposition 65 was also filed many of these complaints seek class action status compensatory and punitive damages civil penalties injunctive relief costs of future medical monitoring and attorneys’ fees 

in addition to the lawsuits described above a federal securities class action alleging violation of the federal securities laws has been filed against sempra energy and certain of its officers and directors and four shareholder derivative actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties have been filed against certain officers and directors of sempra energy andor socalgas three complaints have also been filed by public entities including the california attorney general the scaqmd and the county of los angeles these complaints seek various remedies including injunctive relief abatement of the public nuisance civil penalties payment of the cost of a longitudinal health study and money damages as well as punitive damages and attorneys’ fees in february 2017 socalgas entered into a settlement agreement with the scaqmd under which socalgas will pay 85 million and scaqmd will dismiss its complaint and petition for dismissal of a stipulated abatement order issued by its hearing board separately in february 2016 the los angeles county district attorney’s office filed a misdemeanor criminal complaint against socalgas seeking penalties and other remedies for alleged failure to provide timely notice of the leak and for allegedly violating certain california health and safety code provisions on november 29 2016 the court approved a settlement between socalgas and the district attorney’s office whereby socalgas agreed to plead no contest to a misdemeanor for the alleged failure to provide timely notice of the leak and to spend approximately 43 million on reimbursement of government agency expenses operational commitments and fines and penalties in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining counts certain individuals residing near aliso canyon who objected to the settlement have filed a notice of appeal of the judgment as well as a petition asking the superior court to set aside the november 29 2016 order and grant them restitution 

additional litigation may be filed against us in the future related to the aliso canyon incident or our responses thereto for a more detailed description of the governmental investigations and civil and criminal lawsuits brought against us see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

the costs of defending against the civil and criminal lawsuits cooperating with the various investigations and any damages restitution and civil and criminal fines costs and other penalties if awarded or imposed could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

governmental orders and additional regulation 

in january 2016 the governor of the state of california issued an order proclaiming a state of emergency to exist in los angeles county due to the natural gas leak at the aliso canyon facility the governor’s order imposed various orders with respect to stopping the leak protecting public health and safety ensuring accountability and strengthening oversight also in january 2016 the hearing board of the scaqmd ordered socalgas to take various actions in connection with injections and withdrawals of natural gas at aliso canyon sealing the well monitoring reporting safety and funding a health study among other things as discussed above socalgas has entered into a settlement agreement with the scaqmd that calls for the scaqmd to petition its hearing board for dismissal of the order we provide further detail regarding the governor’s order and scaqmd’s order in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

in december 2015 socalgas made a commitment to mitigate the actual natural gas released from the leak and has been working on a plan to accomplish the mitigation in march 2016 pursuant to the governor’s order the carb issued its recommended approach to achieve full mitigation of the climate impacts from the aliso canyon natural gas leak which includes recommendations that 

 in october 2016 carb issued a final report concluding that the incident resulted in total emissions from 90350 to 108950 metric tons of methane and asserting that socalgas should mitigate 109000 metric tons of methane to fully mitigate the greenhouse gas impacts of the leak although we have not agreed with carb’s estimate of methane released we continue to work with carb on developing a mitigation plan the costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

in june 2016 the “protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of 2016” or the “pipes act of 2016” was enacted among other things the pipes act requires phmsa to issue within two years of passage “minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities” and imposes a “user fee” on underground storage facilities as needed to implement the safety standards in october 2016 the interagency task force formed by the doe and phmsa in response to the leak at aliso canyon issued its report recommending that phmsa adopt new safety regulations and providing 44 specific recommendations to industry and to federal state and local regulators and governments which may result in additional regulations 

phmsa doggr scaqmd epa and carb have each commenced separate rulemaking proceedings to adopt further regulations covering natural gas storage facilities and injection wells doggr has issued new draft regulations for all storage fields in california and in 2016 the california legislature enacted four separate bills providing for additional regulation of natural gas storage facilities also the los angeles county board of supervisors formed a task force to review and potentially implement new more stringent land use zoning requirements and associated regulations and enforcement protocols for oil and gas activities including natural gas storage field operations we provide further detail regarding new regulations and legislation in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” and note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

additional hearings in the california legislature as well as with various other federal and state regulatory agencies have been or may be scheduled additional legislation has been proposed in the california legislature and additional laws orders rules and regulations may be adopted higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas as a result of new laws orders rules and regulations arising out of the aliso canyon incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates and socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any such new laws orders rules and regulations 

natural gas storage operations and reliability 

natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods including peak electric generation needs in the summer and heating needs in the winter aliso canyon with a storage capacity of 86 bcf which represents 63 percent of socalgas’ natural gas storage inventory capacity is the largest socalgas storage facility and an important element of socalgas’ delivery system socalgas has not injected natural gas into aliso canyon since october 25 2015 pursuant to orders by doggr and the governor and sb 380 limited withdrawals of natural gas from aliso canyon have been made in 2017 to augment natural gas supplies during critical demand periods in november 2016 socalgas submitted a request to doggr seeking authorization to resume injection operations at the aliso canyon storage facility in accordance with sb 380 doggr held public meetings on february 1 and 2 2017 to receive public comment on doggr’s findings from its gas storage and well safety review and proposed pressure limits for the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility the public comment period has expired it remains for doggr to issue its safety determination after which the cpuc must concur with doggr’s determination before injections at the facility can resume 

if the aliso canyon facility were to be taken out of service for any meaningful period of time it could result in an impairment of the facility significantly higher than expected operating costs andor additional capital expenditures and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized at december 31 2016 the aliso canyon facility has a net book value of 531 million including 217 million of construction work in progress for the project to construct a new compression station any significant impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations for the period in which it is recorded higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas may not be recoverable in customer rates and socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

insurance and estimated costs 

excluding directors and officers liability insurance we have four kinds of insurance policies that together provide between 12 billion to 14 billion in insurance coverage depending on the nature of the claims these policies are subject to various policy limits exclusions and conditions we have been communicating with our insurance carriers and we have received 169 million of insurance proceeds for control of well expenses and temporary relocation costs we intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for the costs we have incurred or may incur our recorded estimate as of december 31 2016 of 780 million of certain costs in connection with the aliso canyon storage facility leak may rise significantly as more information becomes available in addition any costs not included in the 780 million estimate could be material the 780 million estimate does not include unsettled damage claims restitution or civil administrative or criminal fines costs and other penalties in addition such estimate excludes the costs to clean additional homes pursuant to the dph directive future legal costs to defend litigation and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining insurance coverage for these costs under the applicable policies and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining coverage or if such costs are not covered by insurance including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

additional information 

we discuss aliso canyon matters further in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance ” in the annual report 

natural gas pipeline safety assessments may not be fully or adequately recovered in rates 

pending the outcome of various regulatory agency evaluations of natural gas pipeline safety regulations practices and procedures sempra energy including the california utilities may incur incremental expense and capital investment associated with their natural gas pipeline operations and investments the california utilities filed implementation plans with the cpuc to test or replace natural gas transmission pipelines located in populated areas that either have not been pressure tested or lack sufficient documentation of a pressure test to enhance existing valve infrastructure and to retrofit pipelines to allow for the use of inline inspection technology referred to as socalgas’ and sdge’s pipeline safety enhancement plan psep 

in june 2014 the cpuc issued a final decision approving the utilities’ plan for implementing psep and established criteria to determine the amounts related to psep that may be recovered from ratepayers and the processes for recovery of such amounts including providing that such costs are subject to a reasonableness review in the future certain psep costs may be subject to recovery as determined by separate regulatory filings with the cpuc including grc filings 

various pseprelated proceedings are regularly pending before the cpuc regarding the california utilities’ reasonableness review and cost recovery requests which are often challenged by intervening parties these proceedings are described in more detail in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance ” in the annual report in the future consumer advocacy groups may similarly challenge the california utilities’ petitions for recovery and recommend disallowances in whole or in part with respect to applications to recover psep costs 

from 2011 through 2016 socalgas and sdge have invested 11 billion and 302 million respectively in psep as of december 31 2016 socalgas has received approval for recovery of 33 million if the cpuc were to deny rate recovery for psep and other gas pipeline safety costs incurred by socalgas and sdge it could materially adversely affect the respective company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the california utilities are subject to increasingly stringent safety standards and the potential for significant penalties if regulators deem either sdge or socalgas to be out of compliance 

california senate bill sb 291 requires the cpuc to develop and maintain a safety enforcement program that includes procedures for monitoring data tracking and analysis and investigations and delegates citation authority to cpuc staff personnel under the direction of the cpuc executive director in exercising this citation authority the cpuc staff is to take into account voluntary reporting of potential violations voluntary resolution efforts undertaken prior history of violations the gravity of the violation and the degree of culpability the cpuc previously implemented both electric and gas safety enforcement programs whereby electric and gas utilities may be cited by cpuc staff for violations of the cpuc’s safety requirements or applicable federal standards 

under each enforcement program each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense the maximum penalty is 50000 per offense citations under either program may be appealed to the cpuc penalties imposed under these programs can be significant exceeding 15 billion in one instance in september 2016 the cpuc issued a decision making further refinements to the electric and gas safety enforcement programs the decision harmonizes the rules for the two programs further defines the criteria for issuing a citation and penalty sets an administrative limit of 8 million per citation issued by staff under its delegated authority and makes certain other changes to rules related to selfreporting and notifying local officials 

if the cpuc or its staff determine that either of sdge’s or socalgas’ operations and practices are not in compliance with applicable safety standards and operating procedures the corrective or mitigation actions required to be in conformance if not sufficiently funded in customer rates and any penalties imposed could materially adversely affect that company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the failure by the cpuc to continue reforms of sdge’s rate structure including the implementation of a more significant fixed charge could have a material adverse effect on its business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

the current electric rate structure in california is primarily based on consumption volume which places an undue burden on residential customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers as higher electric use residential customers switch to selfgeneration or obtain local offthegrid sources of power such as wind the burden on the remaining higher electric use customers increases which in turn encourages more selfgeneration further increasing rate pressure on existing customers in july 2015 the cpuc adopted a decision that establishes comprehensive reform and a framework for rates that are more transparent fair and sustainable the decision provides for a minimum monthly bill fewer rate tiers and a gradual reduction in the differences between the tiered rates directs the utilities to pursue expanded time of use rates and implements a superuser electric surcharge in 2017 for usage that exceeds average customer usage by approximately 400 percent within each climate zone the surcharge will increase over time ultimately reaching a rate of more than double the first tier rate the decision will be implemented over a five year period from 2015 to 2020 and should result in significant relief for higheruse customers that do not exceed the superuser threshold and a rate structure that better aligns rates with actual costs to serve customers the decision also establishes a process for utilities to seek implementation of a fixed charge for residential customers in 2020 but it also sets certain conditions for the implementation of a fixed charge after the initial reforms are implemented the establishment of a fixed charge for residential customers may become more critical to help ensure rates are fair for all customers as distributed energy resources could generally reduce delivered volumes and increase fixed costs 

if the cpuc fails to continue to reform sdge’s rate structure by implementing a rate structure that maintains reasonable costbased electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system such failure could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

meaningful net energy metering or nem reform must continue to progress to ensure that sdge is authorized to recover its costs in providing services to nem customers while minimizing the cost shift or subsidy being borne by nonsolar customers 

due to current rate structures and state policies customers who selfgenerate their own power using eligible renewable resources primarily solar installations currently do not pay their proportionate cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system subject to certain limitations while they still receive power from the system when their selfgeneration is inadequate to meet their electricity needs the proportionate costs not paid by nem customers are paid ie subsidized by consumers not participating in nem in addition the continuing increase of selfgenerated solar other forms of selfgeneration and other local offthegrid sources of power adversely impacts the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system 

appropriate nem reforms are necessary to ensure that sdge is authorized to recover from nem customers the costs incurred in providing grid and energy services as well as mandated legislative and regulatory public policy programs sdge believes this design would be preferable to recovering these costs from customers not participating in nem if nem selfgenerating installations were to increase substantially between 2016 and when more significant reforms take effect in 2019 or later as described below the rate structure adopted by the cpuc could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

in july 2014 the cpuc initiated a rulemaking proceeding to develop a successor tariff to the state’s existing nem program pursuant to the provisions of ab 327 the nem program was originally established in 1995 and is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of onsite renewable generation under nem qualifying customergenerators receive a full retail rate for the energy they generate that is fed back to the utility’s power grid this occurs during times when the customer’s generation exceeds their own energy usage in addition if a nem customer generates any electricity over the annual measurement period that exceeds its annual consumption they receive compensation at a rate equal to a wholesale energy price 

in january 2016 the cpuc adopted a decision making modest changes to the nem program which require nem customers to pay some costs that would otherwise be borne by nonnem customers and moves new nem customers to timeofuse rates together with a reduction in tiered rate differentials and the potential implementation of a fixed charge component in 2020 these changes to the nem program begin a process of reducing the cost burden on nonnem customers but sdge believes that further reforms are necessary and appropriate in march 2016 sdge edison pge turn and the california coalition of utility employees filed applications with the cpuc requesting rehearing of its january 2016 decision in september 2016 the cpuc issued an order denying the rehearing requests in all respects sdge implemented the adopted successor nem tariff in july 2016 after reaching the 617mw cap established for the prior nem program 

the electricity industry is undergoing significant change including increased deployment of distributed energy resources technological advancements and political and regulatory developments 

electric utilities in california are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources such as solar energy storage energy efficiency and demand response technologies this growth will eventually require modernization of the electric distribution grid to among other things accommodate twoway flows of electricity and increase the grid’s capacity to interconnect distributed energy resources the cpuc is conducting proceedings to evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources to consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments to evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources and if feasible what if any compensation would be appropriate and to clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator these proceedings may result in new regulations policies andor operational changes that could materially adversely affect sdge’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

sdge provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a longterm basis while sdge provides such procurement service for the majority of its customer load customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than sdge through programs such as direct access and community choice aggregation cca direct access is currently closed but utility customers have the ability to receive procurement through cca if the customer’s local jurisdiction city offers such a program a number of cities in our service territory have expressed interest in cca which if widely adopted could result in substantial reductions in the load we are required to serve when customers are served by another load serving entity sdge no longer serves this departing load and the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources are borne by its remaining bundled procurement customers this issue is addressed by rate mechanisms that attempt to ensure bundled ratepayer indifference in the event of departing load but these existing mechanisms may not be sufficient to address the full extent of the potential cost shift in the event of significant departing load and sdge bears some risk that its procured resources become stranded and the associated costs are not recoverable 

in addition the ferc has adopted changes that have opened transmission development to competition from independent developers allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities these changes could materially adversely affect sdge’s business and prospects 

recovery of 2007 wildfire litigation costs requires future regulatory approval and insurance coverage for future wildfires may not be sufficient to cover losses we may incur 

sdge is seeking to recover in rates its reasonably incurred costs of resolving 2007 wildfire claims in excess of its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties through december 31 2016  sdge’s payments for claim settlements plus funds estimated to be required for settlement of outstanding claims and legal fees have exceeded its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties however sdge has concluded that it is probable that it will be permitted to recover in rates a substantial portion of the reasonably incurred costs of resolving wildfire claims in excess of its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties at december 31 2016  sempra energy’s and sdge’s consolidated balance sheets included 352 million  in other regulatory assets longterm related to cpucregulated operations for these costs incurred and the estimated resolution of pending claims 

in december 2012 the cpuc issued a final decision allowing sdge to maintain an authorized memorandum account enabling sdge to file applications with the cpuc requesting recovery of amounts properly recorded in the memorandum account subject to reasonableness review at a later date in september 2015 sdge filed an application with the cpuc requesting rate recovery of such costs and is proposing to recover the costs in rates over a six to tenyear period the cpuc has scheduled a twophased proceeding to address sdge’s request sdge has responded to testimony submitted by intervening parties raising various concerns with sdge’s operations and management prior to and during the 2007 wildfires and have asked the cpuc to reject sdge’s request for cost recovery we discuss these cost recovery proceedings in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance ” and in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

recovery of these costs in rates will require future regulatory approval sdge will continue to assess the likelihood amount and timing of such recoveries in rates should sdge conclude that recovery of excess wildfire costs in rates is no longer probable at that time sdge would record a charge against earnings if sdge had concluded that the recovery of regulatory assets related to cpucregulated operations was no longer probable or was less than currently estimated at december 31 2016 the resulting aftertax charge against earnings would have been up to approximately 208 million a failure to obtain substantial or full recovery of these costs from customers or any negative assessment of the likelihood of recovery would likely have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s and sdge’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations we discuss how we assess the probability of recovery of our regulatory assets in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

we have experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the california utilities’ operations in addition the insurance that has been obtained for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses that we may incur uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates a loss which is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially adversely affect sempra energy’s and the affected california utility’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations furthermore insurance for wildfire liabilities may not continue to be available at all or at rates or with terms similar to those presently available 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility that is being decommissioned 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california that is in the process of being decommissioned by edison the majority owner of songs songs is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc and the cpuc on june 6 2013 edison notified sdge that it had reached a decision to permanently retire songs and seek approval from the nrc to start the decommissioning activities for the entire facility sdge and each of the other owners holds its undivided interest as a tenant in common in the property and each owner is responsible for financing its share of expenses and capital expenditures including decommissioning activities although the facility is being decommissioned sdge’s ownership interest in songs continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility which include 

 in addition sdge maintains nuclear decommissioning trusts for the purpose of providing funds to decommission songs trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities which are subject to significant market fluctuations a decline in the market value of trust assets or an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts could increase the funding requirements for these trusts which in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates furthermore cpuc approval is required in order to make withdrawals from these trusts cpuc approval for certain expenditures may be denied by the cpuc altogether if the cpuc determines that the expenditures are unreasonable finally decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the trust funds rate recovery for overruns would require cpuc approval which may not occur 

interpretations of tax regulations could impact access to nuclear decommissioning trust funds for reimbursement of spent nuclear fuel management costs depending on how the internal revenue service irs or the us department of treasury ultimately interprets or alters regulations addressing the taxation of a qualified nuclear decommissioning trust sdge may be restricted from withdrawing amounts from its qualified decommissioning trusts to pay for spent fuel management where edison and sdge are seeking or plan to seek recovery of spent fuel management costs in litigation against or in settlements with the doe in december 2016 the irs and the us department of treasury issued proposed regulations that clarify the definition of “nuclear decommissioning costs” that may be paid for or reimbursed from a qualified fund these proposed regulations are not yet finalized but sdge is working with outside counsel to clarify with the irs some of the provisions in the proposed regulations to confirm that the proposed regulations will allow sdge to access the trust funds for reimbursement or payment of the spent fuel management costs incurred in 2016 and subsequent years until the doe litigation is resolved andor irs regulations regarding spent fuel management costs are confirmed to apply sdge expects to continue to pay for such spent fuel management costs if sdge is unable to obtain timely access to the trusts for these costs sdge’s cash flows could be negatively impacted 

in november 2014 the cpuc approved the amended settlement agreement that resolved the investigation into the steam generator replacement project that ultimately led to the shutdown of songs various petitions have since been filed to reopen the settlement in december 2016 the commissioner and administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding issued a ruling directing sdge and edison to “meet and confer” with other parties to the proceeding to determine whether an agreement could be reached to modify the amended settlement agreement previously approved by the cpuc to resolve allegations that unreported ex parte  communications between edison and the cpuc resulted in an unfair advantage at the time the settlement agreement was negotiated if no agreement to modify the amended settlement agreement is reached by april 28 2017 the cpuc will consider other options including entertaining additional testimony hearings and briefs we cannot assure you that the amended settlement agreement will not be renegotiated modified or set aside as a result of this proceeding we provide additional detail in note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

the occurrence of any of these events could result in a substantial reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

risks related to our sempra south american utilities and sempra infrastructure businesses 

our businesses are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices and our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks energyrelated commodity prices impact lng liquefaction and regasification the transport and storage of natural gas and power generation from renewable and conventional sources among other businesses that we operate and invest in 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for lng terminals or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas lng electricity or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions in particular north american natural gas prices when in decline negatively impact profitability at sempra lng  midstream  

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated commodities result from multiple factors including 

 the ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

when our businesses enter into fixedprice longterm contracts to provide services or commodities they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks 

sempra mexico sempra renewables and sempra lng  midstream  generally endeavor to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure however if these contracts are at fixed prices the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures including rising operational costs costs of labor materials equipment and commodities and rising interest rates that affect financing costs we may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects providing for cost escalation providing for direct passthrough of operating costs or entering into hedges however these measures if implemented may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses andor financing costs the failure to fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled or be completed within budget which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the acquisition development construction and expansion of lng terminals natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built 

success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 successful completion of a particular project may be materially adversely affected by among other factors 

 if we are unable to complete a development project or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or natural gas regasification liquefaction and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification liquefaction storage transmission and distribution systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

the design development and construction of the cameron lng liquefaction facility involves numerous risks and uncertainties 

with respect to our project to add lng export capability at the cameron lng facility the cameron lng holdings llc joint venture cameron lng jv is building an lng export facility consisting of three liquefaction trains designed to a total nameplate capacity of 139  million tonnes per annum mtpa of lng with an expected export capability of 12  mtpa of lng or approximately 17  bcf per day the anticipated incremental investment in the threetrain liquefaction project is estimated to be approximately 7 billion  including the cost of the lumpsum turnkey construction contract development engineering costs and permitting costs but excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs the total cost of the facility including the cost of our original regasification facility contributed to the joint venture plus interest during construction financing costs and required reserves is estimated to be approximately 10 billion  if construction financing or other project costs are higher than we currently expect we may have to contribute additional cash exceeding our current estimates the majority of the incremental investment in the joint venture will be projectfinanced and the balance provided by the project partners any failure by the project partners to make their required investments on a timely basis could result in project delays and could materially adversely affect the development of the project in addition sempra energy has guaranteed a maximum of 39 billion  related to the project financing and financingrelated agreements these guarantees terminate upon cameron lng jv’s achieving “financial completion” of the initial threetrain liquefaction project including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests if due to the joint venture’s failure to satisfy the financial completion criteria we are required to repay some or all of the 39 billion  under our guarantees any such repayments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

largescale construction projects like the design development and construction of the cameron lng liquefaction facility involve numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the potential for unforeseen engineering problems substantial construction delays and increased costs cameron lng jv has a turnkey epc contract with a joint venture contractor comprised of subsidiaries of chicago bridge  iron company nv and chiyoda corporation who are jointly and severally liable for performance under the contract if the contractor becomes unwilling or unable to perform according to the terms and timetable of the epc contract cameron lng jv may be required to engage a substitute contractor which would result in project delays and increased costs which could be significant the construction of this facility requires a large and specialized work force necessary equipment and materials and sophisticated engineering there can be no assurance that cameron lng jv’s contractor will not encounter delays due to disruptions in obtaining the necessary equipment and materials inability to field the necessary workforce weather conditions or engineering issues that were not contemplated in october 2016 cameron lng jv received an indication from the epc contractor that the respective inservice dates for each train may be delayed any such construction delays will defer a portion of the 2018 and 2019 earnings anticipated from the cameron lng project as construction progresses cameron lng jv may decide or be forced to submit change orders to the contractor that could result in longer construction periods and higher construction costs or both in addition new regulations labor disputes breakdown or failure of equipment and litigation could substantially delay the project as we do not control cameron lng jv we are dependent on reaching a consensus with one or more of our joint venture partners to resolve a variety of issues that could transpire the inability to timely resolve issues including construction issues could cause substantial delays to the completion of this project a substantial delay could result in cost overruns substantially postpone the earnings we anticipate deriving from this facility and require additional cash investments by us and our joint venture partners the anticipated cost of this project is based on a number of assumptions that may prove incorrect and the ultimate cost could significantly exceed the current estimate of approximately 7 billion  of incremental investment excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

we face many challenges to develop and complete our contemplated lng export facilities 

in addition to the threetrain cameron lng liquefaction facility described above we are looking at several other lng export terminal development opportunities including a greenfield project in port arthur texas a brownfield project at our existing energía costa azul regasification facility in baja california mexico and an expansion of up to two additional liquefaction trains to the cameron liquefaction facility each of these contemplated projects faces numerous risks and must overcome significant hurdles before we can proceed with construction common to all of these projects is the risk that an extended decline in current and forward projections of crude oil prices could reduce the demand for natural gas in some sectors and cause a corresponding reduction in projected global demand for lng this could result in increased competition among those working on projects in an environment of declining lng demand such as the sempra energysponsored export initiatives such reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of coal in new power generation which could also lead to increased competition among the lng suppliers for the declining lng demand oil prices at certain moderate levels could also make lng projects in other parts of the world still feasible and competitive with lng projects from north america thus increasing supply and the competition for the available lng demand a decline in natural gas prices outside the united states which in many foreign countries are based on the price of crude oil may also materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices based on henry hub pricing 

sempra lng  midstream has entered into a project development agreement for the joint development of the proposed port arthur liquefaction project with an affiliate of woodside petroleum ltd the agreement specifies how the parties will share costs and establishes a framework for the parties to work jointly on permitting design engineering and commercial and marketing activities associated with developing the port arthur liquefaction project also sempra lng  midstream ienova and a subsidiary of petróleos mexicanos or pemex the mexican stateowned oil company entered into a project development agreement for the joint development of the proposed liquefaction project at ienova’s existing energía costa azul regasification facility in mexico the agreement specifies how the parties will share costs and establishes a framework for the parties to work jointly on permitting design engineering and commercial activities associated with developing the potential liquefaction project we are sharing costs with pemex on the development efforts any decisions by the parties to proceed with binding agreements with respect to the formation of these potential joint ventures and the potential development of these projects will require among other things completion of project assessments and achieving other necessary internal and external approvals of each such party in addition all of our proposed projects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the receipt of a number of permits and approvals finding suitable partners and customers obtaining financing and incentives negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including joint venture agreements tolling capacity agreements or natural gas supply and lng sales agreements and construction contracts and reaching a final investment decision 

expansion of the cameron lng liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the joint venture project financing agreements including among others timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the project lenders under the cameron lng jv equity agreements the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all of the partners including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner one of the partners indicated to sempra energy and the other partners that it does not intend to invest additional capital in cameron lng jv with respect to the expansion as a result discussions among the partners have occurred and we are considering a variety of options to attempt to move the expansion project forward these activities have contributed to delays in developing firm pricing information and securing customer commitments in light of these developments we cannot assure you that the various consents required for expansion of the cameron lng project will be obtained 

furthermore there are a number of potential new projects under construction or in the process of development by various project developers in north america in addition to ours and given the projected global demand for lng the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed with respect to our port arthur texas project this is a greenfield site and therefore it may not have the advantages often associated with brownfield sites the energía costa azul facility in mexico is subject to ongoing land disputes that could make project financing difficult as well as finding suitable partners and customers in addition while we have completed the regulatory process for an lng export facility in the us the regulatory process in mexico and the overlay of us regulations for natural gas exports to an lng export facility in mexico are not well developed there can be no assurance that such a facility could be permitted and constructed without facing significant legal challenges and uncertainties which in turn could make project financing as well as finding suitable partners and customers difficult finally energía costa azul has profitable longterm regasification contracts for 100 percent of the facility making the decision to pursue a new liquefaction facility dependent in part on whether the investment in a new liquefaction facility would over the long term be more beneficial than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts 

there can be no assurance that our contemplated lng export facilities will be completed and our inability to complete one or more of our contemplated lng export facilities could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows results of operations and prospects 

we discuss these projects further in “our business” and “ factors influencing future performance” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could reduce or eliminate lng export opportunities and demand 

several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations to impose more stringent permitting public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations in addition to state laws some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions such as city ordinances that may restrict the performance of or prohibit the well drilling in general andor hydraulic fracturing in particular hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions but federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities for example the epa issued permitting guidance in february 2014 under the federal safe drinking water act sdwa for hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels in april 2015 the epa issued a proposed rule that would prevent the discharge of hydraulic fracturing wastewater into publicly owned treatment works and in march 2015 the bureau of land management of the us department of the interior adopted rules imposing new requirements for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands including new requirements relating to public disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals as well as wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water in addition the us congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process there are also certain governmental reviews that have been conducted or are underway on deep shale and other formation completion and production practices including hydraulic fracturing depending on the outcome of these studies federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate or even ban such activities certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process 

we cannot predict whether additional federal state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit if additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations natural gas prices in north america could rise which in turn could materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices based on henry hub pricing increased regulation or difficulty in permitting of hydraulic fracturing and any corresponding increase in domestic natural gas prices could materially adversely affect demand for lng exports and our ability to develop commercially viable lng export facilities beyond the three train cameron lng facility currently under construction 

increased competition and changes in trade policies could materially adversely affect us 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors many of whom have extensive and diversified developmental andor operating experience including both domestic and international and financial resources similar to or greater than ours further in recent years the natural gas pipeline storage and lng market segments have been characterized by strong and increasing competition both with respect to winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets in mexico despite the commissioning of many new energy infrastructure projects by the federal electricity commission comisión federal de electricidad or cfe and other governmental agencies in connection with energy reforms competition for recent pipeline projects has been intense with numerous bidders competing aggressively for these projects there can be no assurance that we will be successful in bidding for new development opportunities in the us mexico or south america in addition as noted above there are a number of potential new lng liquefaction projects under construction or in the process of being developed by various project developers in north america including our contemplated new projects and given the projected global demand for lng it is likely that most of these projects will not be completed finally as existing contracts expire at our natural gas storage assets in the gulf coast region we compete with other facilities for storage customers that could continue to support the existing book value of these assets and for anchor customers that could support development of new capacity these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

in addition the current us administration has previously indicated its intention to renegotiate trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement or nafta a shift in us trade policies could materially adversely affect our lng development opportunities as well as opportunities for trade between mexico and the united states 

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into extend or replace expiring longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition such longterm contracts once entered into increase our credit risk if our counterparties fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis due to bankruptcy insolvency or otherwise 

the energía costa azul lng facility and the cameron lng facility within the cameron lng jv have entered into longterm capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties at each facility under these agreements customers pay capacity reservation and usage fees to receive store and regasify the customers’ lng we also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

at cameron lng jv although the cameron lng terminal is partially contracted for regasification there is a termination agreement in place that will result in the termination of the regasification contract at the point during the construction of the new liquefaction facilities where piping tieins to the existing regasification terminal become necessary 

for the threetrain liquefaction facility currently under construction cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with engie sa formerly gdf suez sa and affiliates of mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd that subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the facility if the counterparties to these tolling agreements were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations to cameron lng jv on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

sempra mexico’s and sempra lng  midstream ’s ability to enter into or replace existing longterm firm capacity agreements for their natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include our lng facilities a significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

our natural gas storage assets include operational and development assets at bay gas storage company ltd bay gas in alabama and mississippi hub llc mississippi hub in mississippi as well as our development project la storage llc la storage in louisiana la storage could be positioned to support lng export from the cameron lng jv terminal and other liquefaction projects if anticipated cash flows support further investment however changes in the us natural gas market could also lead to diminished natural gas storage values historically the value of natural gas storage services has positively correlated with the difference between the seasonal prices of natural gas among other factors in general over the past several years seasonal differences in natural gas prices have declined which have contributed to lower prices for storage services as our legacy higher rate sales contracts mature at our bay gas and mississippi hub facilities replacement sales contract rates have been and could continue to be lower than has historically been the case lower sales revenues may not be offset by cost reductions which could lead to depressed asset values in addition our la storage development project may be unable to either attract cash flow commitments sufficient to support further investment or extend its ferc construction permit beyond its current expiration date of june 2017 the la storage project also includes an existing 233mile pipeline header system the la storage pipeline that is not contracted market conditions could result in the need to perform recovery testing of our recorded asset values in the event such values are not recoverable we would consider the fair value of these assets relative to their recorded value to the extent the recorded carrying value is in excess of the fair value we would record a noncash impairment charge the recorded value of our longlived natural gas storage assets at december 31 2016  was 15 billion a significant impairment charge related to our natural gas storage assets would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility and we may be unable to sell the power that sempra renewables’ and sempra mexico’s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

we provide information about these matters in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to perform we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

our businesses and the businesses that we invest in are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements or arrangements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements or arrangements should they fail to perform we may be required to enter into alternative arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such an event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition many such agreements are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses the failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects finally we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

in november 2015 a major us credit rating agency revised pemex’s global foreign currency and local currency credit ratings from a3 to baa1 and changed the outlook for its credit ratings to negative in march 2016 the same major credit rating agency further downgraded pemex’s global foreign currency and local currency credit ratings from baa1 to baa3 in may october and december 2016 in connection with debt offerings by pemex the same major credit agency reaffirmed that the outlook on pemex’s credit ratings remains negative pemex is also subject to the control of the mexican government which could limit its ability to satisfy its external debt obligations although pemex is a state productive enterprise of mexico its financing obligations are not guaranteed by the mexican government as both a partner in a sempra mexico joint venture that holds a 50percent interest in the los ramones norte pipeline project and a customer with capacity contracts for transportation services on sempra mexico’s ethane pipelines if pemex were unable to meet any or all of its obligations to sempra mexico it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects 

sempra mexico’s and sempra lng  midstream ’s obligations and those of their suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for “force majeure” events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

our businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits 

we are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties adjacent to and properties where our lng terminal in mexico is located as we discuss in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report in the event that we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which our lng terminal is located we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such terminal in addition our ability to convert the lng terminal into an export facility may be hindered by these disputes and they could make project financing such a facility and finding suitable partners and customers very difficult if we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

we are also engaged in disputes regarding permits at our energía sierra juárez wind project in mexico as we discuss in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

we rely on transportation assets and services much of which we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to 

 sempra mexico and sempra lng  midstream  also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra mexico and sempra lng  midstream  also rely on specialized ships to transport lng to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities sempra renewables sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities electricity and other services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity natural gas supplies and lng at thencurrent spot market rates which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges 

in mexico we own or have interests in natural gas distribution and transportation liquid petroleum gas storage and transportation facilities ethane transportation electricity generation distribution and transmission facilities and an lng terminal in peru and chile we own or have interests in electricity generation transmission and distribution facilities and operations developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political legal regulatory and financial risks that vary by country including 

 our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could materially reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries we may or may not choose to hedge these risks and any hedges entered into may or may not be effective fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in significantly increased taxes in foreign countries and materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

we discuss litigation related to sempra mexico’s energía costa azul lng terminal and other international energy projects in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

ienova’s completed acquisitions of the remaining 50percent interest in the gasoductos de chihuahua joint venture and of the ventika wind power generation facilities will subject ienova to integration challenges and risks 

ienova’s completed acquisitions of the remaining 50percent interest in the gasoductos de chihuahua joint venture from pemex tri and of the ventika i and ventika ii wind power facilities from fisterra energy and certain minority shareholders will subject ienova to substantial integration challenges and risks ienova’s expectations for the operating performance of the existing projects and the projects under construction by gasoductos de chihuahua are based on assumptions and estimates derived from its prior experience in the development of joint venture projects with pemex tri and ienova’s expectations regarding the results of operations of the ventika wind power generation facilities are based on its due diligence and assumptions and estimates regarding the future productivity of those assets the ability of these entities to achieve their expected results is subject to the risks inherent in the development construction and management of energy projects generally following these acquisitions gasoductos de chihuahua andor the ventika wind power generation facilities may not perform as expected and the revenues generated by such acquisitions may prove insufficient to support the financing utilized to acquire such entities or to maintain such acquisitions furthermore the successful integration and consolidation of any acquisition requires significant human financial and other resources which may distract the attention of ienova’s management from ienova’s existing projects give rise to disruptions in such projects or result in an acquisition not being adequately integrated ienova may be unsuccessful at integrating either of these businesses with its own or may experience difficulties in connection with the integration of their operations and systems including it accounting financial control risk management and safety systems any failure by ienova to achieve the expected results synergies andor economies of scale from the integration of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on ienova’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

other risks 

sempra energy has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control 

sempra energy makes investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control as described above sdge holds a 20 percent ownership interest in songs which is in the process of being decommissioned by edison its majority owner sempra lng  midstream  accounts for its investment in the cameron lng jv under the equity method which investment is approximately 1 billion  at december 31 2016  at december 31 2016  sempra renewables had investments totaling 844 million  in several joint ventures to operate renewable generation facilities sempra mexico has a 40percent interest in a joint venture with a subsidiary of transcanada corporation to build own and operate the sur de texastuxpan  natural gas marine pipeline in mexico a 50 percent interest in a renewables wind project in baja california and a 50percent interest in a joint venture with pemex which in turn owns a 50percent interest in the los ramones norte pipeline in mexico at december 31 2016  these various joint venture investments by sempra mexico totaled 180 million  sempra energy has an investment balance of 67 million  at december 31 2016  that reflects remaining distributions expected to be received from the rbs sempra commodities llp rbs sempra commodities partnership as it is dissolved the timing and amount of distributions may be impacted by the matters we discuss related to rbs sempra commodities in notes 6 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report the failure to collect all or a substantial portion of our remaining investment in the rbs sempra commodities partnership could have a corresponding impact on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations

we have limited influence over these ventures and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest in addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we discuss our investments further in notes 3 4 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

market performance or changes in other assumptions could require sempra energy sdge andor socalgas to make significant unplanned contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees a decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans in addition the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors including the assumed rate of return on plan assets employee demographics discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations rates of increase in health care costs levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation an adverse change in any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

impairment of goodwill would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

as of december 31 2016 sempra energy had approximately 24 billion  of goodwill which represented approximately 49 percent  of the total assets on its consolidated balance sheet primarily related to investments in gasoductos de chihuahua in mexico chilquinta energía in chile and luz del sur in peru goodwill is not amortized but we test it for impairment annually on october 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation which could result in our recording a goodwill impairment loss we discuss our annual goodwill impairment testing process and the factors considered in such testing in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies and estimates ” and in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report a goodwill impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which such charge is recorded

government regulation 

 

 

california state utility regulation 

 

the california utilities are regulated by the california public utilities commission cpuc the california energy commission cec and the california air resources board carb 

 

the california public utilities commission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cpuc also oversees and regulates new products and services including solar and wind energy bioenergy and other forms of renewable energy in addition the cpuc’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety violations 

 

we provide further discussion in notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge is also subject to regulation by the cec which publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based on these forecasts the cec 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the california utilities’ longterm investment decisions 

 

the state of california requires certain california electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver a percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the renewables portfolio standard rps program in december 2011 california senate bill 21x 33 rps program went into effect the 33 rps program requires each electric utility within the state of california to procure 33 percent of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2020 with an average 20 percent required over the threeyear period from january 1 2011 through december 31 2013 25 percent by december 31 2016 and 33 percent by december 31 2020 in october 2015 california senate bill 350 was signed into law requiring each electric utility within the state of california to procure 50 percent of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2030 with interim targets of 40 percent by the end of 2024 and 45 percent by the end of 2027 we discuss this requirement as it applies to sdge in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

certification of a generation project by the cec as an eligible renewable energy resource err allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements if such purchase meets the provisions of california senate bill 21x this may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by sempra renewables and sempra mexico particularly from california utilities sempra renewables’ copper mountain solar 1 facility in nevada is certified as an err sempra renewables has 50percent interests in the copper mountain solar 2 copper mountain solar 3 and mesquite solar 1 facilities as well as four solar facilities that comprise a california solar partnership with our joint venture partner all of which have err certification sempra renewables has received precertification for the mesquite solar 2 mesquite solar 3 and copper mountain solar 4 facilities and is submitting applications for err certification of each phase of the projects as they begin operations we plan to obtain err certification for all of our renewable facilities operating in andor providing power to california as they become operational 

 

california   assembly bill ab 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 assigns responsibility to carb for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions the bill requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a department within the california environmental protection agency an organization that reports directly to the governor’s office in the executive branch of california state government sempra natural gas and sempra mexico are also subject to the rules and regulations of carb we provide further discussion in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

we describe other regulatory matters in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

  

california natural gas utility operations 

 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers and sdge’s core customers on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others we discuss the california utilities’ resource planning natural gas procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters below we also provide further discussion in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

customers 

 

at december 31 2015 socalgas had approximately 59 million customer meters consisting of approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2015 sdge had approximately 873000 natural gas customer meters consisting of approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial and industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers socalgas’ wholesale customers are primarily other ious including sdge or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers 

 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the california utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements 

 

in 2015 socalgas added approximately 33000 new connected natural gas customer meters representing an annual growth rate of 06 percent in 2014 it added approximately 26000 new connected meters representing an annual growth rate of 04 percent sdge’s connected natural gas customer meters increased by approximately 5000 in 2015 representing an annual growth rate of 06 percent in 2014 it added nearly 3000 new connected meters representing an annual growth rate of 04 percent based on forecasts of new housing starts socalgas and sdge each expect that their new meter annual growth rates in 2016 will be slightly higher than those achieved in 2015 

 

 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

 

socalgas   purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the california utilities’ core customers socalgas purchases natural gas from canada the us rockies and the southwestern us to meet its and sdge’s core customer requirements and maintain supply reliability it also purchases some california natural gas production and additional supplies delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

 

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has entered into firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights these contracts expire on various dates between 2016 and 2031 pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company pacific gas and electric company pge and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california the ferc regulates the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services 

 

 

natural gas storage 

 

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers the california utilities’ core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas’ storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others including sdge for its noncore customer requirements through an open bid process the storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to purchase and store natural gas when natural gas costs are low usually during the summer thereby reducing purchases when natural gas costs are expected to be higher this program allows customers to better manage their natural gas procurement and transportation needs 

 

socalgas owns four natural gas storage facilities the facilities have a combined working gas capacity of 137 billion cubic feet bcf and have over 200 injection withdrawal and observation wells natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for ensuring service reliability during peak demand periods including heating needs in the winter as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility represents 63 percent of socalgas’ owned natural gas storage capacity socalgas discovered a natural gas leak at the aliso canyon facility in october 2015 which was permanently sealed in february 2016 as we discuss in “risk factors” below and in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report scaqmd has ordered socalgas to stop all injections at aliso canyon subject to contrary cpuc reliabilitybased direction the cpuc has directed socalgas to maintain a minimum of 15 bcf of working natural gas to help ensure reliability of the system through the spring and summer months and based upon the carb estimates of lost gas the facility is approximately at this level as a result socalgas is no longer withdrawing gas from this facility now that the well has been permanently sealed socalgas will conduct measurements to estimate the actual natural gas lost from the leak and will provide that information to the relevant regulatory bodies 

 

 

demand for natural gas 

 

growth in the demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products environmental regulations renewable energy generation legislation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs other external factors such as weather the price of electricity the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas outside the state of california and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price which may in turn impact demand 

 

the california utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on customers’ preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products in the noncore industrial market some customers are capable of securing alternate fuel supplies from other suppliers which can affect the demand for natural gas the california utilities’ ability to maintain their respective industrial market shares is largely dependent on the relative price spread between delivered natural gas and potential fuel alternatives 

 

natural gasfired electric generation within southern california and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants competes with electric power generated throughout the western united states natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the growth in renewable generation including rooftop solar the addition of more efficient gas technologies new energy efficiency initiatives and the extent that regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the california utilities’ respective service areas the demand may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to climate change weather conditions and other impacts and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources we provide additional information regarding the electric industry and related infrastructure projects and regulatory impacts at the california utilities in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and cash provided from operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry socalgas injects natural gas into storage during the summer months usually april through october which reduces cash provided from operating activities during this period for withdrawal from storage during the winter months usually november through march which increases cash provided from operating activities when customer demand is higher scaqmd has issued a temporary moratorium to socalgas prohibiting the injection of natural gas into the aliso canyon storage facility as we discuss in risk factors below 

 

 

electric utility operations 

 

 

sdge

the supply of electric power available to sdge for resale is based on cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts currently in place with various suppliers sdge’s wholly owned generating facilities and purchases on a spot basis this supply as of december 31 2015 is as follows 

 

 

charges under most of the contracts with qfs are based on sdge’s avoided cost charges under the remaining contracts are for firm and asgenerated energy and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity the prices under these contracts are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated 

 

 

natural gas supply 

 

sdge buys natural gas under shortterm contracts for its palomar desert star miramar and cuyamaca peak generating facilities and for the otay mesa energy center llc orange grove energy lp el cajon energy llc escondido energy center llc and goal line lp tolling contracts purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices sdge’s natural gas is typically delivered from southern california border receipt points to the socal citygate pool via backbone transmission system rights which expire on september 30 2017 the natural gas is then delivered to the generating facilities through socalgas’ and sdge’s pipeline systems in accordance with a transportation agreement that expires on may 31 2017 sdge has also contracted with socalgas for natural gas storage through march 31 2016 this is a yeartoyear contract with a term of april through march that is renegotiated annually 

 

 

power pool 

 

sdge is a participant in the western systems power pool which includes an electricpower and transmissionrate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities power agencies energy brokers and power marketers located throughout the united states and canada participants are able to make power transactions on standardized terms including marketbased rates preapproved by the ferc participation in the western systems power pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk 

 

 

transmission system and access 

 

sdge’s 500kilovolt kv southwest powerlink transmission line which is shared with arizona public service company and imperial irrigation district extends from palo verde arizona to san diego california sdge’s share of the line is 1162 megawatts mw although it can be less under certain system conditions 

 

sdge’s sunrise powerlink is a 500kv transmission line constructed and operated by sdge with import capability of 1000 mw of power it provides transmission capability into sdge’s service territory for renewable energy generated at various renewable energy generation facilities located in the imperial valley region of southern california we provide further discussion of sunrise powerlink in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

mexico’s baja california system is connected to sdge’s system via two 230kv interconnections with combined capacity up to 408 mw in the northtosouth direction and 800 mw in the southtonorth direction although it can be less under certain system conditions

in chile customers are classified as regulated and nonregulated customers based on installed capacity regulated customers are those whose installed capacity is less than 500 kilowatts kw nonregulated customers are those whose installed capacity is greater than 2000 kw customers with installed capacity between 500 kw and 2000 kw may choose to be classified as regulated or nonregulated nonregulated customers can buy power from other sources such as directly from the generator 

 

in 2015 chilquinta energía added approximately 15000 new customer meters at a growth rate of 23 percent chilquinta energía’s electric energy sales decreased by approximately 57000 megawatt hours mwh and increased by approximately 88000 mwh in 2015 and 2014 respectively representing a decline in annual growth rate of 19 percent in 2015 and an increase of 3 percent in 2014 the decrease in electric energy sales in 2015 is primarily due to the transfer of certain nonregulated customers from chilquinta energía to the energyservices company tecnored sa a subsidiary of sempra south american utilities in chile 

 

 

electric resources 

 

the supply of electric power available to chilquinta energía comes from purchasedpower contracts currently in place with its various suppliers and its suppliers’ generating facilities this supply as of december 31 2015 was as follows 

 

 

 

 

power generation system 

 

the centers for economic load dispatch centros de despacho económico de carga or cdec are private organizations in charge of coordinating the operation of the electricity system each interconnected system is subject to its own cdec there is a cdecsic sistema interconectado central central interconnected system and cdecsing sistema interconectado del norte grande northern interconnected system for the central and the northern interconnected system respectively chilquinta energía operates within cdecsic 

 

 

transmission system and access 

 

transmission lines in chile are either part of its main transmission system sistema de transmisión troncal or its subtransmission system sistema de subtransmisión in chile main transmission lines must be greater than or equal to 220 kv chilquinta energía primarily uses transelec a third party for its main transmission in general subtransmission systems operate at voltage levels greater than 23 kv and lower than or equal to 220 kv subtransmission systems including those owned by chilquinta energía are comprised of infrastructure that is interconnected to the electricity system to supply nonregulated and regulated endusers located in the distribution service area 

 

we discuss transmission line projects that were completed in 2015 or are ongoing at chilquinta energía’s joint ventures in the “our business” and “factors influencing future performance” sections of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

 

luz del sur 

 

customers 

 

luz del sur has approximately 1053000 customer meters in the southern zone of metropolitan lima peru with a main service area covering approximately 1394 square miles at december 31 2015 its customer meters consisted of approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in peru customers are classified as regulated and nonregulated customers based on capacity demand regulated customers are those whose capacity demand is less than 200 kw and their energy supply is considered public service nonregulated customers are those whose capacity demand is greater than 2500 kw customers with capacity demand between 200 kw and 2500 kw may choose to be classified as regulated or nonregulated 

 

in 2015 luz del sur added approximately 24000 new customer meters at a growth rate of 23 percent luz del sur’s electric energy sales increased by approximately 262000 mwh and 303000 mwh in 2015 and 2014 respectively representing annual growth rates of 36 percent in 2015 and 4 percent in 2014 

 

 

electric resources 

 

the supply of electric power available to luz del sur comes from purchasedpower contracts currently in place with various suppliers as well as purchases made on an asneeded basis starting in september 2015 luz del sur also began using the supply of power generated by santa teresa its wholly owned 100mw hydroelectric power plant in peru’s cusco region 

 

luz del sur’s electric power supply as of december 31 2015 was as follows 

 

 

 

  

  

power generation system 

 

the sistema eléctrico interconectado nacional sein is the peruvian national interconnected system peru also has several isolated regional and smaller systems that provide electricity to specific areas the osinergmin in addition to setting tariffs as discussed above controls and enforces compliance with legal and technical regulations related to electric activities and supervises the bidding processes required by distribution companies to purchase energy from generators 

 

the   committee of economic operation of the national interconnected system comité de operación económica del sistema interconectado nacional or   coes coordinates the operation and dispatch of electricity of the sein and manages the shortterm market the coes oversees generation transmission and distribution companies as well as unregulated customers with a demand higher than 200 kw 

 

 

transmission system and access 

 

transmission lines in peru are divided into principal and secondary systems the principal system lines are accessible by all generators and allow the flow of energy through the national grid the secondary system lines connect principal transmission with the network of distribution companies or connect directly to certain final customers the transmission company receives tariff revenues and collects tolls based on a charge per unit of electricity 

 

we discuss ongoing transmission line and substation projects at luz del sur in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” in the annual report 

 

 

rates and regulation – utilities 

 

we provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to our utilities in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

sempra international and sempra us gas  power 

 

sempra international and sempra us gas  power contain most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to california utility regulation in addition to the discussion of our south american utilities above we provide descriptions of these operating units’ segments and information concerning their operations in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 3 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

competition 

 

sempra energy’s nonutility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar services they are engaged in highly competitive activities that require significant capital investments and highly skilled and experienced personnel among these competitors there may be significant variation in financial personnel and other resources compared to sempra international and sempra us gas  power 

 

generation – renewables 

 

sempra renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity through its development of and investments in wind and solar generation facilities sempra renewables will compete with other nonutility generators regulated utilities unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy service companies for sales of noncontracted renewable energy when its copper mountain solar 4 facility is placed in service in 2016 until a 20year power sales agreement with edison begins in 2020 the number and type of competitors may vary based on location generation type and project size also regulatory initiatives designed to enhance energy consumption from renewable resources for regulated utility companies may increase competition from these types of institutions these utilities may have a lower cost of capital than most independent renewable power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms this allows them to build buy and upgrade renewable generation projects without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments additionally generation from sempra renewables’ renewable energy assets is exposed to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind inclement weather and hours of sunlight 

 

our renewable energy competitors include among others 

 

 

because sempra mexico sells the power that it generates at its energía sierra juárez wind project into california it is also impacted by these competitive factors 

 

natural gas pipelines and storage facilities 

 

within its market area sempra natural gas’ and sempra mexico’s pipelines businesses and sempra natural gas’ storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines they compete primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets 

 

sempra natural gas’ competitors include among others 

 

 

sempra mexico’s natural gas pipeline competitors include among others 

 

 

lng 

 

technological advances associated with shale gas and tight oil production have eliminated the need for north american lng import facilities and increased interest in liquefaction and export opportunities 

 

at current forward gas prices us gulf coast liquefaction is among the most price competitive potential lng supply in the world brownfield liquefaction is particularly price competitive resulting from many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

global lng competition primarily from canada russia east africa and australia may limit us lng exports as international liquefaction projects attempt to match us gulf coast lng production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility host governments for international liquefaction projects are altering fiscal and tax regimes in an effort to make projects in their jurisdictions competitive relative to us projects however sustained low oil prices may cause some of the international projects to become unfeasible due to their lng price formulas’ link to oil prices it is expected that us lng exports will increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand and thereby facilitate development of a global commodity market for natural gas 

 

sempra natural gas has a 502percent equity interest in cameron lng jv which owns a regasification facility in hackberry louisiana the joint venture began construction in the second half of 2014 on a natural gas liquefaction export facility using some of the existing regasification infrastructure the joint venture has authorization to export lng to both free trade agreement fta countries and to countries that do not have an fta with the united states 

 

cameron lng jv has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with engie sa and affiliates of mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd which subscribe the full nameplate capacity of three trains at the facility in addition cameron lng jv is working on the development of up to two additional trains these projects would compete against other global projects we discuss cameron lng jv in notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” in the annual report our joint venture partners affiliates of engie sa mitsubishi corporation through a related company jointly established with nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha nyk and mitsui  co ltd compete globally to market and sell lng to end users including gas and electric utilities located in lng importing countries around the world by providing liquefaction services cameron lng jv will compete indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global lng market in addition to the us these competitors are located in the middle east southeast asia africa south america australia and europe 

 

sempra energy is also taking steps to develop additional lng export facilities at sempra natural gas’ port arthur texas property and sempra mexico’s energía costa azul regasification facility 

 

our lng liquefaction business’ major domestic and international competitors will include among others the following companies and their related lng affiliates 

 

 

  

 

environmental matters 

 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions 

 

 

hazardous substances 

 

the cpuc’s hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allows california’s ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the california utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the california utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates 

 

at december 31 2015 we had accrued estimated remaining investigation and remediation liabilities of 2 million at sdge and 25 million at socalgas both related to hazardous waste sites for which the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism applies as described above the accruals include costs for numerous locations most of which had been manufacturedgas plants at socalgas we believe that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial condition of sempra energy sdge or socalgas 

 

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets 

 

 

air and water quality 

 

the electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent airquality and greenhouse gas standards such as those established by the united states environmental protection agency epa the carb and scaqmd the california utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards we discuss greenhouse gas standards and credits further in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other owners of songs have an agreement with the california coastal commission ccc to mitigate environmental impacts to the marine environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs during its operation songs’ early retirement described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report does not reduce sdge’s mitigation obligation sdge’s share of the mitigation costs is estimated to be 57 million of which 43 million had been incurred through december 31 2015 and 14 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050 artificial kelp reef fish hatchery and wetlands restoration projects are complete but continue to be studied until the ccc accepts the projects the remaining costs are to meet ccc acceptance requirements and maintain the projects through 2050

 item 1a risk factors 

 

when evaluating our company and its subsidiaries you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report these risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf we may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of the following occurs our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially negatively impacted in addition the trading prices of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning   our company set forth in the annual report including without limitation the information set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this section when we state that a risk or uncertainty may could or will have a “material adverse effect” on us or may could or will “materially adversely affect” us we mean that the risk or uncertainty may could or will as the case may be have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition prospects andor the trading prices of our securities or those of our subsidiaries 

 

sempra energy’s cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and the ability to utilize the cash flows from those subsidiaries 

 

sempra energy’s ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own expenditures preferred stock dividends if any and longterm debt obligations in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including without limitation as a result of legislation regulation court order contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress 

 

a significant portion of our worldwide cash reserves are generated by and therefore held in foreign jurisdictions some jurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the united states or impose taxes on such transfers of cash which reduces the cash available to us in addition we may be required to pay us income taxes on earnings that are not repatriated if legislation being discussed on this matter is passed   to the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in or is needed by our united states operations we may incur significant us and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds 

 

conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us 

 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and refund outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations 

 

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments in difficult credit market environments we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support new business activities this could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of servicing debt both of which could significantly reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability 

 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings if the credit ratings of socalgas or sdge were to be reduced their cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and any reduction in sempra energy’s credit ratings could materially adversely affect the cash flows and results of operations of sempra energy and its regulated utility subsidiaries located outside of california if the credit ratings of sempra energy or any of its subsidiaries were to decline especially below investment grade financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require collateral in the form of cash a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

 

sempra energy has substantial investments in mexico and south america which expose us to foreign currency inflation legal tax economic geopolitical and management oversight risk 

 

we have foreign operations in mexico and south america our for eign operations pose complex management foreign currency legal tax and economic risks which we may not be able to fully mitigate with our actions these risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic businesses all of our international businesses are sensitive to geopolitical uncertainties and our nonutility international businesses are sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers all of which may be driven by changes in threat environments and potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions and various regional and local economic and political factors risks and uncertainties as well as us foreign policy foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our revenue costs or cash flows from our international operations which could materially adversely affect our financial performance our primary currency exposures are to the mexican peruvian and chilean currencies our primary objective in reducing foreign currency risk is to preserve the economic value of our foreign investments and to reduce earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations we may attempt to offset material crosscurrency transactions and earnings exposure through various means including financial instruments and shortterm investments because we generally do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries we are susceptible to volatility in other comprehensive income caused by exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to our south american subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar we discuss our foreign currency exposure at our mexican subsidiaries in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under “results of operations – changes in revenues costs and earnings – income taxes – foreign currency exchange rate and inflation impact on income taxes and related economic hedging activity” and “factors influencing future performance – market risk – foreign currency rate risk” in the annual report 

 

 

risks related to all sempra energy subsidiaries 

 

severe weather conditions natural disasters catastrophic accidents major equipment failures or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by severe weather conditions natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis and fires catastrophic accidents major equipment failures or acts of terrorism because we are in the business of using storing transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials as well as radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure as well as the risks to the surrounding communities are substantially greater than the risks such incidents may pose to a typical business the facilities and infrastructure that we own and in which we have interests that may be subject to such incidents include but are not limited to 

 

 

such incidents could result in severe business disruptions property damage injuries or loss of life significant decreases in revenues and earnings andor significant additional costs to us any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires natural gas odorant propane or ethane leaks radioactive releases explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties personal injuries health impacts or fatalities or present a nuisance to impacted communities any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us in some cases we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault and in cases where the concept of inverse condemnation applies we may be liable for damages without being found to be at fault or to have been negligent insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become unavailable for certain of these risks and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to the existence of limitations exclusions high deductibles failure to comply with procedural requirements and other factors which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

severe weather conditions may also impact our businesses including our international operations on january 17 2014 the governor of california declared a state of emergency because of severe drought conditions in the state the drought conditions in california and the western united states increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories which could place third party property and our electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy the drought conditions also reduce the amount of power available from hydroelectric generation facilities in the northwest united states which could adversely impact the availability of a reliable energy supply into the california electric grid managed by the california iso if alternate supplies of electric generation are not available to replace the lower level of power available from hydroelectric generation facilities this could result in temporary power shortages in sdge’s service territory 

 

another example of weather impacting operations is a strong el ni ñ o weather pattern in the pacific ocean which has caused severe rainstorms in southern california during the winter in late 2015 and early 2016 and could continue beyond that timeframe significant rainstorms and associated high winds such as those caused by a strong el ni ñ o weather pattern could damage our electric and natural gas infrastructure resulting in increased expenses including higher maintenance and repair costs and interruptions in electricity and natural gas delivery services as a result these events can have significant financial consequences including regulatory penalties and disallowances if the california utilities or our utilities in mexico south america alabama and mississippi encounter difficulties in restoring service to their customers on a timely basis further the cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process any such events could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation 

 

in recent years the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on the federal state and local levels these changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses moreover existing regulations laws and tariffs may be revised or reinterpreted and new regulations laws and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities special tariffs may also be imposed on components used in our businesses that could increase costs 

 

our businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements and the regulations laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs and new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations in the us and other countries in which we operate could materially adversely affect our tax expense andor tax balances changes in regulations laws and tariffs and how they are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the california utilities and other sempra energy businesses these rules are commonly referred to as “affiliate rules” which primarily impact commodity and commodityrelated transactions these businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or to their interpretations or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas to or to trade with the california utilities and with each other affiliate rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the california utilities any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the lng terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or other operations of our subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor prospects 

 

our businesses require numerous permits licenses franchise agreements and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies any failure to obtain or maintain required permits licenses or approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

all of our existing and planned development projects require multiple approvals the acquisition construction ownership and operation of lng terminals natural gas pipelines and distribution and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution facilities and propane and ethane systems require numerous permits licenses franchise agreements certificates and other approvals from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies once received approvals may be subject to litigation and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed or modified in litigation in addition permits licenses franchise agreements certificates and other approvals may be modified rescinded or fail to be extended by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses socalgas’ franchise agreements for the city of los angeles and los angeles county where the aliso canyon facility is located are due to expire in 2016 and 2017 respectively if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or failure to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities or we may be forced to incur additional costs further accidents beyond our control may cause us to violate the terms of conditional use permits causing delays in projects any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain necessary permits licenses certificates and other approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations and mandates relating to environmental protection including air quality water quality and usage wastewater discharge solid waste management hazardous waste disposal and remediation conservation of natural resources wetlands and wildlife renewable energy resources climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees the california utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs for projects are not recoverable in rates in addition we may be ultimately responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our lng terminals natural gas transmission distribution and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution facilities and other energy projects and properties regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown in the case of our california and other regulated utilities some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates our facilities including those in our joint ventures are subject to laws and regulations protecting migratory birds which have recently been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to wind farms failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines andor significant curtailments of our operations which could materially adversely affect our cash flows andor results of operations 

 

the scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations including their effects on our current operations and future expansions are difficult to predict increasing international national regional and statelevel concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed state national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions including carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations the implementation of recent and proposed california and federal legislation and regulation may materially adversely affect our nonutility businesses by imposing among other things additional costs associated with emission limits controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits similarly our california and other regulated utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates even if recoverable the effects of existing and proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth and may have a material adverse effect on the california utilities’ cash flows sdge may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

 

in addition existing and future laws orders and regulations regarding mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates methane or other emissions could result in requirements for additional monitoring pollution monitoring and control equipment safety practices or emission fees taxes or penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows 

 

we provide further discussion of these matters in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation against us 

 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and arbitration proceedings we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and proceedings and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings we discuss pending proceedings in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report the uncertainties inherent in lawsuits arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part in rates from our customers which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations andor financial condition 

 

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices in addition for those contract positions that are hedged our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned 

 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

 

in addition possible changes in federal regulation of overthecounter derivatives regulated by the us commodity futures trading commission could impact the cost and effectiveness of our hedging programs as we discuss in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance – other sempra energy matters” in the annual report certain of the contracts we use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts in certain cases these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged 

 

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

 

although we have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by our businesses or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

 

the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees 

 

several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a companybycompany basis any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

 

new business technologies implemented by us or developed by others present a risk for increased attacks on our information systems and the integrity of our energy grid and our natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure 

 

cybersecurity and the protection of our operations and other activities including our customer and employee information are a priority at sempra energy sdge and socalgas in addition to general information and cyber risks that all fortune 500 corporations face eg malware malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information smart grid infrastructure and natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure deployment of new business technologies represents a new and largescale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer information as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure while our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malware unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks to date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across sempra energy’s businesses but we cannot ensure that a successful attack will not occur an attack on our information systems the integrity of the energy grid our natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure or one of our facilities or unauthorized access to confidential customer information could result in energy delivery service failures financial loss violations of privacy laws customer dissatisfaction and litigation any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

in the ordinary course of business sempra energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees customer energy usage and other information the theft damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws subject us to claims from third parties require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations and harm our reputation 

 

finally as seen with recent cyberattacks around the world the goal of a cyberattack may be primarily to inflict largescale harm on a company and the places where it operates any such cyberattack could cause widespread disruptions to our operating and administrative systems including the destruction of critical information and programming that could materially adversely affect our business operations and the integrity of the power grid andor release confidential information about our company and our customers employees and other constituents 

 

our businesses will need to continue to adapt to technological change which may cause us to incur significant expenditures to adapt to these changes and which efforts may not be successful 

 

we expect that emerging technologies may be superior to or may not be compatible with some of our existing technologies investments and infrastructure and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive or may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets or the operating assets of our equity method investments our future success will depend in part on our ability and our investment partners’ abilities to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets if we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological changes fail to adapt to significant technological changes fail to obtain access to important new technologies or fail to recover a significant portion of any remaining investment in obsolete assets our businesses operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected examples of technological changes that could negatively impact our businesses include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risks related to the california utilities 

 

the california utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may materially adversely affect us 

 

the cpuc regulates the california utilities’ rates except sdge’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates the california utilities’ 

 

 

the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance safety standards and practices compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows socalgas and sdge may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines and storage and for sdge electric operations under regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety and citation programs concerning both gas and electric safety which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the california utilities’ rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

the cpuc periodically approves the california utilities’ rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs including income taxes and an authorized rate of return on investment delays by the cpuc on decisions authorizing recovery or authorizations for less than full recovery may adversely affect the working capital and financial condition of each of the california utilities if the california utilities receive an adverse cpuc decision andor actual capital expenditures andor operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the cpuc our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected reductions in key benchmark interest rates may trigger automatic adjustment mechanisms which would reduce the california utilities’ authorized rates of return changes in which could materially adversely affect their results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

 

the cpuc applies performancebased measures and mechanisms to all california utilities under these earnings potential over authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals and reductions in authorized base margins are tied to not achieving specific performance and operating goals at both of the california utilities the areas that are currently eligible for performance mechanisms are operational activities designated by the cpuc and energy efficiency programs at sdge electric reliability performance and at socalgas natural gas procurement and unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services although the california utilities have received incentive awards in the past there can be no assurance that they will receive awards in the future or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods additionally if the california utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets and other similar matters involving sdge 

 

the california utilities may be materially adversely affected by new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies in addition existing legislation or regulations may be revised or reinterpreted new revised or reinterpreted legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how the california utilities operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses 

 

the construction and expansion of the california utilities’ natural gas pipelines socalgas’ storage facilities and sdge’s electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits licenses and other approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies if there are delays in obtaining these approvals or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the california utilities’ businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially adversely affected coordinating these projects so that they are on time and within budget requires good execution from our employees and contractors cooperation of third parties and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay in the event that one or more of these major projects is delayed or experiences significant cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on the california utilities the california utilities may invest a significant amount of money in a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if the project does not receive regulatory approval if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes or if management decides not to proceed with the project they may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project which could materially adversely affect their financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

our california utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as the utility reform network turn utility consumers’ action network ucan sierra club and other stakeholder and advocacy groups operations that may be influenced by these groups include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

socalgas will incur significant costs and expenses to remediate the natural gas leak at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility and to mitigate local community and environmental impacts from the leak some or a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance and socalgas also may incur significant liabilities for fines penalties damages and greenhouse gas mitigation activities as a result of this incident some or a significant portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance 

 

in october 2015 socalgas discovered a leak at one of its injection and withdrawal wells ss25 at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility located in the northern part of the san fernando valley in los angeles county the aliso canyon facility which has been operated by socalgas since 1972 is situated in the santa susana mountains ss25 is more than one mile away from and 1200 feet above the closest homes it is one of more than 100 injection and withdrawal wells at the storage facility 

 

stopping the leak and mitigation efforts 

 

socalgas worked closely with several of the worlds leading experts to stop the leak including planning and obtaining all necessary approvals for drilling relief wells after discovering the leak socalgas made seven unsuccessful attempts to plug ss25 by pumping fluids down the well shaft in early december 2015 socalgas began drilling a relief well designed to stop the leak by plugging the well at its base on february 11 2016 socalgas began pumping heavy fluids through the relief well into ss25 near the base of the well which controlled the flow of natural gas through the well and stopped the leak in order to permanently seal the well and consistent with directives from the doggr and cpuc socalgas then injected cement into ss25 at its base and on february 18 2016 the doggr confirmed that the well was permanently sealed 

 

pursuant to a stipulation and order and in response to claims made pursuant to lawsuits described below socalgas has been providing temporary relocation support to residents in the nearby community who request it in addition socalgas has been providing air filtration and purification systems to those residents in the nearby community requesting them as a result of receiving the confirmation from doggr that the ss25 well was permanently sealed socalgas started winding down its temporary relocation support subject to certain exceptions the period for temporary relocation support to residents who temporarily relocated to shortterm housing such as hotels concluded on february 25 2016 this deadline has been challenged and is subject to a recent court order extending such period for an additional 22 days for certain residents socalgas has appealed this order extending the support period additionally residents who have been placed in rental housing will have through the agreed term of their leases to return home in addition socalgas also intends to mitigate the ghg emissions from the actual natural gas released 

 

the total costs incurred to remediate and stop the leak and to mitigate environmental and local community impacts will be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

governmental investigations and civil and criminal litigation 

 

various governmental agencies including the doggr los angeles county department of public health scaqmd carb cpuc epa los angeles district attorney’s office and california attorney general’s office are investigating this incident socalgas has been working in close cooperation with these agencies 

 

as of february 24 2016 83 lawsuits have been filed against socalgas some of which have also named sempra energy and in derivative claims on behalf of sempra energy and socalgas certain officers and directors of sempra energy and socalgas these various lawsuits assert causes of action for negligence strict liability property damage fraud nuisance trespass and breach of fiduciary duties among other things and additional litigation may be filed against us in the future related to this incident many of these complaints seek class action status compensatory and punitive damages injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees the los angeles city attorney and los angeles county counsel have also filed a complaint on behalf of the people of the state of california against socalgas for public nuisance and violation of the california unfair competition law the california attorney general acting in her independent capacity and on behalf of the people of the state of california and the carb joined this lawsuit the complaint as amended to include the california attorney general adds allegations of violations of california health and safety code sections 41700 prohibiting discharge of air contaminants that cause annoyance to the public and 25510 requiring reporting of the release of hazardous material as well as california government code section 12607 for equitable relief for the protection of natural resources the complaint seeks an order for injunctive relief to abate the public nuisance and to impose civil penalties the scaqmd also filed a complaint against socalgas seeking civil penalties for alleged violations of several nuisancerelated statutory provisions arising from the leak and delays in stopping the leak that suit seeks up to 250000 in civil penalties for each day the violations occurred 

 

on february 2 2016 the los angeles district attorney’s office filed a misdemeanor criminal complaint against socalgas seeking penalties for alleged failure to provide timely notice of the leak pursuant to california health and safety code section 25510a los angeles county code section 1256030 and title 19 california code of regulations section 2703a and for violating california health and safety code section 41700 prohibiting discharge of air contaminants that cause annoyance to the public 

 

the costs of defending against these civil and criminal lawsuits and cooperating with these investigations and any damages and civil and criminal fines and other penalties if awarded or imposed could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance or if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

governmental orders additional regulation and reliability 

 

on january 6 2016 the governor of the state of california issued an order the governor’s order proclaiming a state of emergency to exist in los angeles county due to the natural gas leak at the aliso canyon facility the governor’s order implements various orders with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide further detail regarding the governor’s order in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

on january 23 2016 the hearing board of the scaqmd ordered socalgas to among other things stop the leak control the release of natural gas into the air and conduct air monitoring and public health studies we provide further detail regarding the scaqmd’s order in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

on january 25 2016 the doggr and cpuc selected blade energy partners to conduct an independent analysis under their supervision and to be funded by socalgas to investigate the technical root cause of the aliso canyon leak in addition effective february 5 2016 the doggr amended the california code of regulations to require all underground natural gas storage facility operators including socalgas to take further steps to help ensure the safety of their gas storage operations additional hearings in the state legislature as well as with various other regulatory agencies have been or are expected to be scheduled additional legislation has been proposed in the state legislature and additional laws orders rules and regulations may be adopted 

 

the costs to comply with the various laws orders rules and regulations arising out of this incident could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance or in customer rates such costs could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for ensuring service reliability during peak demand periods including heating needs in the winter as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer aliso canyon with a storage capacity of 86 bcf is the largest storage facility and an important element of socalgas’ delivery system serving millions of homes and businesses across southern california aliso canyon represents 63 percent of socalgas’ owned natural gas storage capacity socalgas has not injected natural gas into aliso canyon since october 25 2015 and in accordance with the governor’s order and subject to contrary cpuc reliabilitybased direction socalgas will continue this moratorium on further injections until the completion of a review utilizing independent experts of the safety of each of the storage wells and air quality in the surrounding communities and an evaluation by an independent panel of scientific and medical experts on whether additional measures are needed to protect public health we are also currently reviewing the recently released doggr safety review requirements associated with returning aliso canyon to an active injectionwithdrawal status if this facility were to be taken out of service for any meaningful period of time it could result in an impairment of the aliso canyon facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs andor additional capital expenditures and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized at december 31 2015 the aliso canyon facility has a net book value of 243 million excluding 162 million of construction work in progress for the project to construct a new compression station any significant impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on socalgas’ and sempra energy’s results of operations for the period in which it is recorded higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas may not be recoverable in customer rates which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 

insurance 

 

we have at least four kinds of insurance policies that provide in excess of 1 billion in insurance coverage we have been communicating with our insurance carriers and intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage these policies are subject to various policy limits exclusions and conditions there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining insurance coverage for costs related to the leak under the applicable policies and to the extent we are not successful it could result in a material charge against earnings 

 

we discuss this matter further in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “capital resources and liquidity” and “factors influencing future performance” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

natural gas pipeline safety assessments may not be fully or adequately recovered in rates 

 

pending the outcome of various regulatory agency evaluations of natural gas pipeline safety regulations practices and procedures sempra energy including the california utilities may incur substantial incremental expense and capital investment associated with their natural gas pipeline operations and investments the california utilities filed a comprehensive plan with the cpuc to test or replace natural gas transmission pipelines that either have not been pressure tested or lack sufficient documentation of a pressure test to enhance existing valve infrastructure and to retrofit pipelines to allow for the use of inline inspection technology referred to as socalgas’ and sdge’s pipeline safety enhancement plan psep the california utilities’ total estimated cost for phase i the 10year period from 2012 to 2022 of the twophase psep was 21 billion 16 billion for socalgas and 500 million for sdge these cost estimates may continue to change over time to reflect the development of more detailed estimates actual costs experienced as portions of the work are completed and changes in scope 

 

in june 2014 the cpuc issued a final decision approving the utilities’ model for implementing psep and established the criteria to determine the amounts related to psep that may be recovered from ratepayers and the processes for recovery of such amounts including providing that such costs are subject to a reasonableness review in october 2014 the california utilities filed a petition for modification with the cpuc requesting authority to recover psep costs from customers subject to refund pending the results of a reasonableness review by the cpuc the request is pending at the cpuc 

 

the california utilities filed an application to recover a portion of psep costs that they incurred prior to the cpuc’s june 2014 decision certain consumer advocacy groups recommended that the cpuc disallow a portion of these costs and a cpuc decision in the proceeding remains pending in the future consumer advocacy groups may similarly recommend disallowances with respect to applications to recover psep costs 

 

in december 2015 in response to a request by intervenors for rehearing of the june 2014 psep decision the cpuc adopted a decision finding shareholders responsible for the costs associated with pressure testing or replacing transmission pipelines installed between january 1 1956 and july 1 1961 for which the california utilities do not have a record of a pressure test the cpuc previously determined that because no pressure testing requirements existed prior to 1961 socalgas and sdge could recover the reasonable cost of pressure testing pipelines installed during that timeframe socalgas and sdge filed an application for rehearing of the december 2015 psep decision in january 2016 the december 2015 decision also transfers consideration of socalgas’ and sdge’s pending petition for modification of the june 2014 psep decision and any other interim rate recovery issues to a pending psep phase 2 application proceeding in the phase 2 psep proceeding socalgas and sdge seek authority to proceed with initial planning and engineering work in order to develop detailed cost estimates for phase 2 of psep 

 

if the cpuc were to decide as part of any future reasonableness review or rehearing application that rate recovery not be allowed for psep and other gas pipeline safety costs incurred by socalgas and sdge it could materially adversely affect the respective companys cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

 

we provide additional information in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the california utilities are subject to increasingly stringent safety standards and the potential for significant penalties if regulators deem either sdge or socalgas to be out of compliance 

 

in december 2011 the cpuc adopted a natural gas safety citation program whereby natural gas distribution companies can be cited by cpuc staff for violations of the cpuc’s safety standards in september 2013 the cpuc’s safety and enforcement division issued standard operating procedures setting forth its principles and management process for the natural gas safety citation program 

 

in 2013 the california state senate passed legislation senate bill sb 291 requiring the cpuc to develop and maintain a safety enforcement program that includes procedures for monitoring data tracking and analysis and investigations as well as delegates citation authority to cpuc staff personnel under the direction of the cpuc executive director this legislation required the cpuc to implement the enforcement program for natural gas safety by july 1 2014 and for electric safety by january 1 2015 in exercising this citation authority the cpuc staff is to take into account voluntary reporting of potential violations voluntary resolution efforts undertaken prior history of violations the gravity of the violation and the degree of culpability 

 

in december 2014 the cpuc adopted an electric safety enforcement program whereby electric utilities may be cited by cpuc staff for violations of the cpuc’s safety requirements or applicable federal standards 

 

under the cpuc’s gas and electric enforcement program each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense the maximum penalty is 50000 per offense citations under either program may be appealed to the cpuc penalties imposed under these programs can be significant exceeding 15 billion in one instance the cpuc is currently considering proposed refinements to the electric and gas safety enforcement programs and a decision on these proposals remains pending 

 

as a result of the natural gas leak at the aliso canyon facility the scaqmd filed a complaint against socalgas seeking civil penalties for alleged violations of several nuisancerelated statutory provisions arising from the leak and delays in stopping the leak the suit seeks up to 250000 in civil penalties for each day the violations occurred 

 

if the cpuc or its staff determine that either of sdge’s or socalgas’ operations and practices are not in compliance with applicable safety standards and operating procedures the corrective actions required to be in conformance and any penalties imposed could materially adversely affect that company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

 

meaningful net energy metering or nem reform is necessary to ensure that sdge is authorized to recover its costs in providing services to nem customers while minimizing the cost shift or subsidy being borne by nonsolar customers 

 

due to current rate structures and state policies customers who selfgenerate their own power using eligible renewable resources primarily solar installations currently do not pay their proportionate cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system subject to certain limitations while they still receive power from the system when their selfgeneration is inadequate to meet their electricity needs the proportionate costs not paid by nem customers are paid ie subsidized by consumers not participating in nem in addition the continuing increase of selfgenerated solar other forms of selfgeneration and other local offthegrid sources of power adversely impacts the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system 

 

in july 2014 the cpuc initiated a rulemaking proceeding to develop a successor tariff to the state’s existing nem program pursuant to the provisions of ab 327 which required the cpuc to establish a revised nem tariff or similar program by december 31 2015 the nem program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of onsite renewable generation it was originally established in california in 1995 with the adoption of sb 656 as codified in section 2827 of the public utilities code currently customers who install and operate eligible renewable generation facilities of one megawatt or less may choose to participate in the nem program under nem customergenerators receive a full retail rate for the energy they generate that is fed back to the utility’s power grid this occurs during times when the customer’s generation exceeds their own energy usage in addition if a nem customer generates any electricity over the annual measurement period that exceeds its annual consumption they receive compensation at a rate equal to a wholesale energy price 

 

in august 2015 sdge proposed a successor nem tariff that is intended to ensure that all nem customers pay for the grid and other services they receive supports the continued growth and adoption of distributed energy resources and helps california meet its energy policy goals in january 2016 sdge pge and edison filed a joint recommendation to continue the pursuit of a fair and equitable rate structure for all customers subsequently in january 2016 the cpuc adopted a final decision in the case that makes modest changes now to require nem customers to pay some costs that would otherwise be borne by nonnem customers and moves new nem customers to timeofuse rates together with tiered rate compression discussed under rate reform the nem successor tariff begins a process of reducing the cost burden on nonnem customers the decision also targets the inclusion of fixed charges for nem customers beginning in 2019 which is expected to expand the proportion of costs shared by nem customers 

 

appropriate nem reform is necessary to ensure that sdge is authorized to recover from nem customers the costs incurred in providing grid and energy services as well as mandated legislative and regulatory public policy programs sdge believes this design would be preferable to recovering these costs from customers not participating in nem if nem selfgenerating installations were to increase substantially between 2016 and 2019 when more significant reforms are to take effect the rate structure adopted by the cpuc could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

the failure by the cpuc to continue reforms of sdge’s rate structure including the implementation of a more significant fixed charge could have a material adverse effect on its business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

the current electric rate structure in california is primarily based on consumption volume which places an undue burden on residential customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers as higher electric use residential customers switch to selfgeneration or obtain local offthegrid sources of power such as wind the burden on the remaining higher electric use customers increases which in turn encourages more selfgeneration further increasing rate pressure on existing customers in july 2015 the cpuc adopted a proposed decision that establishes comprehensive reform and a framework for rates that are more transparent fair and sustainable the adopted decision provides for a minimum monthly bill fewer rate tiers and a gradual reduction in the differences between the tiered rates directs the utilities to pursue expanded time of use rates and implements a superuser electric surcharge in 2017 for usage that exceeds average customer usage by approximately 400 percent within each climate zone the surcharge will increase over time ultimately reaching a rate of more than double the first tier rate the adopted decision will be implemented over a five year period from 2015 to 2020 and should result in significant relief for higheruse customers that do not exceed the superuser threshold and a rate structure that better aligns rates with actual costs to serve customers the adopted decision also establishes a process for implementing a fixed charge in 2020 after the initial reforms are implemented the establishment of a fixed charge may become more critical to help ensure rates are fair for all customers as distributed energy resources could generally reduce delivered volumes and increase fixed costs 

 

if the cpuc fails to continue to reform sdge’s rate structure by implementing a rate structure that maintains reasonable costbased electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system such failure could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

recovery of 2007 wildfire litigation costs requires future regulatory approval 

 

sdge is seeking to recover in rates its reasonably incurred costs of resolving 2007 wildfire claims in excess of its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties through december 31 2015 sdge’s payments for claims settlements plus funds estimated to be required for settlement of outstanding claims and legal fees have exceeded its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties however sdge has concluded that it is probable that it will be permitted to recover in rates a substantial portion of the reasonably incurred costs of resolving wildfire claims in excess of its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties at december 31 2015 sempra energy’s and sdge’s consolidated balance sheets included assets of 362 million in other regulatory assets longterm of which 359 million is related to cpucregulated operations and 3 million is related to fercregulated operations for costs incurred and the estimated resolution of pending claims 

 

in december 2012 the cpuc issued a final decision allowing sdge to maintain an authorized memorandum account enabling sdge to file applications with the cpuc requesting recovery of amounts properly recorded in the memorandum account subject to reasonableness review at a later date in september 2015 sdge filed an application with the cpuc requesting rate recovery of an estimated 379 million of such costs sdge requested a cpuc decision by the end of 2016 and is proposing to recover the costs in rates over a six to tenyear period intervening parties have recommended a phased approach with phase 1 addressing the reasonableness of sdge’s actions leading up to the fires and a cpuc decision in the second half of 2017 phase 2 would address the reasonableness of settlements entered into by sdge with a cpuc decision in the second half of 2018 several parties have protested the application on the basis that sdge should be denied cost recovery recovery of these costs in rates will require regulatory approvals if sdge had concluded that the recovery of regulatory assets related to cpucregulated operations was no longer probable or was less than currently estimated at december 31 2015 the resulting aftertax charge against earnings would have been up to approximately 213 million 

 

a failure to obtain substantial or full recovery of these costs from customers or any negative assessment of the likelihood of recovery would likely have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s and sdge’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations in addition if recovery is permitted the collection process will extend over a number of years we discuss how we assess the probability of recovery of our regulatory assets in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility that is being decommissioned 

 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california that is in the process of being decommissioned by edison the majority owner of songs songs is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc and the cpuc on june 6 2013 edison notified sdge that it had reached a decision to permanently retire songs and seek approval from the nrc to start the decommissioning activities for the entire facility sdge and each of the other owners holds its undivided interest as a tenant in common in the property and each owner is responsible for financing its share of expenses and capital expenditures including decommissioning activities although the facility is being decommissioned sdge’s ownership interest in songs continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility which include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition sdge maintains nuclear decommissioning trusts for the purpose of providing funds to decommission songs trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities which are subject to significant market fluctuations a decline in the market value of trust assets or an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts could increase the funding requirements for these trusts which in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates furthermore cpuc approval is required in order to make withdrawals from these trusts cpuc approvals may lag cash expenditures and approval for certain expenditures may be denied by the cpuc altogether if the cpuc determines that the expenditures are unreasonable finally decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore may exceed the amounts in the trust funds recovery for those overruns would require cpuc approval which may not occur 

 

interpretations of tax regulations may further delay access to nuclear decommissioning trust funds for reimbursement of spent nuclear fuel storage costs depending on how the internal revenue service irs or the department of treasury ultimately interpret irs regulations addressing the taxation of a qualified nuclear decommissioning trust sdge may be restricted from withdrawing amounts from its qualified decommissioning trusts to pay for independent spent fuel storage installations isfsi where edison and sdge are seeking or plan to seek recovery of the isfsi costs in litigation against the doe until the doe litigation is resolved sdge expects to pay for such isfsi costs unless and until the irs or the department of treasury issue guidance directed to either edison or sdge or to all taxpayers that provides that such isfsi costs can be funded by qualified nuclear decommissioning trusts if edison and sdge are unable to obtain timely reimbursement of such costs such failure could delay decommissioning activities and negatively impact sdges cash flows 

 

in november 2014 the cpuc approved the amended settlement agreement that resolved the investigation into the steamgenerator replacement project that ultimately led to the shutdown of songs petitions have been filed to reopen the settlement as we discuss in note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

a proposal has been made regarding certain intrarate case income tax benefits that if adopted by the cpuc could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s socalgas’ and sempra energy’s business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

as we discuss in note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report in september 2015 the california utilities filed settlement agreements with the cpuc that resolve all material matters related to the 2016 general rate case proceeding except for the revenue requirement implications of certain income tax benefits associated with flowthrough repair allowance tax deductions the settlement agreements exclude a proposal for both sdge and socalgas regarding certain intrarate case income tax benefits the proposal recommends that the cpuc adjust socalgas’ rate base by 92 million and sdge’s rate base by 93 million and additionally reduce both utilities’ revenue requirements by amounts currently being tracked in income tax memorandum accounts for the year 2015 we believe the proposed treatment would violate and contradict long standing rate making and income tax policy and would represent a material departure from historical practice at december 31 2015 the pretax balances tracked in these memorandum accounts total 74 million for socalgas and 39 million for sdge if this proposal is adopted the outcome would reduce the revenue requirement amounts agreed to in sdge’s and socalgas’ settlement agreements sdge and socalgas do not expect that the prospective reduction to rate base described above would result in an immediate earnings impact if this proposal is adopted however if this proposal is adopted the amounts currently being tracked in the tax memorandum accounts for 2015 could result in a material charge against earnings when the draft decision is received 

 

 

risks related to our sempra international and sempra us gas  power businesses 

 

our businesses are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices and our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks energyrelated commodity prices impact lng liquefaction and regasification the transport and storage of natural gas and power generation from renewable and conventional sources among other businesses that we operate and invest in 

 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for lng terminals or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas lng electricity or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions 

 

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated commodities result from multiple factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

when our businesses enter into fixedprice longterm contracts to provide services or commodities they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks 

 

sempra mexico sempra renewables and sempra natural gas generally endeavor to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure however if these contracts are at fixed prices the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures including rising operational costs costs of labor materials equipment and commodities and rising interest rates that affect financing costs we may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects providing for cost escalation providing for direct passthrough of operating costs or entering into hedges however these measures if implemented may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses andor financing costs the failure to fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled or be completed within budget which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

the acquisition development construction and expansion of lng terminals natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and storage facilities electric generation transmission and distribution facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built 

 

success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be materially adversely affected by among other factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to complete a development project or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or natural gas regasification liquefaction and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification liquefaction storage transmission and distribution systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

the design development and construction of the cameron lng liquefaction facility involves numerous risks and uncertainties 

 

with respect to our project to add lng export capability at the cameron lng facility the cameron lng holdings llc joint venture cameron lng jv has begun building an lng export facility consisting of three liquefaction trains designed to a total nameplate capacity of 139 million tonnes per annum mtpa of lng with an expected export capability of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf per day the anticipated incremental investment in the threetrain liquefaction project is estimated to be approximately 7 billion including the cost of the lumpsum turnkey construction contract development engineering costs and permitting costs but excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs the total cost of the facility including the cost of our original regasification facility contributed to the joint venture plus interest during construction financing costs and required reserves is estimated to be approximately 10 billion the majority of the incremental investment in the joint venture will be projectfinanced and the balance provided by the project partners any failure by the project partners to make their required investments on a timely basis could result in project delays and could materially adversely affect the development of the project in addition sempra energy has entered into completion guarantees under which it has guaranteed a maximum 37 billion of principal amount of the project financing for the project these guarantees terminate upon cameron lng jv’s achieving “financial completion” of the initial threetrain liquefaction project including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests if due to the joint venture’s failure to satisfy the financial completion criteria we are required to repay some or all of the 37 billion principal amount of project debt under our completion guarantees any such repayments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

 

largescale construction projects like the design development and construction of the cameron lng liquefaction facility involve numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the potential for unforeseen engineering problems substantial construction delays and increased costs cameron lng jv has a turnkey epc contract with a joint venture contractor comprised of subsidiaries of chicago bridge  iron company nv and chiyoda corporation who are jointly and severally liable for performance under the contract if the contractor becomes unwilling or unable to perform according to the terms and timetable of the epc contract cameron lng jv would be required to engage a substitute contractor which would result in project delays and increased costs which could be significant the construction of this facility requires a large and specialized work force necessary equipment and materials and sophisticated engineering there can be no assurance that cameron lng jv’s contractor will not encounter delays due to disruptions in obtaining the necessary equipment and materials inability to field the necessary workforce or engineering issues that were not contemplated as construction progresses cameron lng jv may decide or be forced to submit change orders to the contractor that could result in longer construction periods and higher construction costs or both in addition weather conditions new regulation labor disputes breakdown or failure of equipment and litigation such as the lawsuit filed by the sierra club and gulf restoration network challenging the june 19 2014 ferc order that approved the construction of the cameron lng liquefaction project could substantially delay the project as we do not control cameron lng jv we are dependent on reaching a consensus with one or more of our joint venture partners to resolve a variety of issues that could transpire the inability to timely resolve issues including construction issues could cause substantial delays to the completion of this project a substantial delay could result in cost overruns substantially postpone the earnings we anticipate deriving from this facility and require additional cash investments by us and our joint venture partners the anticipated cost of this project is based on a number of assumptions that may prove incorrect and the ultimate cost could significantly exceed the current estimate of approximately 7 billion of incremental investment excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

 

we face many challenges to develop and complete our contemplated lng export facilities 

 

in addition to the threetrain cameron lng liquefaction facility described above we are looking at several other lng export terminal development opportunities including a greenfield project in port arthur texas a brownfield project at our existing energía costa azul regasification facility in baja california mexico and an expansion of up to two additional liquefaction trains to the cameron liquefaction facility each of these contemplated projects faces numerous risks and must overcome significant hurdles before we can proceed with construction common to all of these projects is the risk that an extended decline in current and forward projections of crude oil prices could reduce the demand for natural gas in some sectors and cause a corresponding reduction in projected global demand for lng this could result in increased competition among those working on projects in an environment of declining lng demand such as the sempra energysponsored export initiatives such reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of coal in new power generation which could also lead to increased competition among the lng suppliers for the declining lng demand oil prices at certain moderate levels could also make lng projects in other parts of the world still feasible and competitive with lng projects from north america thus increasing supply and the competition for the available lng demand a decline in natural gas prices outside the united states which in many foreign countries are based on the price of crude oil may also materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices based on henry hub pricing 

 

sempra natural gas has entered into a project development agreement for the joint development of the proposed port arthur liquefaction project with an affiliate of woodside petroleum ltd the agreement specifies how the parties will share costs and establishes a framework for the parties to work jointly on permitting design engineering and commercial and marketing activities associated with developing the port arthur liquefaction project also sempra natural gas ienova and a subsidiary of pemex entered into a memorandum of understanding to collaborate in and share the costs of the potential development of a liquefaction project at ienova’s energía costa azul facility in mexico any decisions by the parties to proceed with binding agreements with respect to the formation of these potential joint ventures and the potential development of these projects will require among other things completion of project assessments and achieving other necessary internal and external approvals of each such party in addition all of our proposed projects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the receipt of a number of permits and approvals finding suitable partners and customers obtaining financing negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements including joint venture agreements tolling capacity agreements or natural gas supply and lng sales agreements and construction contracts and reaching a final investment decision 

 

expansion of the cameron lng liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the joint venture project financing agreements including among others timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the project lenders furthermore there are a number of potential new projects under construction or in the process of development by various project developers in north america in addition to ours and given the projected global demand for lng the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed with respect to our port arthur texas project this is a greenfield site and therefore it may not have the advantages often associated with brownfield sites the energía costa azul facility in mexico is subject to ongoing land and permitting disputes that could make project financing difficult as well as finding suitable partners and customers in addition while we have completed the regulatory process for an lng export facility in the us the regulatory process in mexico and the overlay of us regulations for natural gas exports to an lng export facility in mexico are not well developed there can be no assurance that such a facility could be permitted and constructed without facing significant legal challenges and uncertainties which in turn could make project financing as well as finding suitable partners and customers difficult finally energía costa azul has profitable longterm regasification contracts for 100 percent of the facility making the decision to pursue a new liquefaction facility dependent in part on whether the investment in a new liquefaction facility would over the long term be more beneficial than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts 

 

there can be no assurance that our contemplated lng export facilities will be completed and our inability to complete one or more of our contemplated lng export facilities could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows results of operations and prospects 

 

we discuss these projects further in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors influencing future performance” in the annual report 

 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could reduce or eliminate lng export opportunities and demand 

 

several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations to impose more stringent permitting public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations in addition to state laws some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions such as city ordinances that may restrict the performance of or prohibit the well drilling in general andor hydraulic fracturing in particular hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions but federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities for example the epa issued permitting guidance in february 2014 under the federal safe drinking water act sdwa for hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels in april 2015 the epa issued a proposed rule that would prevent the discharge of hydraulic fracturing wastewater into publicly owned treatment works and in march 2015 the bureau of land management of the us department of the interior adopted rules imposing new requirements for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands including new requirements relating to public disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals as well as wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water in addition the us congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process there are also certain governmental reviews that have been conducted or are underway on deep shale and other formation completion and production practices including hydraulic fracturing depending on the outcome of these studies federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate or even ban such activities certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process 

 

we cannot predict whether additional federal state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit if additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations natural gas prices in north america could rise which in turn could materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices based on henry hub pricing increased regulation or difficulty in permitting of hydraulic fracturing and any corresponding increase in domestic natural gas prices could materially adversely affect demand for lng exports and our ability to develop commercially viable lng export facilities beyond the three train cameron lng facility currently under construction 

 

increased competition could materially adversely affect us 

 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental andor operating experience including both domestic and international and financial resources similar to or greater than ours further in recent years the natural gas pipeline storage and lng market segments have been characterized by strong and increasing competition both with respect to winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets in mexico despite the commissioning of many new energy infrastructure projects by the federal electricity commission comisión federal de electricidad or cfe and other governmental agencies in connection with energy reforms competition for recent pipeline projects has been intense with numerous bidders competing aggressively for these projects there can be no assurance that we will be successful in bidding for new development opportunities in the us mexico or south america in addition as noted above there are a number of potential new lng liquefaction projects under construction or in the process of being developed by various project developers in north america including our contemplated new projects and given the projected global demand for lng the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed finally our natural gas storage assets in the gulf coast region compete with other facilities for storage customers as existing contracts expire and for anchor customers that could support development of new capacity these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into extend or replace expiring longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition such longterm contracts once entered into increase our credit risk if our counterparties fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis due to bankruptcy insolvency or otherwise 

 

the energía costa azul lng facility and the cameron lng facility within the cameron lng jv have entered into longterm capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties at each facility under these agreements customers pay capacity reservation and usage fees to receive store and regasify the customers’ lng we also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

at cameron lng jv although the cameron lng terminal is partially contracted for regasification there is a termination agreement in place that will result in the termination of this agreement at the point in the construction of the new liquefaction facilities where piping tieins to the existing regasification terminal become necessary which we expect to occur during the first quarter of 2017 

 

sempra mexico’s and sempra natural gas’ ability to enter into or replace existing longterm firm capacity agreements for their natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include our lng facilities a significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

sempra natural gas owns a 25percent interest in rockies express pipeline llc rockies express a partnership that operates a natural gas pipeline the rockies express pipeline rex all of rockies express’ original capacity sales on rex provided for westtoeast service sempra natural gas has an agreement for such capacity on rex through november 2019 the capacity costs are offset by revenues from releases of the capacity contracted to third parties certain capacity release commitments totaling 22 million concluded during 2013 contracting activity related to that capacity has not been sufficient to offset all of our capacity payments to rockies express rockies express has been developing easttowest service offerings on rex in 2013 ferc issued a decision ruling that easttowest service offerings within a single rex zone would not result in potential rate reductions under “most favored nation” provisions in the original customers’ westtoeast contracts and certain westtoeast customers sought rehearing of that decision in 2014 and 2015 rockies express reached settlements with these westtoeast customers and the customers’ requests for rehearing have been withdrawn in addition several customers are facing liquidity issues which may result in bankruptcy there can be no assurance that if those customers enter bankruptcy that we will be able to find new customers to replace that capacity 

 

our natural gas storage assets include operational and development assets at bay gas storage company ltd bay gas in alabama and mississippi hub llc mississippi hub in mississippi as well as our development project la storage llc la storage in louisiana la storage could be positioned to support lng export from the cameron lng jv terminal and other liquefaction projects if anticipated cash flows support further investment however changes in the us natural gas market could also lead to diminished natural gas storage values historically the value of natural gas storage services has positively correlated with the difference between the seasonal prices of natural gas among other factors in general over the past several years seasonal differences in natural gas prices have declined which have contributed to lower prices for storage services as our legacy higher rate sales contracts mature at our bay gas and mississippi hub facilities replacement sales contract rates have been and could continue to be lower than has historically been the case lower sales revenues may not be offset by cost reductions which could lead to depressed asset values in addition our la storage development project may be unable to either attract cash flow commitments sufficient to support further investment or extend its ferc construction permit beyond its current expiration date of june 2017 the la storage project also includes an existing 233mile pipeline header system the la storage pipeline that is not contracted market conditions could result in the need to perform recovery testing of our recorded asset values in the event such values are not recoverable we would consider the fair value of these assets relative to their recorded value to the extent the recorded carrying value is in excess of the fair value we would record a noncash impairment charge the recorded value of our longlived natural gas storage assets at december 31 2015 was 15 billion a significant impairment charge related to our natural gas storage assets would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 

 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility and we may be unable to sell the power that sempra renewables’ and sempra   mexico’s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

we provide information about these matters in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to perform we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

our businesses and the businesses that we invest in are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements or arrangements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements or arrangements should they fail to perform we may be required to enter into alternative arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such an event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition many such agreements are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses the failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects finally we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

 

sempra mexico’s and sempra natural gas’ obligations and those of their suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for “force majeure” events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

 

our businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits 

 

we are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties adjacent to and properties where our lng terminal in mexico is located as we discuss in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report in the event that we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which our lng terminal is located we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such terminal in addition our ability to convert the lng terminal into an export facility may be hindered by these disputes and they could make project financing such a facility and finding suitable partners and customers very difficult if we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

we rely on transportation assets and services much of which we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sempra mexico and sempra natural gas also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra mexico and sempra natural gas also rely on specialized ships to transport lng to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities sempra renewables sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities electricity and other services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity natural gas supplies and lng at thencurrent spot market rates which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges 

 

in mexico we own or have interests in natural gas propane and ethane distribution storage and transportation projects electricity generation distribution and transmission facilities and an lng terminal in peru and chile we own or have interests in electricity generation transmission and distribution facilities and operations developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political legal regulatory and financial risks that vary by country including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could materially reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries we may or may not choose to hedge these risks and any hedges entered into may or may not be effective fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in significantly increased taxes in foreign countries and materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

we discuss litigation related to sempra mexico’s energía costa azul lng terminal and other international energy projects in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

 

other risks 

 

sempra energy has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control 

 

sempra energy makes investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control as described above sdge holds a 20percent ownership interest in songs which is in the process of being decommissioned by edison its majority owner sempra natural gas accounts for its investment in the cameron lng jv under the equity method which investment is 983 million at december 31 2015 also sempra natural gas owns a 25percent interest in rockies express a joint venture that operates the rex natural gas pipeline our investment in rockies express was 477 million at december 31 2015 at december 31 2015 sempra renewables had investments totaling 855 million in several joint ventures to develop and operate renewable generation facilities sempra mexico has a 50percent interest in a joint venture with pemex that operates several natural gas pipelines and propane and ethane systems in northern mexico sempra mexico also has a 50percent interest in a renewables wind project in baja california at december 31 2015 these investments totaled 519 million sempra energy has an investment balance of 67 million at december 31 2015 that reflects remaining distributions expected to be received from the rbs sempra commodities llp rbs sempra commodities partnership as it is dissolved the timing and amount of distributions may be impacted by the matters we discuss related to rbs sempra commodities in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report the failure to collect all or a substantial portion of our remaining investment in the rbs sempra commodities partnership could have a corresponding impact on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

sempra renewables and sempra natural gas have provided guarantees related to joint venture financing agreements and sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico have provided loans to joint ventures in which they have investments and to other affiliates we discuss the guarantees in note 4 and affiliate loans in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

we have limited influence over these ventures and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest in addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we discuss our investments further in notes 3 4 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

market performance or changes in other assumptions could require sempra energy sdge andor socalgas to make significant unplanned contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees a decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans in addition the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors including the assumed rate of return on plan assets employee demographics discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations rates of increase in health care costs levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation an adverse change in any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects

government regulation 

 

 

california state utility regulation 

 

the california utilities are regulated by the california public utilities commission cpuc the california energy commission cec and the california air resources board carb 

 

the california public utilities commission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cpuc also oversees and regulates new products and services including solar and wind energy bioenergy and other forms of renewable energy in addition the cpuc’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety violations 

 

we provide further discussion in notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge is also subject to regulation by the cec which publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based on these forecasts the cec 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the california utilities’ longterm investment decisions 

 

in 2010 the state of california required certain california electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver 20 percent of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the renewables portfolio standard rps program in december 2011 california senate bill 21x 33 rps program went into effect superseding the previous rps program the 33 rps program requires each electric utility within the state of california to procure 33 percent of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2020 with an average 20 percent required over the threeyear period january 1 2011 through december 31 2013 25 percent by december 31 2016 and 33 percent by december 31 2020 we discuss this requirement as it applies to sdge in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

certification of a generation project by the cec as an eligible renewable energy resource err allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements if such purchase meets the provisions of california senate bill 21x this may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by sempra renewables and sempra mexico particularly from california utilities sempra renewables’ copper mountain solar 1 facility in nevada is certified as an err sempra renewables has 50percent interests in both the copper mountain solar 2 and mesquite solar 1 facilities both of which have err certification sempra renewables has received precertification of the copper mountain solar 3 facility and is submitting applications for err certification of each phase as it begins operations in may 2014 sempra renewables acquired a 50percent ownership interest in four fully operating solar facilities in california or the california solar partnership these facilities have err certification we plan to obtain err certification for all of our renewable facilities operating in andor providing power to california as they become operational 

 

california   assembly bill ab 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 assigns responsibility to carb for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions the bill requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a department within the california environmental protection agency an organization that reports directly to the governor’s office in the executive branch of california state government sempra natural gas and sempra mexico are also subject to the rules and regulations of carb we provide further discussion in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

we describe other regulatory matters in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

  

california natural gas utility operations 

 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers and sdge’s core customers on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others we discuss the california utilities’ resource planning natural gas procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters below we also provide further discussion in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

customers 

 

at december 31 2014 socalgas had approximately 59 million customer meters consisting of approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2014 sdge had approximately 868000 natural gas customer meters consisting of approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial and industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers socalgas’ wholesale customers are primarily other investorowned utilities ious including sdge or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial and industrial customers 

 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the california utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements 

 

in 2014 socalgas added approximately 26000 new connected natural gas customer meters and in 2013 it added approximately 23000 new connected meters representing an annual growth rate of 04 percent in both years sdge’s connected natural gas customer meters increased by approximately 3000 in 2014 representing an annual growth rate of 04 percent in 2013 it added nearly 5000 new connected meters representing an annual growth rate of 06 percent based on forecasts of new housing starts socalgas and sdge each expect that their new meter annual growth rates in 2015 will be slightly higher than those achieved in 2014 

 

 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

 

socalgas   purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the california utilities’ core customers socalgas purchases natural gas from canada the us rockies and the southwestern us to meet its and sdge’s core customer requirements and maintain supply reliability it also purchases some california natural gas production and additional supplies delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

 

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has entered into firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights these contracts expire on various dates between 2015 and 2028 pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company pacific gas and electric company pge and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california the ferc regulates the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services 

 

 

natural gas storage 

 

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers the california utilities’ core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas’ storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others including sdge for its noncore customer requirements through an open bid process the storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to purchase and store natural gas when natural gas costs are low usually during the summer thereby reducing purchases when natural gas costs are expected to be higher this program allows customers to better manage their natural gas procurement and transportation needs 

 

 

demand for natural gas 

 

growth in the demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products environmental regulations renewable energy legislation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs external factors such as weather the price of electricity the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources demand for natural gas outside the state of california and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price which may in turn impact demand 

 

the california utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on customers’ preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products in the noncore industrial market some customers are capable of securing alternate fuel supplies from other suppliers which can affect the demand for natural gas the california utilities’ ability to maintain their respective industrial market shares is largely dependent on the relative price spread between delivered natural gas and potential fuel alternatives 

 

natural gas demand for electric generation within southern california competes with electric power generated throughout the western united states natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the growth in renewable generation the addition of more efficient gas technologies and the extent that regulatory changes and electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the california utilities’ respective service areas the demand may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources we provide additional information regarding the electric industry in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and cash provided from operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry socalgas injects natural gas into storage during the summer months usually april through october which reduces cash provided from operating activities during this period for withdrawal from storage during the winter months usually november through march which increases cash provided from operating activities when customer demand is higher 

 

 

electric utility operations 

 

 

sdge 

 

 

customers 

 

sdge’s service area covers 4100 square miles at december 31 2014 sdge had 14 million electric customer meters consisting of approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sdge’s active electric customer meters increased by approximately 8000 and 7000 in 2014 and 2013 respectively representing annual growth rates of 06 percent and 05 percent respectively based on forecasting of new housing starts sdge expects that its new meter annual growth rate in 2015 will be slightly higher than the growth in 2014 

 

 

resource planning and power procurement 

 

sdge’s resource planning power procurement and related regulatory matters are discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

rates and regulation – utilities 

 

we provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to our utilities in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

sempra international and sempra us gas  power 

 

sempra international and sempra us gas  power contain most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to california utility regulation in addition to the discussion of our south american utilities above we provide descriptions of these operating units’ segments and information concerning their operations in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 3 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

competition 

 

sempra energy’s nonutility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar services they are engaged in highly competitive activities that require significant capital investments and highly skilled and experienced personnel among these competitors there may be significant variation in financial personnel and other resources compared to sempra international and sempra us gas  power 

 

generation – renewables 

 

sempra renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity through its development of and investments in wind and solar generation facilities for sales of noncontracted renewable energy sempra renewables competes with other nonutility generators regulated utilities unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy service companies the number and type of competitors may vary based on location generation type and project size also regulatory initiatives designed to enhance energy consumption from renewable resources for regulated utility companies may increase competition from these types of institutions these utilities may have a lower cost of capital than most independent renewable power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms this recovery allows them to build buy and upgrade renewable generation projects without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments additionally generation from sempra renewables’ renewable energy assets is exposed to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind inclement weather and hours of sunlight 

 

our renewable energy competitors include among others 

 

 

because sempra mexico sells the power that it generates at its energía sierra juárez wind project into california it is also impacted by these competitive factors 

 

natural gas pipelines and storage facilities 

 

within its market area sempra natural gas’ and sempra mexico’s pipelines businesses and sempra natural gas’ storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines they compete primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets 

 

sempra natural gas’ competitors include among others 

 

 

sempra mexico’s natural gas pipeline competitors include among others

technological advances associated with shale gas and tight oil production have reduced the forecasted need for north american lng import facilities and increased interest in liquefaction and export opportunities 

 

at current forward gas prices us gulf coast liquefaction appears to be among the most price competitive potential lng supply in the world brownfield liquefaction is particularly price competitive resulting from many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

global lng competition primarily from canada russia east africa and australia may limit us lng exports as international liquefaction projects attempt to match us gulf coast lng production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility host governments for international liquefaction projects are altering fiscal and tax regimes in an effort to make projects in their jurisdictions competitive relative to us projects however sustained low oil prices may cause some of the international projects to become unfeasible due to their lng price formulas’ link to oil prices it is expected that us lng exports will increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand and thereby facilitate development of a global commodity market for natural gas 

 

on october 1 2014 sempra natural gas and its joint venture project partners completed the formation of a joint venture for their investment in the development construction and operation of a natural gas liquefaction export facility our 502percent retained equity in the joint venture cameron lng holdings was derived from the contribution of our existing cameron lng regasification facility in hackberry louisiana to the joint venture the new liquefaction facility which began construction in the second half of 2014 will utilize cameron lng’s existing facilities including two marine berths three lng storage tanks and vaporization capability of 15 billion cubic feet bcf per day the joint venture has authorization to export lng to both free trade agreement fta countries and to countries that do not have an fta with the united states 

 

cameron lng holdings has 20year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with gdf suez sa and affiliates of mitsubishi corporation and mitsui  co ltd that subscribe the full nameplate capacity of the facility we discuss cameron lng holdings in notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report our joint venture partners affiliates of gdf suez sa mitsubishi corporation through a related company jointly established with nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha nyk and mitsui  co ltd compete globally to market and sell lng to end users including gas and electric utilities located in lng importing countries around the world by providing liquefaction services cameron lng holdings will compete indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global lng market in addition to the us these competitors are located in the middle east southeast asia africa south america australia and europe 

 

sempra energy is also taking steps to develop additional lng export facilities at sempra natural gas’ port arthur texas property and sempra mexico’s energía costa azul regasification facility in addition cameron lng holdings is working on the development of two additional trains these projects would compete against other global projects 

 

our lng liquefaction business’ major domestic and international competitors will include among others the following companies and their related lng affiliates 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions 

 

 

hazardous substances 

 

the cpuc’s hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allows california’s ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the california utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the california utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates 

 

at december 31 2014 we had accrued estimated remaining investigation and remediation liabilities of 7 million at sdge and 24 million at socalgas both related to hazardous waste sites for which the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism applies as described above the accruals include costs for numerous locations most of which had been manufacturedgas plants at socalgas we believe that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial condition of sempra energy sdge or socalgas 

 

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets 

 

 

air and water quality 

 

the electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent airquality and greenhouse gas standards such as those established by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the carb we discuss these standards in “government regulation – california state utility regulation” above the california utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards 

 

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other owners of songs have an agreement with the california coastal commission ccc to mitigate environmental impacts to the marine environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs during its operation songs’ early retirement described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report does not reduce sdge’s mitigation obligation sdge’s share of the mitigation costs is estimated to be 63 million of which 43 million had been incurred through december 31 2014 and 20 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050 artificial kelp reef fish hatchery and wetlands restoration projects are complete but continue to be studied until the ccc accepts the projects the remaining costs are to meet ccc acceptance requirements and maintain the projects through 2050

 item 1a risk factors 

 

when evaluating our company and its subsidiaries you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report these risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf we may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of the following occurs our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially negatively impacted in addition the trading prices of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning   our company set forth in the annual report including without limitation the information set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this section when we state that a risk or uncertainty may could or will have a “material adverse effect” on us or may could or will materially adversely affect us we mean that the risk or uncertainty may could or will have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition prospects andor the trading prices of our securities 

 

sempra energy’s cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and the ability to utilize the cash flows from those subsidiaries 

 

sempra energy’s ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own expenditures and longterm debt obligations in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including without limitation as a result of legislation regulation court order contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress 

 

a significant portion of our worldwide cash reserves are generated by and therefore held in foreign jurisdictions some jurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the united states or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash which reduces the cash available to us in addition we may be required to pay us income taxes on earnings that are not repatriated if legislation being discussed on this matter is passed to the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in or is needed by our united states operations we may incur significant us and foreign taxes andor penalties to repatriate these funds 

 

conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us 

 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and refund outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations 

 

the credit markets and financial services industry have in the past experienced periods of extreme worldwide turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of many financial institutions and by extraordinary levels of government intervention and regulation 

 

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments in difficult credit market environments we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support business activities this could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of servicing debt both of which could significantly reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability 

 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings if the credit ratings of socalgas or sdge were to be reduced their cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and any reduction in sempra energy’s credit ratings could materially adversely affect the cash flows and results of operations of sempra energy and its noncalifornia regulated utility subsidiaries if the credit ratings of sempra energy or any of its subsidiaries were to decline especially below investment grade financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase because certain counterparties may require collateral in the form of cash a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

 

sempra energy has substantial investments in mexico and south america which expose us to foreign currency legal tax economic and management oversight risk 

 

we have foreign operations in mexico and south america our for eign operations pose complex management foreign currency legal tax and economic risks which we may not be able to fully mitigate with our actions these risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic businesses our international businesses are sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers and to geopolitical uncertainties which may be driven by changes in threat environments and potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions various regional and local economic and political factors risks and uncertainties as well as us foreign policy foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our revenue costs or cash flows from our international operations which could materially adversely affect our financial performance our primary currency exposures are to the mexican peruvian and chilean currencies our primary objective in reducing foreign currency risk is to preserve the economic value of our foreign investments and to reduce earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations we may attempt to offset material crosscurrency transactions and earnings exposure through various means including financial instruments and shortterm investments because we generally do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries we are susceptible to volatility in other comprehensive income caused by exchange rate fluctuations 

 

 

risks related to all sempra energy subsidiaries 

 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation 

 

in recent years the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on the federal state and local levels these changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses moreover existing regulations laws and tariffs may be revised or reinterpreted and new regulations laws and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities special tariffs may also be imposed on components used in our businesses that could increase costs 

 

our businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements and the regulations laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs and new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations in the us and other countries in which we operate could materially adversely affect our tax expense andor tax balances changes in regulations laws and tariffs and changes in the way regulations laws and tariffs are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the california utilities and other sempra energy operations these rules are commonly referred to as the affiliate transaction rules these businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or to their interpretations or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas or to trade with the california utilities and with each other affiliate transaction rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the california utilities any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the lng terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or other operations of our subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor prospects 

 

our businesses require numerous permits licenses and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies any failure to obtain or maintain required permits licenses or approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

all of our existing and planned development projects require multiple approvals the acquisition construction ownership and operation of lng terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and electric generation and transmission facilities require numerous permits licenses certificates and other approvals from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies once received approvals may be subject to litigation and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed or modified in litigation in addition permits licenses certificates and other approvals may be modified rescinded or fail to be extended by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or failure to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities or we may be forced to incur additional costs any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain the necessary permits licenses certificates and other approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection including in particular climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees in addition we are generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our electric generation facilities and other energy projects regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown our facilities are subject to regulations protecting migratory birds which have recently been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to wind farms failure to comply with applicable environmental laws may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines andor significant curtailments of our operations which could materially adversely affect our cash flows andor results of operations 

 

the scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations including their effects on our current operations and future expansions are difficult to predict increasing international national regional and statelevel concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions including carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations the implementation of recent and proposed california and federal legislation and regulation may materially adversely affect our unregulated businesses by imposing among other things additional costs associated with emission limits controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits similarly the california utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates even if recoverable the effects of existing and proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth and may have a material adverse effect on the california utilities’ cash flows sdge may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

 

in addition existing and future laws and regulation on mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates or other emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees and taxes that could materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows 

 

we provide further discussion of these matters in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

severe weather conditions natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by severe weather conditions natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis and fires catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism because we are in the business of using storing transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials as well as radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure as well as the risks to the surrounding communities are substantially greater than the risks such incidents may pose to a typical business the facilities and infrastructure we own that may be subject to such incidents include but are not limited to 

 

 

  

such incidents could result in severe business disruptions significant decreases in revenues andor significant additional costs to us any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires leaks radioactive releases explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties or cause personal injuries or fatalities any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us in some cases we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault and in cases where the concept of inverse condemnation applies we may be liable for damages without being found to be at fault or to have been negligent insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become unavailable for certain of these risks and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

severe weather conditions may also impact our businesses on january 17 2014 the governor of california declared a state of emergency because of severe drought conditions in the state the drought conditions in california and the western united states increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories which could place third party property and our electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy the drought conditions also reduce the amount of power available from hydroelectric generation facilities in the northwest united states which could adversely impact the availability of a reliable energy supply into the california electric grid managed by the california iso if alternate supplies of electric generation are not available to replace the lower level of power available from hydroelectric generation facilities this could result in temporary power shortages in sdge’s service territory 

 

our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against us 

 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and arbitration proceedings we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and proceedings and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings we discuss these proceedings in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report the uncertainties inherent in lawsuits arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part from our customers which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations andor financial condition 

 

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices in addition for those contract positions that are hedged our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned 

 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng electric generation capacity and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

 

in addition certain of the contracts we use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for that contract in certain cases these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged 

 

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

 

although we have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by our businesses or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

 

the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees 

 

several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a facilitybyfacility basis 

 

any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions these potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

 

new business technologies present a risk for attacks on our information systems and the integrity of our energy grid and our natural gas pipeline infrastructure and storage 

 

cybersecurity and the protection of our operations and other activities and our customer and employee information are a priority at sempra energy sdge and socalgas in addition to general information and cyber risks that all fortune 500 corporations face eg malware malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information smart grid infrastructure and natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure deployment of new business technologies represents a new and largescale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer information as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure while our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks to date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across sempra energy’s businesses but we cannot ensure that a successful attack will not occur an attack on our information systems unauthorized access to confidential customer information the integrity of the energy grid or the natural gas infrastructure or one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

in the ordinary course of business sempra energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees customer energy usage and other information the theft damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws subject us to claims from third parties require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations and harm our reputation 

 

finally as seen with recent cyberattacks on us corporations the goal of a cyberattack may be primarily to inflict large scale harm on a company and the places where it operates any such cyberattack could cause widespread disruptions to our operating and administrative systems including the destruction of critical information and programming that could materially adversely affect our business operations and the integrity of the power grid andor release confidential information about our company and our customers employees and other constituents 

 

our businesses will need to continue to adapt to technological change which may cause us to incur significant expenditures to adapt to these changes and which efforts may not be successful 

 

we expect that emerging technologies may be superior to or may not be compatible with some of our existing technologies investments and infrastructure and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive or result in the obsolescence of certain operating assets our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets if we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological changes fail to adapt to significant technological changes fail to obtain access to important new technologies or fail to recover a significant portion of any remaining investment in obsolete assets our businesses operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected examples of technological changes that could impact our businesses include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risks related to the california utilities 

 

the california utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may materially adversely affect us 

 

the cpuc regulates the california utilities’ rates except sdge’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates the california utilities’ 

 

 

  

the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance safety standards and practices compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows socalgas and sdge may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines and for sdge electric operations under new regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety and new citation programs concerning both gas and electric safety which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the california utilities’ rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

the california utilities may invest a significant amount of money in a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if the project does not receive regulatory approval if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes or if management decides not to proceed with the project they may be unable to recover all amounts invested in that project which could materially adversely affect their financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

the cpuc periodically approves the california utilities’ rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs including income taxes and an authorized rate of return on investment if actual capital expenditures andor operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the cpuc our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected reductions in key benchmark interest rates may trigger automatic adjustment mechanisms which would reduce the california utilities’ authorized rates of return changes in which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

 

the cpuc applies performancebased measures and mechanisms to all california utilities under these earnings potential over authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals and reductions in authorized base margins are tied to not achieving specific performance and operating goals at both of the california utilities the areas that are currently eligible for performance mechanisms are operational activities designated by the cpuc and energy efficiency programs at sdge electric reliability performance and at socalgas natural gas procurement and unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services although the california utilities have received incentive awards in the past there can be no assurance that they will receive awards in the future or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods additionally if the california utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets and other similar matters involving sdge 

 

the california utilities may be materially adversely affected by new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how they operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses 

 

the construction and expansion of the california utilities’ natural gas pipelines socalgas’ storage facilities and sdge’s electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits licenses and other approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies if there are delays in obtaining these approvals or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the california utilities’ businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially adversely affected coordinating these projects so that they are on time and within budget requires competent execution from our employees and contractors cooperation of third parties and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay in the event that one or more of these major projects is delayed or experiences significant cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on the california utilities 

 

our california utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as the utility reform network turn utility consumers’ action network ucan and other stakeholder and advocacy groups operations that may be influenced by these groups include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

natural gas pipeline safety assessments may not be fully or adequately recovered in rates 

 

pending the outcome of various regulatory agency evaluations of natural gas pipeline safety regulations practices and procedures the california utilities may incur substantial incremental expense and capital investment associated with their natural gas pipeline operations and investments including under sdge’s and socalgas’ pipeline safety enhancement plan psep currently estimated to be 21 billion 16 billion for socalgas and 500 million for sdge over 10 years for the first phase of this project 

 

in june 2014 the cpuc issued a final decision in the triennial cost allocation proceeding tcap addressing sdges and socalgas’ psep that approved the utilities’ model for implementing psep and established the criteria to determine the amounts related to psep that may be recovered from ratepayers and the processes for recovery of such amounts including providing that such costs are subject to a reasonableness review in july 2014 the cpuc office of ratepayer advocates ora and turn filed a joint application for rehearing of the cpuc’s june 2014 final decision 

 

if the cpuc were to decide as part of any future reasonableness review that rate recovery not be allowed for certain gas pipeline safety costs incurred by sdge and socalgas or if the cpuc were to decide in favor of the oraturn joint application for rehearing it could materially adversely affect the respective companys cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

 

we provide additional information in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the california utilities are subject to increasingly stringent safety standards and the potential for significant penalties if regulators deem either sdge or socalgas to be out of compliance 

 

the california state senate passed legislation in 2013 sb 291 which requires the cpuc to develop and maintain a safety enforcement program that includes procedures for monitoring data tracking and analysis and investigations as well as delegates citation authority to cpuc staff personnel under the direction of the cpuc executive director this legislation requires the cpuc to implement the enforcement program for natural gas safety by july 1 2014 and for electric safety by january 1 2015 in exercising the citation authority the cpuc staff will take into account voluntary reporting of potential violations voluntary resolution efforts undertaken prior history of violations the gravity of the violation and the degree of culpability the cpuc is planning to adopt an administrative limit on the maximum monetary penalty that may be set by the cpuc staff 

 

in may 2014 the cpuc initiated a rulemaking proceeding to develop the necessary enforcement programs pursuant to the requirements of sb 291 with the cpuc issuing a decision on the electric safety enforcement program in the fourth quarter of 2014 we expect a cpuc decision making future refinements to the electric and gas safety programs in 2015 

 

in december 2011 the cpuc adopted a natural gas safety citation program whereby natural gas distribution companies can be fined by cpuc staff for violations of the cpuc’s safety standards or federal standards each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense the maximum penalty is 50000 per offense in september 2013 the cpuc issued standard operating procedures setting forth its principles and management process for the gas safety citation program 

 

if the cpuc or its staff determine that either of sdge’s or socalgas’ operations and practices are not in compliance with the safety standards the corrective actions required to be in conformance and any penalties imposed could materially adversely affect the respective company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects 

 

meaningful rate reform is necessary because the current multitiered electric rate design in california results in a disproportionately high amount of sdge’s fixed cost of operating and maintaining its electric infrastructure being borne by higher use consumers in the residential customer class which results in excessively high electric rates that indirectly subsidize lower use consumers in the residential customer class the failure by the cpuc to reform sdge’s rate structure in a relevant manner could have a material adverse effect on its business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

the current electric rate structure in california places an undue burden on residential customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers in addition due to current rate structures and state policies customers who selfgenerate their own power primarily solar installations currently do not pay their proportionate cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system subject to certain limitations while they still receive power from the system when their selfgeneration is inadequate to meet their electricity needs as more higher electric use residential customers switch to selfgeneration or obtain local offthegrid sources of power the burden on the remaining higher electric use customers increases which in turn encourages more selfgeneration and increases rate pressures in addition the increase of solar other forms of selfgeneration and other local offthegrid sources of power adversely impacts the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system over the mid to longterm this rate structure is unsustainable on january 1 2014 ab 327 became effective this law restores to the cpuc the authority to establish electric rates for electric utility companies in california and removes the rate caps established in ab 1x adopted in early 2001 during california’s energy crisis as well as senate bill 695 adopted in 2009 additionally the law provides the cpuc with the authority to adopt up to a 1000 monthly fixed charge for all residential customers effective january 1 2015 in february 2014 sdge filed comprehensive proposals with the cpuc that provide a roadmap to reforming electric residential rate base design beginning in 2015 and continuing through 2018 consistent with the provisions of ab 327 the cpuc will implement ab 327 through its current order instituting rulemaking proceeding regarding electric rate reform 

 

in july 2014 the cpuc initiated a rulemaking proceeding to develop a successor tariff to the state’s existing net energy metering nem program pursuant to the provisions of ab 327 which require the cpuc to establish a revised nem tariff or similar program by december 31 2015 the nem program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of onsite renewable generation it was originally established in california in 1995 with the adoption of senate bill 656 as codified in section 2827 of the public utilities code currently customers who install and operate eligible renewable generation facilities of 1 megawatt or less may choose to participate in the nem program under nem customergenerators receive a full retailrate bill credit for the power they generate that is fed back to the utility’s power grid and during times when the customer’s generation exceeds their own energy usage meaningful rate reform is necessary to ensure that sdge is authorized to recover its costs in providing services to nem customers due to among other issues the increased power supply from renewable energy sources and the growth in distributed and local power generation 

 

if the cpuc fails to reform rate structures to maintain reasonable costbased electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

recovery of 2007 wildfire litigation costs requires future regulatory approval 

 

sdge is seeking to recover in rates its reasonably incurred costs of resolving 2007 wildfire claims in excess of its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties through december 31 2014 sdge’s costs to settle these claims and its estimated future settlement costs and defense costs have exceeded its liability insurance coverage and the amounts recovered from thirdparties sdge has concluded that it is probable that sdge will be permitted to recover a substantial portion of these excess costs in rates and at december 31 2014 sempra energy’s and sdge’s consolidated balance sheets include assets of 373 million in other regulatory assets of which 366 million is related to cpucregulated operations and 7 million is related to fercregulated operations with respect to these excess costs however recovery of these amounts in rates will require future regulatory approval 

 

in december 2012 the cpuc issued a final decision allowing sdge to maintain its authorized memorandum account enabling sdge to file applications with the cpuc requesting recovery of amounts properly recorded in the memorandum account subject to reasonableness review at a later date for a description of this proceeding and information about 2007 wildfire litigation costs and their recovery see notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge will continue to assess the probability of recovery of these excess wildfire costs in rates should sdge conclude that recovery in rates is no longer probable sdge will record a charge against earnings at the time such conclusion is reached if sdge had concluded that the recovery of regulatory assets related to cpucregulated operations was no longer probable or was less than currently estimated as of december 31 2014 the resulting aftertax charge against earnings would have been up to 217 million 

 

as noted above recovery of excess wildfire costs in rates will require future regulatory approval and a failure to obtain all or a significant portion of the expected recovery or a conclusion that recovery in rates is no longer probable would likely have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s and sdge’s cash flows financial condition andor results of operations in addition if recovery is permitted the collection process may extend over a number of years we discuss how we assess the probability of recovery of our regulatory assets in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility 

 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california operated by southern california edison company or edison the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities on june 6 2013 edison notified sdge that it had reached a decision to permanently retire songs’ units 2 and 3 and seek approval from the nrc to start the decommissioning activities for the entire facility although the facility will be decommissioned in the future sdge’s ownership interest in songs continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility which include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition sdge maintains two trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission songs up to approximately 32 percent of the trust assets has been generally invested in equity securities which are subject to market fluctuation a decline in the market value of trust assets or an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts could increase the funding requirements for these trusts which in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates furthermore cpuc approval is required in order to make withdrawals from these trusts sdge may not receive these approvals during periods where cash is required to be expended for decommissioning and approval for certain expenditures may be denied by the cpuc altogether if the cpuc determines that the expenditures are unreasonable finally decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore may exceed the amounts in the trust funds recovery for those overruns would require cpuc approval which may not occur 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

 

risks related to our sempra international and sempra us gas  power businesses 

 

our businesses are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices and our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks energyrelated commodity prices impact lng liquefaction and regasification the transport and storage of natural gas and power generation from renewable and conventional sources among other businesses that we operate 

 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for power plants or for lng terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas lng or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions 

 

sempra mexico sempra renewables and sempra natural gas generate electricity that they sell under longterm contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets sempra mexico and sempra natural gas purchase natural gas to fuel their power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy their contractual obligations as part of their risk management strategy they may hedge a substantial portion of their electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage their portfolios which subjects us to the risk that the counterparty to such hedge may be unable to fulfill its obligations such a failure could materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition andor results of operations sempra natural gas’ generation asset the remaining 625mw block of the mesquite power plant is currently held for sale and we expect to complete a pending sale in the first half of 2015 subject to obtaining third party consents for the assignment of an associated 25year power sales contract to the buyer we discuss the pending sale in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated commodities result from multiple factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

the ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

when our businesses enter into fixedprice longterm contracts to provide services or commodities they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks 

 

sempra mexico sempra renewables and sempra natural gas generally endeavor to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure however if these contracts are at fixed prices the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures including rising operational costs costs of labor materials equipment and commodities and rising interest rates that affect financing costs we may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects providing for cost escalation providing for direct passthrough of operating costs or entering into hedges however these measures if implemented may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses andor financing costs the failure to so fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled or be completed within budget which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

the acquisition development construction and expansion of lng terminals natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and storage facilities electric generation and transmission facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built 

 

success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

successful completion of a particular project may be materially adversely affected by among other factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

if we are unable to complete a development project or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of electric generation or natural gas regasification liquefaction and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification liquefaction storage and transmission systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

with respect to our project to add lng export capability at the cameron lng facility the newly formed joint venture cameron lng holdings llc cameron lng holdings has begun building an lng export facility consisting of three liquefaction trains with a total nameplate capacity of 135 million tonnes per annum mtpa of lng with an expected export capability of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf per day the anticipated incremental investment in the threetrain liquefaction project is estimated to be approximately 7 billion excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs while our joint venture partners made a final investment decision to proceed our joint venture became effective and financing was procured for the project there are still a number of risks to completing this project cameron lng holdings has a turnkey engineering procurement and construction epc contract with a joint venture contractor comprised of subsidiaries of chicago bridge  iron company nv and chiyoda corporation who are jointly and severally liable for performance under the contract if the contractor becomes unwilling or unable to perform according to the terms and timetable of the epc contract cameron lng holdings would be required to engage a substitute contractor which would result in project delays and in increased costs the construction of this facility requires a large and specialized work force necessary equipment and materials and sophisticated engineering there can be no assurance that cameron lng holdings’ contractor will not encounter delays due to disruptions in obtaining the necessary equipment and materials inability to field the necessary workforce or engineering issues that were not contemplated as construction progresses cameron lng holdings may decide or be forced to submit change orders to the contractor that could result in longer construction periods and higher construction costs or both in addition weather conditions new regulation labor disputes breakdown or failure of equipment and litigation such as the lawsuit filed by the sierra club and gulf restoration network challenging the june 19 2014 ferc order that approved the construction of the cameron lng liquefaction project could substantially delay the project as we do not control cameron lng holdings we are dependent on reaching a consensus with one or more of our joint venture partners to resolve a variety of issues that could transpire the inability to timely resolve issues including construction issues could cause substantial delays to the completion of this project a substantial delay could result in cost overruns substantially postpone the earnings we anticipate deriving from this facility and require additional cash investments by us and our joint venture partners the anticipated cost of this project is based on a number of assumptions that may prove incorrect and the ultimate cost could significantly exceed the current estimate of approximately 7 billion of incremental investment excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

 

we face many challenges to develop and complete our contemplated lng export facilities 

 

in addition to the threetrain cameron liquefaction facility described above we are looking at several other lng export terminal development opportunities including a greenfield project in port arthur texas a brownfield project at our existing energía costa azul regasification facility in baja california mexico and an expansion of up to two additional liquefaction trains to the cameron facility each of these contemplated projects faces numerous risks and must overcome significant hurdles before we can proceed with construction common to all of these projects is the risk that an extended decline in current and forward projections of crude oil prices could reduce the demand for natural gas in some sectors and cause a corresponding reduction in projected global demand for lng this could result in increased competition among those working on projects in an environment of declining lng demand such as the sempra energysponsored export initiatives such reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of coal in new power generation which could also lead to increased competition among the lng suppliers for the declining lng demand oil prices at certain moderate levels could also make lng projects in other parts of the world still feasible and competitive with lng projects from north america thus increasing supply and the competition for the available lng demand a decline in natural gas prices outside the united states which in many foreign countries are based on the price of crude oil may also materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices based on henry hub pricing in addition all of our proposed projects require the receipt of a number of permits and regulatory approvals finding suitable partners and customers obtaining financing and negotiating suitable construction contracts 

 

expansion of the cameron lng facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the joint venture project financing agreements furthermore there are a number of potential new projects contemplated by various developers in north america in addition to ours and given the projected global demand for lng the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed with respect to our port arthur texas project this is a greenfield site and therefore it may not have the cost advantages often associated with brownfield sites the energía costa azul facility in mexico is subject to ongoing land and permitting disputes that could make project financing difficult as well as finding suitable partners and customers in addition while we have completed the regulatory process for an lng export facility in the us the regulatory process in mexico and the overlay of us regulations for natural gas exports to an lng export facility in mexico are not well developed there can be no assurance that such a facility could be permitted and constructed without facing significant legal challenges and uncertainties which in turn could make project financing difficult as well as finding suitable partners and customers finally energía costa azul has profitable longterm regasification contracts for 100 percent of the facility making the decision to pursue a new liquefaction facility dependent in part on whether the investment in a new liquefaction facility would be more profitable than just continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts 

 

there can be no assurance that our contemplated lng export facilities will be completed and our inability to complete one or more of our contemplated lng export facilities could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows results of operations and prospects 

 

increased competition could materially adversely affect us 

 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental andor operating experience including both domestic and international and financial resources similar to or greater than ours further in recent years the natural gas pipeline storage and lng market segments have been characterized by strong and increasing competition both with respect to winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets in mexico despite the commissioning of many new energy infrastructure projects by the federal electricity commission comisión federal de electricidad or cfe and other governmental agencies in connection with energy reforms competition for recent pipeline projects has been intense with numerous bidders competing aggressively for these projects there can be no assurance that we will be successful in bidding for new development opportunities in the us mexico or south america in addition as noted above there are a number of potential new lng liquefaction projects contemplated by various developers in north america including our contemplated new projects and given the projected global demand for lng the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed finally our natural gas storage assets in the gulf coast region compete with other facilities for storage customers as existing contracts expire and for anchor customers that could support development of new capacity these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into extend or replace expiring longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition such longterm contracts once entered into increase our credit risk if our counterparties fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis due to bankruptcy insolvency or otherwise 

 

the energía costa azul lng facility and the cameron lng facility within the newly formed cameron lng holdings joint venture have entered into longterm capacity agreements under these agreements customers pay capacity reservation and usage fees to receive store and regasify the customer’s lng we also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

at cameron lng holdings although the cameron lng terminal is partially contracted for regasification there is a termination agreement in place that will result in the termination of this agreement at the point in the construction of the new liquefaction facilities where piping tieins to the existing regasification terminal become necessary which we expect to occur during the first quarter of 2017 

 

sempra mexico’s and sempra natural gas’ ability to enter into or replace existing longterm firm capacity agreements for their natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include our lng facilities a significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

sempra natural gas owns a 25percent interest in rockies express pipeline llc rockies express a partnership that operates a natural gas pipeline the rockies express pipeline rex rockies express has agreements for westtoeast capacity on rex that expire in 2019 and new contracting activity related to that capacity may not be sufficient to replace the revenues from the expiring agreements sempra natural gas also has an agreement for such capacity that expires in 2019 the capacity costs are offset by revenues from releases of the capacity to thirdparties contracting activity related to that capacity has not been sufficient to offset all of our capacity payments to rockies express 

 

historically the value of natural gas storage services has positively correlated with the difference between the seasonal prices of natural gas among other factors in general over the past several years seasonal differences in natural gas prices have declined which have contributed to lower prices for storage services as our legacy higher rate sales contracts mature at our bay gas storage company ltd bay gas and mississippi hub llc mississippi hub facilities replacement sales contract rates could be lower than has historically been the case lower sales revenues may not be offset by cost reductions which could lead to depressed asset values in addition our la storage llc la storage development project may be unable to either attract cash flow commitments sufficient to support further investment or extend its ferc construction permit beyond its expiration date of june 2015 the la storage project also includes an existing 233mile pipeline header system the la storage pipeline that is uncontracted market conditions could result in the need to perform recovery testing of our recorded asset values in the event such values are not recoverable we would consider the fair value of these assets relative to their recorded value to the extent the book value is in excess of the fair value we would record an impairment charge the book value of our equity in natural gas storage assets at december 31 2014 was 13 billion excluding intercompany loans to the projects totaling approximately 250 million a significant impairment charge related to our natural gas storage assets would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded a noncash impairment charge would reduce our book basis in the associated assets 

 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility and we may be unable to sell the power that sempra natural gas’ and sempra mexico’s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

we provide information about these matters in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 4 10 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to so perform we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

our businesses and the businesses that we invest in are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements or arrangements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements or arrangements should they fail to so perform we may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition many such agreements are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses the failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects finally we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

 

sempra mexico’s and sempra natural gas’ obligations and those of their suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for “force majeure” events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

 

legal actions challenging our property rights could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

we are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties on and adjacent to our lng terminal in mexico as we discuss in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report in the event that we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which our lng terminal is located we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such terminal in addition our ability to convert the lng terminal into an export facility may be hindered by these disputes and they could make project financing such a facility and finding suitable partners and customers very difficult if we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

we rely on transportation assets and services much of which we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sempra mexico and sempra natural gas also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra mexico and sempra natural gas also rely on specialized ships to transport lng to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities sempra natural gas sempra renewables sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities electricity and other services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative natural gas supplies and lng at thencurrent spot market rates which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

in mexico we own or have interests in electricity generation distribution and transmission facilities natural gas propane and ethane distribution storage and transportation projects and an lng terminal in peru and chile we own or have interests in electricity transmission and distribution facilities and operations developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political legal regulatory and financial risks that vary by country including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could materially reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries we may or may not choose to hedge these risks and any hedges entered into may or may not be effective fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in significantly increased taxes in foreign countries and materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

we discuss litigation related to sempra mexico’s energía costa azul lng terminal and other international energy projects in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

 

other risks 

 

sempra energy has substantial investments and other obligations in businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control 

 

as described above sdge holds a 20percent ownership interest in songs which is operated by edison also sempra natural gas owns a 25percent interest in rockies express a joint venture that operates a natural gas pipeline our investment in rockies express is 340 million at december 31 2014 at december 31 2014 sempra renewables has investments totaling 911 million in several joint ventures to develop and operate renewable generation facilities sempra mexico has a 50percent interest in a joint venture with pemex that operates several natural gas pipelines and propane systems in northern mexico sempra mexico also has a 50percent interest in a renewables wind project in baja california at december 31 2014 these investments total 434 million sempra energy has an investment balance of 71 million at december 31 2014 that reflects remaining distributions expected to be received from the rbs sempra commodities llp rbs sempra commodities partnership as it is dissolved the timing and amount of distributions may be impacted by the matters we discuss related to rbs sempra commodities in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report the failure to collect all or a substantial portion of our remaining investment in the partnership could have a corresponding effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations we continue to make investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control 

 

on october 1 2014 sempra natural gas and its joint venture project partners completed the formation of the cameron lng joint venture cameron lng holdings for their investment in the development construction and operation of the threetrain natural gas liquefaction export facility our equity interest in cameron lng holdings was derived from our contribution of cameron lng to the joint venture at its historical carrying value beginning october 1 2014 cameron lng is no longer wholly owned by sempra natural gas and sempra natural gas accounts for its investment in cameron lng holdings under the equity method at december 31 2014 sempra natural gas’ investment in the joint venture is 1 billion 

 

sempra renewables and sempra natural gas have provided guarantees related to joint venture financing agreements and sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico have provided loans to joint ventures in which they have investments and to other affiliates we discuss the guarantees in notes 4 5 and 15 and affiliate loans in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

we have limited influence over these ventures and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest in addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects we discuss our investments further in notes 3 4 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

market performance or changes in other assumptions could require sempra energy sdge andor socalgas to make significant unplanned contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees a decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans in addition the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors including the assumed rate of return on plan assets employee demographics discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations rates of increase in health care costs levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation an adverse change to any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects

government regulation 

 

 

california state utility regulation 

 

the california utilities are regulated by the california public utilities commission cpuc the california energy commission cec and the california air resources board carb 

 

the california public utilities commission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cpuc also oversees and regulates new products and services including solar energy bioenergy and other forms of renewable energy in addition the cpuc’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety violations 

 

we provide further discussion in notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge is also subject to regulation by the cec which publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based upon these forecasts the cec 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the california utilities’ longterm investment decisions 

 

in 2010 the state of california required certain california electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver 20 percent of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the renewables portfolio standard rps program in december 2011 california senate bill 21x 33 rps program went into effect superseding the previous rps program the 33 rps program requires each california utility to procure 33 percent of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2020 with an average 20 percent required over the threeyear period january 1 2011 through december 31 2013 25 percent by december 31 2016 and 33 percent by december 31 2020 we discuss this requirement as it applies to sdge in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

certification of a generation project by the cec as an eligible renewable energy resource err allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements if such purchase meets the provisions of california senate bill 21x this may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by sempra renewables and sempra mexico particularly from california utilities sempra renewables’ copper mountain solar 1 facility in nevada is certified as an err sempra renewables has 50percent interests in both the copper mountain solar 2 and mesquite solar 1 facilities both of which have err certification sempra renewables has received precertification of the copper mountain solar 3 facility and will submit an application for err certification of each phase as it begins operations we plan to obtain err certification for all of our renewable facilities operating in andor providing power to california as they become operational

licenses and permits 

 

the california utilities obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets some of which may require periodic renewal 

 

our other subsidiaries are also required to obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in the normal course of business some of these permits authorizations and licenses require periodic renewal 

 

sempra mexico and sempra south american utilities obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses for their electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided the concession to operate from the ministerio de energ í a for both chilquinta energ í a’s and luz del sur’s distribution operations is for an indefinite term not requiring renewal 

 

sempra mexico and sempra natural gas obtain licenses and permits for the operation and expansion of lng facilities and the import and export of lng and natural gas 

 

sempra   renewables obtains a number of permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities and in connection with the wholesale distribution of electricity 

 

sempra   natural gas obtains a number of permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities and natural gas storage facilities and pipelines and in connection with the wholesale distribution of electricity 

 

most of the permits and licenses associated with construction and operations within the sempra renewables and sempra natural gas businesses are for periods generally in alignment with the construction cycle or life of the asset and in many cases greater than 20 years we do not anticipate that our ongoing requirement to renew or extend shorter duration permits and licenses would have a material impact to the ongoing operations of these businesses 

 

we describe other regulatory matters in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

  

california natural gas utility operations 

 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers and sdge’s core customers on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others the california utilities’ resource planning natural gas procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters are discussed below we also provide further discussion in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

customers 

 

at december 31 2013 socalgas had 58 million customer meters consisting of approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2013 sdge had approximately 865000 natural gas customer meters consisting of approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial and industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers socalgas’ wholesale customers are primarily other investorowned utilities ious including sdge or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial and industrial customers 

 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the california utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements 

 

in 2013 socalgas added approximately 23000 new connected natural gas customer meters representing an annual growth rate of 04 percent in 2012 it added approximately 18000 new connected meters representing an annual growth rate of 03 percent sdge’s connected natural gas customer meters increased by nearly 5000 in both 2013 and 2012 representing an annual growth rate of 06 percent in both years based on forecasts of new housing starts socalgas and sdge each expects that its new meter annual growth rates in 2014 will be slightly higher than those in 2013 

 

 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

 

socalgas   purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the california utilities’ core customers socalgas purchases natural gas from canada the us rockies and the southwestern us to meet its and sdge’s core customer requirements and maintain pipeline reliability it also purchases some california natural gas production and additional supplies delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

 

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has entered into firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights these contracts expire on various dates between 2014 and 2028 pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company gas transmission northwest pacific gas and electric company pge and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california the ferc regulates the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services 

 

 

natural gas storage 

 

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers the california utilities’ core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas’ storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others including sdge for its noncore customer requirements through an open bid process the storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to purchase and store natural gas when natural gas costs are low usually during the summer thereby reducing purchases when natural gas costs are expected to be higher this program allows customers to better manage their natural gas procurement and transportation needs 

 

 

demand for natural gas 

 

growth in the demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products environmental regulations renewable energy legislation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs external factors such as weather the price of electricity the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price which may in turn impact demand 

 

the california utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on customers’ preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products in the noncore industrial market some customers are capable of securing alternate fuel supplies from other suppliers which can affect the demand for natural gas the california utilities’ ability to maintain their respective industrial market shares is largely dependent on the relative price spread between delivered natural gas and potential fuel alternatives such as propane 

 

natural gas demand for electric generation within southern california competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the growth in renewable generation the addition of more efficient gas technologies and to the extent that regulatory changes and electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the california utilities’ respective service areas the demand may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources we provide additional information regarding the electric industry in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and revenues generally are greater during the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry socalgas injects natural gas into storage during the summer months usually april through october for withdrawal from storage during the winter months usually november through march when customer demand is higher 

 

 

electric utility operations 

 

 

sdge 

 

 

customers 

 

sdge’s service area covers 4100 square miles at december 31 2013 sdge had 14 million electric customer meters consisting of approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sdge’s active electric customer meters increased by approximately 7000 in both 2013 and 2012 representing annual growth rates of 05 percent in both years based on forecasting of new housing starts sdge expects that its new meter annual growth rate in 2014 will be slightly higher than the growth in 2013 

 

resource planning and power procurement 

 

sdge’s resource planning power procurement and related regulatory matters are discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

electric resources 

 

the supply of electric power available to sdge for resale is based on cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts currently in place with its various suppliers its wholly owned generating facilities and purchases on a spot basis this supply as of december 31 2013 is as follows 

 

 

  

charges under most of the contracts with qfs are based on sdge’s avoided cost charges under the remaining contracts are for firm and asgenerated energy and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity the prices under these contracts are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated 

 

 

natural gas supply 

 

sdge buys natural gas under shortterm contracts for its palomar miramar desert star and cuyamaca peak generating facilities and for the otay mesa energy center llc orange grove energy lp el cajon energy llc and escondido energy center llc tolling contracts purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices sdge’s natural gas is typically delivered from southern california border receipt points to the socal citygate pool via backbone transmission system rights which expire on september 30 2014 the natural gas is then delivered to the generating facilities through socalgas’ and sdge’s pipeline systems in accordance with a transportation agreement that expires on may 31 2015 sdge has also contracted with socalgas for natural gas storage through march 31 2014

electric resources 

 

the supply of electric power available to luz del sur comes from power purchase contracts currently in place with various suppliers as well as purchases made on a spot basis this supply as of december 31 2013 is as follows 

 

 

 

  

power generation system 

 

the sistema eléctrico interconectado nacional sein is the peruvian national interconnected system peru also has several isolated regional and smaller systems that provide electricity to specific areas the osinergmin is an autonomous public regulatory entity that controls and enforces compliance with legal and technical regulations related to electric activities sets tariffs and supervises the bidding processes required by distribution companies to purchase energy from generators 

the   committee of economic operation of the national interconnected system comité de operación económica del sistema interconectado nacional or   coes coordinates the operation and dispatch of electricity of the sein and manages the shortterm market the coes oversees generation transmission and distribution companies as well unregulated customers with a demand higher than 200 kw 

 

transmission system and access 

 

transmission lines in peru are divided into principal and secondary systems the principal system lines are accessible by all generators and allow the flow of energy through the national grid the secondary system lines connect principal transmission with the network of distribution companies or connect directly to certain final customers the transmission company receives tariff revenues and collects tolls based on a charge per unit of electricity 

 

 

rates and regulation – utilities 

 

we provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to our utilities in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

sempra international and sempra us gas  power 

 

sempra international and sempra us gas  power contain most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to california utility regulation in addition to the discussion of our south american utilities above we provide descriptions of these operating units’ segments and information concerning their operations in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 3 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

competition 

 

sempra energy’s nonutility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar services they are engaged in highly competitive activities that require significant capital investments and highly skilled and experienced personnel among these competitors there may be significant variation in financial personnel and other resources compared to sempra international and sempra us gas  power 

 

generation – renewables 

 

sempra renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity through its development of and investments in wind and solar generation facilities for sales of noncontracted renewable energy sempra renewables competes with other nonutility generators regulated utilities unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy service companies the number and type of competitors may vary based on location generation type and project size also recently enacted regulatory initiatives designed to enhance energy consumption from renewable resources for regulated utility companies may increase competition from these types of institutions these utilities may have a lower cost of capital than most independent renewable power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms this recovery allows them to build buy and upgrade renewable generation projects without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments additionally generation from sempra renewables’ renewable energy assets is exposed to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind inclement weather and hours of sunlight 

 

our renewable energy competitors include among others 

 

 

  

  

generation – natural gas 

 

for sales of noncontracted power sempra natural gas is subject to competition from energy marketers utilities industrial companies and other independent power producers for a number of years natural gas has been the fuel of choice for new power generation facilities for economic operational and environmental reasons while natural gasfired facilities will continue to be an important part of the nation’s generation portfolio some regulated utilities are now constructing units powered by renewable resources often with subsidies or under legislative mandate these utilities may have a lower cost of capital than most independent power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms this recovery may allow them to build buy and upgrade generation without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments 

 

when sempra natural gas sells power not subject to longterm contractual commitments it is exposed to market fluctuations in prices based on a number of factors including the amount of capacity available to meet demand the price and availability of fuel and the presence of transmission constraints some of our competitors such as electric utilities and generation companies have their own generation capacity including natural gas coal and nuclear generation these companies generally larger than our segments engaged in the natural gas business may have a lower cost of capital and may have competitive advantages as a result of their scale and the location of their generation facilities in january 2014 management approved a plan to market and sell sempra natural gas’ remaining generation asset a 625mw block of the mesquite power natural gasfired power plant in arizona as we discuss in note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

our natural gas generation competitors include among others 

 

 

  

  

because sempra mexico sells the power that it generates at its termoeléctrica de mexicali plant into california it is also impacted by these competitive factors 

 

natural gas pipelines and storage facilities 

 

within its market area sempra natural gas’ and sempra mexico’s pipelines businesses and sempra natural gas’ storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines they compete primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets 

 

sempra natural gas’ competitors include among others 

 

 

  

  

sempra mexico’s natural gas pipeline competitors include among others 

 

 

  

  

lng 

 

technological advances associated with shale gas and tight oil production have reduced the forecasted need for north american lng import facilities and increased interest in liquefaction and export opportunities 

 

at current forward gas prices brownfield us gulf coast liquefaction appears to be among the most price competitive potential lng supply in the world its price competitiveness results from many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is expected that global lng competition primarily from canada russia east africa and australia will limit us lng exports as international liquefaction projects attempt to match us gulf coast lng production costs host governments for international liquefaction projects are altering fiscal and tax regimes in an effort to make projects in their jurisdictions competitive relative to us projects it is expected that united states lng exports will greatly increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand and thereby facilitate development of a global commodity market for natural gas 

 

sempra natural gas is currently progressing with plans for a development project to utilize its cameron lng receipt terminal for the liquefaction of natural gas and export of lng sempra natural gas has signed longterm contracts for liquefaction services that allow us to fully utilize our existing regasification infrastructure while minimizing our future additional capital investment the liquefaction facility will utilize cameron lng’s existing facilities including two marine berths three lng storage tanks and vaporization capability of 15 billion cubic feet bcf per day in january 2012 the doe approved cameron lng’s application for authorization to export lng to free trade agreement fta countries in february 2014 the doe issued a conditional authorization to export lng to countries that do not have an fta with the us 

 

in may 2013 cameron lng signed a joint venture agreement with its liquefaction customers affiliates of gdf suez sa mitsubishi corporation through a related company jointly established with nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha nyk and mitsui  co ltd subject to a final investment decision finalization of permit authorizations securing financing commitments and other conditions these customers compete globally to market and sell lng to end users including gas and electric utilities located in lng importing countries around the world by providing liquefaction services cameron lng would compete indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global lng market in addition to the us these competitors are located in the middle east southeast asia africa south america australia and europe 

 

our planned lng liquefaction business’ major domestic and international competitors include among others the following companies and their related lng affiliates 

 

 

 

  

environmental matters 

 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions 

 

 

hazardous substances 

 

in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allowing california’s ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the california utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the california utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates 

 

at december 31 2013 we had accrued estimated remaining investigation and remediation liabilities of 55 million at sdge and 151 million at socalgas both related to hazardous waste sites for which the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism applies as described above the accruals include costs for numerous locations most of which had been manufacturedgas plants at socalgas this estimated cost excludes remediation costs of 01 million associated with sdge’s former fossilfuel power plants and other locations for which the cleanup costs are not being recovered in rates we believe that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial condition of sempra energy sdge or socalgas 

 

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets 

 

 

air and water quality 

 

the electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent airquality and greenhouse gas standards such as those established by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the carb we discuss these standards in “government regulation – california state utility regulation” above the california utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards 

 

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other owners of songs have an agreement with the california coastal commission ccc to mitigate environmental impacts to the marine environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs during its operation songs’ early retirement described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report does not reduce sdge’s mitigation obligation sdge’s share of the mitigation costs is estimated to be 57 million of which 43 million had been incurred through december 31 2013 and 14 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050 artificial kelp reef fish hatchery and wetlands restoration projects are complete but continue to be studied until the ccc accepts the projects the remaining costs are to meet ccc acceptance requirements and maintain the projects through 2050

 item 1a risk factors 

 

when evaluating our company and its subsidiaries you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report these risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf we may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of the following occurs our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially negatively impacted in addition the trading prices of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning   our company set forth in the annual report including without limitation the information set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this section when we state that a risk or uncertainty may could or will have a “material adverse effect” on us or may could or will materially adversely affect us we mean that the risk or uncertainty may could or will have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition prospects andor the trading prices of our securities 

 

sempra energy’s cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and the ability to utilize the cash flows from those subsidiaries 

 

sempra energy’s ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own expenditures and longterm debt obligations in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including without limitation as a result of legislation regulation court order contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress 

 

a significant portion of our worldwide cash reserves are generated by and therefore held in foreign jurisdictions some jurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the united states or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash which reduces the cash available to us to the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in or is needed by our united states operations we may incur significant taxes andor penalties to repatriate these funds 

 

conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us 

 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and refund outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations 

 

the credit markets and financial services industry have experienced periods of extreme worldwide turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of many financial institutions and by extraordinary levels of government intervention and regulation 

 

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments in difficult credit markets we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support business activities this could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of funding both of which could significantly reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability 

 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings if the credit ratings of socalgas or sdge were to be reduced their cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and any reduction in sempra energy’s credit ratings could materially adversely affect the cash flows and results of operations of sempra energy and its nonutility subsidiaries if the credit ratings of sempra energy or its nonutility subsidiaries were to decline especially below investment grade financing costs and borrowings would likely increase because certain counterparties may require collateral in the form of cash a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

 

sempra energy has substantial investments in mexico and south america which expose us to foreign currency legal tax economic and management oversight risk 

 

our for eign operations pose complex management foreign currency legal tax and economic risks which we may not be able to fully mitigate with our actions we have foreign operations in mexico and south america these risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic businesses our international businesses are sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers and to geopolitical uncertainties which may be driven by changes in threat environments and potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions various regional and local economic and political factors risks and uncertainties as well as us foreign policy foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our revenue costs or cash flows from our international operations which could materially adversely affect our financial performance our primary currency exposures are to the latin america currencies our primary objective in reducing foreign currency risk is to preserve the economic value of our foreign investments and to reduce earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations we may attempt to offset material crosscurrency transactions and earnings exposure through various means including financial instruments and shortterm investments because we generally do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries we are susceptible to volatility in other comprehensive income caused by exchange rate fluctuations 

 

 

risks related to all sempra energy subsidiaries 

 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation 

 

in recent years the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on both federal and state levels these changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses moreover existing regulations laws and tariffs may be revised or reinterpreted and new regulations laws and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities special tariffs may also be imposed on components used in our businesses that could increase costs 

 

our businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements and the regulations laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs and new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations could materially adversely affect our tax expense changes in regulations laws and tariffs and changes in the way regulations laws and tariffs are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the california utilities and other sempra energy operations these rules are commonly referred to as the affiliate transaction rules these businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas or to trade with the california utilities and with each other affiliate transaction rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the california utilities any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the lng terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or other operations of our subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor prospects 

 

our businesses require numerous permits licenses and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies any failure to obtain or maintain required permits licenses or approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

all of our existing and planned development projects require multiple approvals the acquisition construction ownership and operation of lng terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and electric generation and transmission facilities require numerous permits licenses certificates and other approvals from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies once received approvals may be subject to litigation and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed in litigation in addition permits licenses certificates and other approvals may be modified or rescinded by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or failure to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities or we may be forced to incur additional costs any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain the necessary permits licenses certificates and other approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

our california utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as the utility reform network turn utility consumers’ action network ucan and other stakeholder and advocacy groups operations that may be influenced by these groups include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

 

our businesses   are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection including in particular climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees in addition we are generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our electric generation facilities and other energy projects regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown our facilities are subject to regulations protecting migratory birds which have recently been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to wind farms failure to comply with applicable environmental laws may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines andor significant curtailments of our operations which could materially adversely affect our cash flows andor results of operations 

 

the scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations including their effects on our current operations and future expansions are difficult to predict increasing international national regional and statelevel concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions including carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations the implementation of recent and proposed california and federal legislation and regulation may materially adversely affect our unregulated businesses by imposing among other things additional costs associated with emission limits controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits similarly the california utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates even if recoverable the effects of existing and proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth sdge may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

 

in addition existing and future laws and regulation on mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates or other emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees and taxes that could materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows 

 

we provide further discussion of these matters in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

severe weather conditions natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism because we are in the business of using storing transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials as well as radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment the risk to our facilities and infrastructure as well as the risks to the surrounding communities is substantially greater than a typical business such facilities and infrastructure include but are not limited to 

 

 

  

such incidents could result in severe business disruptions significant decreases in revenues andor significant additional costs to us any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires leaks radioactive releases explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties or cause personal injuries or fatalities any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us in some cases we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault and in cases where the concept of inverse condemnation applies we may be liable for damages without being found to be at fault or to have been negligent insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become unavailable for certain of these risks and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

severe weather conditions may also impact our businesses on january 17 2014 the governor of california declared a state of emergency because of severe drought conditions in the state the drought conditions in california and the western united states increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires in sdge’s and socalgas’ service territories which could place our electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy the drought conditions also reduce the amount of power available from hydroelectric generation facilities in the northwest united states which could adversely impact the availability of a reliable energy supply into the california electric grid managed by the california iso if alternate supplies of electric generation are not available to replace the lower level of power available from hydroelectric generation facilities this could result in temporary power shortages in sdge’s service territory 

 

our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against us 

 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and arbitration proceedings we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and proceedings and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings we discuss these proceedings in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report the uncertainties inherent in lawsuits arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition california juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part from our customers which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations andor financial condition 

 

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices in addition for those contract positions that are hedged our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned 

 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng electric generation capacity and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

 

in addition certain of the contracts we use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for that contract in certain cases these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged 

 

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

 

although we have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by our businesses or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

 

the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees 

 

several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a facilitybyfacility basis 

 

any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions these potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

 

new business technologies present a risk for attacks on our information systems and the integrity of our energy grid 

 

cybersecurity and the protection of our operations and activities are a priority at sempra energy sdge and socalgas we believe that the most significant cybersecurity risks to our businesses reside within the operations of our utilities in addition to general information and cyber risks that all fortune 500 corporations face eg malware malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces new cybersecurity risks associated with automated metering virtually all of our sdge customers have such metering and socalgas is in the process of converting its customers to such metering and with smart grid infrastructure deployment of these new business technologies represents a new and largescale opportunity for attacks on the utilities’ information systems and more importantly on the integrity of the energy grid while our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks to date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across sempra energy’s businesses but we cannot ensure that a successful attack will not occur an attack to our information systems the integrity of the energy grid or one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects in addition in the ordinary course of business sempra energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees customer energy usage and other information the theft damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws subject us to claims from third parties require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations and harm our reputation 

 

our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change 

 

we expect that new technologies will emerge that may be superior to or may not be compatible with some of our existing technologies and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes in a costeffective manner and to offer on a timely basis services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards if we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence or fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change our businesses operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected examples of technological change that could impact our businesses include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risks related to the california utilities 

 

the california utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may materially adversely affect us 

 

the cpuc regulates the california utilities’ rates except sdge’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates the california utilities’ 

 

 

  

the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows socalgas and sdge may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines and for sdge electric operations under new regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety and new citation programs concerning both gas and electric safety which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the california utilities’ rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

the california utilities may invest a significant amount of money in a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if the project does not receive regulatory approval if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes or if management decides not to proceed with the project they may be unable to recover all amounts invested in that project which could materially adversely affect their financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

the cpuc periodically approves the california utilities’ rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs including income taxes and an authorized rate of return on investment if actual capital expenditures andor operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the cpuc results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected reductions in key benchmark interest rates may trigger automatic adjustment mechanisms which would reduce the california utilities’ authorized rates of return changes in which could materially adversely affect results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

 

the cpuc applies performancebased measures and incentive mechanisms to all california utilities under these earnings potential above authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals rather than relying solely on expanding utility plant rate base to increase earnings at the california utilities the areas that are currently eligible for incentives are operational activities designated by the cpuc energy efficiency programs and at socalgas natural gas procurement and unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services although the california utilities have received incentive awards in the past there can be no assurance that they   will receive awards in the future or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods additionally if the california utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets and other similar matters involving sdge 

 

the california utilities   may be materially adversely affected by new regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how they   operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses 

 

the construction and expansion of the california utilities’ natural gas pipelines socalgas’ storage facilities and sdge’s electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits licenses and other approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies if there are delays in obtaining these approvals or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the california utilities’ businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially adversely affected coordinating these projects so that they are on time and within budget requires competent execution from our employees and contractors cooperation of third parties and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay in the event that one or more of these major projects is delayed or experiences significant cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on the california utilities 

 

natural gas pipeline safety assessments may not be fully or adequately recovered in rates 

 

pending the outcome of various regulatory agency evaluations of natural gas pipeline safety regulations practices and procedures the california utilities may incur substantial incremental expense and capital investment associated with their natural gas pipeline operations and investments in august 2011 socalgas sdge pge and southwest gas filed implementation plans with the cpuc to test or replace all natural gas transmission pipelines that have not been pressure tested in their 2011 filing with the cpuc the california utilities estimated the total cost for phase 1 of the twophase plan to be 31 billion 25 billion for socalgas and 600 million for sdge over a 10year period the california utilities requested that the incremental capital investment required as a result of any approved plan be included in rate base and that cost recovery be allowed for any other incremental cost not eligible for ratebase recovery the costs that are the subject of these plans are outside the scope of the 2012 general rate case or grc proceedings discussed elsewhere in this report if the cpuc were to decide that the incremental capital investment not be considered as incremental rate base outside the grc process or that this incremental capital investment earn a return on rate base lower than what is otherwise authorized or that cost recovery not be allowed for any other incremental cost it could materially adversely affect the respective company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects upon commencement of this program we provide additional information in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the california utilities are subject to increasingly stringent safety standards and the potential for significant penalties if regulators deem either sdge or socalgas to be out of compliance 

 

the california state senate passed legislation in 2013 which requires the cpuc to develop and maintain a safety enforcement program that includes procedures for monitoring data tracking and analysis and investigations as well as delegates citation authority to cpuc staff personnel under the direction of the cpuc executive director this legislation requires the cpuc to implement the enforcement program for natural gas safety by july 1 2014 and for electric safety by january 1 2015 in exercising the citation authority the cpuc staff will take into account voluntary reporting of potential violations voluntary resolution efforts undertaken prior history of violations the gravity of the violation and the degree of culpability the cpuc is planning to adopt an administrative limit on the maximum monetary penalty that may be set by the cpuc staff 

 

in december 2011 the cpuc adopted a natural gas safety citation program whereby natural gas distribution companies can be fined by cpuc staff for violations of the cpuc’s safety standards or federal standards each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense the maximum penalty is 50000 per offense in september 2013 the cpuc issued standard operating procedures setting forth its principles and management process for the gas safety citation program 

 

if the cpuc or its staff determine that either of sdge’s or socalgas’ operations and practices are not in compliance with the safety standards the corrective actions required to be in conformance and any penalties imposed could materially adversely affect the respective company’s cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects upon commencement of this program we provide additional information in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

meaningful rate reform is necessary due to the increased power supply from renewable energy sources and the growth in distributed and local power generation and the failure by the cpuc to reform sdge’s rate structure in a relevant manner could have a material adverse effect on its business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

the current electric rate structure in california places an undue burden on customers with heavy electric use while subsidizing low and moderate use customers in addition customers who selfgenerate their own power primarily solar installations currently do not pay most transmission and distribution charges subject to certain limitations as more heavy use customers purchase solar panels or obtain local offthegrid sources of power the burden on the remaining heavy use customers increases which in turn encourages more selfgeneration and increases rate pressures in addition the increase of solar and other local offthegrid sources of power adversely impacts the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system over the mid to longterm this rate structure is unsustainable on january 1 2014 ab 327 became effective this new law restores to the cpuc the authority to establish electric rates for electric utility companies in california and removes the rate caps established in ab 1x adopted in early 2001 during california’s energy crisis as well as senate bill 695 adopted in 2009 additionally the law provides the cpuc with the authority to adopt up to a 1000 monthly fixed charge for all residential customers effective january 1 2015 the cpuc will implement ab 327 through its current order instituting rulemaking proceeding regarding electric rate reform if the cpuc fails to reform rate structures to maintain competitive and affordable electric rates and the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

recovery of 2007 wildfire litigation costs requires future regulatory approval 

 

sdge is seeking to recover in rates its reasonably incurred costs of resolving 2007 wildfire claims in excess of its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties through december 31 2013 sdge’s costs to settle these claims and its estimated future settlement costs and defense costs are approximately 24 billion which exceeds its 11 billion of liability insurance coverage and the approximately 824 million recovered from third parties sdge has concluded that it is probable that sdge will be permitted to recover a substantial portion of these excess costs in rates and at december 31 2013 sempra energy’s and sdge’s consolidated balance sheets include assets of 330 million in other regulatory assets of which 315 million is related to cpucregulated operations and 15 million is related to fercregulated operations with respect to these excess costs however recovery of these amounts in rates will require future regulatory approval 

 

in august 2009 sdge and socalgas filed an application with the cpuc proposing a new mechanism for the future recovery of wildfirerelated expenses for claims litigation expenses and insurance premiums that are in excess of amounts authorized by the cpuc for recovery in distribution rates in december 2012 the cpuc issued a final decision that denied the proposed blanket cost recovery framework for the utilities but allowed sdge to maintain its authorized memorandum account enabling sdge to file applications with the cpuc requesting recovery of amounts properly recorded in the memorandum account subject to reasonableness review at a later date for a description of this proceeding and information about 2007 wildfire litigation costs and their recovery see notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge will continue to assess the probability of recovery of these excess wildfire costs in rates should sdge conclude that recovery in rates is no longer probable sdge will record a charge against earnings at the time such conclusion is reached if sdge had concluded that the recovery of regulatory assets related to cpucregulated operations was no longer probable or was less than currently estimated as of december 31 2013 the resulting aftertax charge against earnings would have been up to 186 million in addition in periods following any such conclusion sdge’s earnings will be adversely impacted by increases in the estimated costs to litigate or settle pending wildfire claims 

 

as noted above recovery of excess wildfire costs in rates will require future regulatory approval and a failure to obtain all or a significant portion of the expected recovery or a conclusion that recovery in rates is no longer probable would likely have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s and sdge’s cash flows financial condition andor results of operations in addition if recovery is permitted the collection process may extend over a number of years and sempra energy’s and sdge’s cash flows may be materially adversely affected due to the timing differences between resolution of claims and the recovery in rates we discuss how we assess the probability of recovery of our regulatory assets in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility 

 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california operated by southern california edison company or edison the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities songs’ units 2 and 3 have been shut down since early 2012 and on june 6 2013 edison notified sdge that it had reached a decision to permanently retire songs’ units 2 and 3 and seek approval from the nrc to start the decommissioning activities for the entire facility although the facility will be decommissioned in the future sdge’s ownership interest in songs continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility which include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition sdge maintains two trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission songs up to approximately 33 percent of the trust assets has been generally invested in equity securities which are subject to market fluctuation a decline in the market value of trust assets or an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts could increase the funding requirements for these trusts which in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

ongoing regulatory and maintenance issues at songs may have a material adverse effect on us 

 

songs’ units 2 and 3 have been shut down since early 2012 after a water leak occurred in the unit 3 steam generator since the unscheduled outage started sdge has procured power to ensure a reliable supply of power to meet customers’ needs replacing the power that would have been available had songs been in operation the estimated cost of the purchased replacement power incurred from january 2012 through june 6 2013 the date edison notified sdge of its decision to permanently close songs was approximately 165 million of this total 98 million was incurred in 2012 and has been approved for collection in rates pursuant to prior energy resource recovery account erra proceedings the remaining 67 million represents replacement power costs incurred through june 6 2013 that have not yet been approved for recovery in rates in addition to the estimated cost of the purchased replacement power sdge’s share of songs’ operating costs including depreciation and the return on its investment in songs from january 1 2012 through june 30 2013 was approximately 300 million 

 

in november 2012 the cpuc issued an oii into the songs outage to determine whether sdge should remove from customer rates some or all of the revenue requirement associated with the portion of the facility that was out of service this oii will consolidate most songs issues from related regulatory proceedings and consider the appropriate cost recovery for songs during the shutdown including among other costs the cost of the steam generator replacement project replacement power costs capital expenditures operation and maintenance costs and seismic study costs and the appropriate rate design regarding the recovery of the remaining investment in and any return on the remaining investment in songs from the time the units were taken offline the oii requires that all costs related to songs incurred since january 1 2012 be tracked in memorandum accounts and that all revenues collected since january 1 2012 for recovery of such costs and for the return on sdge’s investment in songs be subject to refund the oii will address the extent to which such revenues if any will be required to be refunded to customers 

 

as a result of edison’s decision to permanently retire songs’ units 2 and 3 and seek approval to start the decommissioning activities of the entire facility sdge has removed the net book value of its investment in songs and established a new regulatory asset in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for regulated entities representing the amount management believes is probable of recovery in future rates as a result of this analysis sempra energy’s and sdge’s financial results for the year ended december 31 2013 include an aftertax loss of 119 million reflected in the regulatory asset to reduce the amount that management believes is probable of recovery in rates in the future to 303 million which is included in other regulatory assets on sempra energy’s and sdge’s consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2013 any failure to recover some or all of this regulatory asset the cost of purchased replacement power of 98 million approved in prior erra proceedings for collection in rates or operating or other costs associated with songs including approximately 184 million of operations and maintenance expenses incurred by sdge since the start of the forced outages or any decision by the cpuc to require refund of revenues collected in recovery of the costs above could materially adversely affect sdge’s and sempra energy’s results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 

should sdge conclude that recovery in rates is different than the amount anticipated or is no longer probable sdge will record an additional charge against earnings at the time such a conclusion is reached which could materially adversely affect sdge’s and sempra energy’s results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 

we discuss songs matters in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

risks related to our sempra international and sempra us gas  power businesses 

 

our businesses are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices and our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks 

 

sempra mexico sempra renewables and sempra natural gas generate electricity that they sell under longterm contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets sempra mexico and sempra natural gas purchase natural gas to fuel their power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy their contractual obligations as part of their risk management strategy they may hedge a substantial portion of their electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage their portfolios which subjects us to the risk that the counterparty to such hedge may be unable to fulfill its obligations such a failure could materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition andor results of operations 

 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for power plants or for lng terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas lng or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions 

 

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated commodities result from multiple factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

when our businesses enter into fixedprice longterm contracts to provide services or commodities they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks 

 

sempra mexico sempra renewables and sempra natural gas generally endeavor to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure however if these contracts are at fixed prices the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures including rising operational costs costs of labor materials equipment and commodities and rising interest rates that affect financing costs we may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects providing for cost escalation providing for direct passthrough of operating costs or entering into hedges however these measures if implemented may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses andor financing costs the failure to so fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled or be completed within budget which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

the acquisition development construction and expansion of lng terminals natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and storage facilities electric generation and transmission facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built 

 

success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be materially adversely affected by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to complete the development of a facility or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of electric generation or natural gas regasification liquefaction and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification liquefaction storage and transmission systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

with respect to our proposed project to add lng export capability at our cameron facility we currently anticipate building a facility consisting of three liquefaction trains with a total nameplate capacity of 135 million tonnes per annum mtpa of lng with an expected export capability of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf per day the anticipated incremental investment in the threetrain liquefaction project subject to final design specifications is estimated to be approximately 6 billion to 7 billion excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs while we have signed commercial development agreements with mitsubishi corporation mitsui  co ltd and a subsidiary of gdf suez sa these agreements only bind the parties to fund certain development costs including design permitting and engineering costs of the proposed project and to negotiate in good faith 20year tolling agreements with respect to 12 mtpa of lng which tolling agreements were executed in may 2013 however the development agreements do not obligate the parties to finance the actual construction of this new facility the joint venture agreement and the three tolling agreements are subject to a final investment decision to proceed by each party finalization of permit authorizations and securing financing commitments as well as other customary conditions if one or more of the parties decides not to move forward with the project or if we are unable to arrange suitable financing the project may be substantially delayed reduced or terminated if the project is terminated we may not recover our share of any project development or other related costs expended and we may be required to write off our share of any such previously capitalized costs in addition this project may be delayed reduced or terminated in the event we are unable to obtain all of the necessary permits licenses and authorizations in a timely manner the anticipated cost of this project is based on a number of assumptions that may prove incorrect and is subject to final design specifications and the ultimate cost could significantly exceed the current estimate of 6 billion to 7 billion of incremental investment excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs customers look at a number of factors when evaluating participation in a project and changes in these factors including global natural gas and lng prices could have an impact on the project going forward prior to our final investment decision and in the event we decide not to proceed with the project these risks could have a material adverse effect on our prospects following our final investment decision and in the event we decide to proceed with the project these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

 

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into or replace expiring longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition 

 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility and we may be unable to sell the power that sempra natural gas’ and sempra mexico’s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

sempra mexico and sempra natural gas utilize their lng terminals by entering into longterm capacity agreements under these agreements customers pay us capacity reservation and usage fees to receive store and regasify the customer’s lng these segments also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified at their terminals for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects also although our cameron lng terminal is not fully contracted for regasification given our current progress on the liquefaction project discussed above we do not expect to contract or sell any additional lng import capacity at the cameron terminal our potential lng suppliers also may be subject to international political and economic pressures and risks which may also affect the supply of lng 

 

sempra mexico’s and sempra natural gas’ natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include our lng facilities a significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

sempra natural gas owns a 25percent interest in rockies express pipeline llc rockies express a partnership that operates a natural gas pipeline the rockies express pipeline rex sempra natural gas and the partnership have agreements for capacity on rex that expire at various dates through 2019 as these agreements expire new contracting activity related to that capacity may not be sufficient to replace the revenues from the expiring agreements 

 

we provide information about these matters in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to so perform we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

our businesses are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements should they fail to so perform we may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition many of our agreements are essential to the conduct and growth of our businesses the failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects finally we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

 

sempra mexico’s and sempra natural gas’ obligations and those of their suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for “force majeure” events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

 

legal actions challenging our property rights could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

we are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties on and adjacent to our lng terminal in mexico as we discuss in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report in the event that we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which our lng terminal is located we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such terminal if we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

we rely on transportation assets and services much of which we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sempra mexico and sempra natural gas also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra mexico and sempra natural gas also rely on specialized ships to transport lng to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities sempra natural gas sempra renewables sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities electricity and other services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative natural gas supplies and lng at thencurrent spot market rates which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

we own or have interests in mexico in electricity generation distribution and transmission facilities natural gas propane and ethane distribution storage and transportation projects and an lng terminal and electricity transmission and distribution businesses in chile and peru developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political legal regulatory and financial risks that vary by country including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could materially reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries we may or may not choose to hedge these risks and any hedges entered into may or may not be effective fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in significantly increased taxes in foreign countries and materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

we discuss litigation related to sempra mexico’s energía costa azul lng terminal and other international energy projects in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

other risks 

 

sempra energy has substantial investments and other obligations in businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control 

 

as described above sdge holds a 20percent ownership interest in songs which is operated by edison also sempra natural gas owns a 25percent interest in rockies express a joint venture that operates a natural gas pipeline our investment in rockies express is 329 million at december 31 2013 rockies express is controlled by tallgrass energy partners which holds a 50percent interest at december 31 2013 sempra renewables has investments totaling 707 million in several joint ventures to develop and operate renewable generation facilities sempra mexico owns a 50percent interest in a joint venture with pemex that operates several natural gas pipelines and propane systems in northern mexico at december 31 2013 this investment is 379 million sempra energy has an investment balance of 73 million at december 31 2013 that reflects remaining distributions expected to be received from the rbs sempra commodities llp rbs sempra commodities partnership as it is dissolved the timing and amount of distributions may be impacted by the matters we discuss related to rbs sempra commodities in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report the failure to collect all or a substantial portion of our remaining investment in the partnership could have a corresponding effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations we continue to make investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control we discuss these investments further in notes 3 4 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sempra natural gas is currently progressing with plans to develop its cameron lng regasification facility for liquefaction capability in a joint venture structure with three partners where we will have 502 percent of the joint venture we discuss these plans further in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—factors influencing future performance” in the annual report 

 

we have limited influence over these and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest in addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects 

 

market performance or changes in other assumptions could require sempra energy sdge andor socalgas to make significant unplanned contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

 

sempra energy sdge and socalgas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees a decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans in addition the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors including the assumed rate of return on plan assets employee demographics discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations rates of increase in health care costs levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation an adverse change to any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects

government regulation 

 

the most significant government regulation affecting sempra energy is the regulation of the california utilities 

 

 

california state utility regulation 

 

the california utilities are regulated by the california public utilities commission cpuc the california energy commission cec and the california air resources board carb 

 

the california public utilities commission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide further discussion in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge is also subject to regulation by the cec which publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based upon these forecasts the cec 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the california utilities’ longterm investment decisions 

 

in 2010 the state of california required certain california electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver 20 percent of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the renewables portfolio standard rps program in december 2011 california senate bill 21x 33 rps program went into effect superseding the previous rps program the 33 rps program requires each california utility to procure 33 percent of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2020 with an average 20 percent required over the threeyear period january 1 2011 through december 31 2013 25 percent by december 31 2016 and 33 percent by december 31 2020 we discuss this requirement as it applies to sdge in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

certification of a generation project by the cec as an eligible renewable energy resource err allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements if such purchase meets the provisions of california senate bill 21x this may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by sempra renewables and sempra mexico particularly from california utilities sempra renewables’ copper mountain solar 1 facility in nevada which includes the 10mw solar facility formerly referred to as el dorado solar is certified as an err sempra renewables has also submitted an application for err certification for their copper mountain solar 2 facility we plan to obtain err certification for all of our renewable facilities operating in andor providing power to california as they become operational 

 

california   assembly bill 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 assigns responsibility to carb for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions the bill requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a department within the california environmental protection agency an organization that reports directly to the governor’s office in the executive branch of california state government we provide further discussion in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

united states utility regulation 

 

the california utilities are also regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc the nuclear regulatory commission nrc and the us department of transportation dot 

 

in the case of sdge the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access rates of return on transmission investment the uniform systems of accounts rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale 

 

in the case of socalgas the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas and the uniform systems of accounts 

 

the nrc oversees the licensing construction and operation of nuclear facilities in the united states including the san onofre nuclear generating station songs in which sdge owns a 20percent interest nrc regulations require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities periodically the nrc requires that newly developed data and techniques be used to reanalyze the design of a nuclear power plant and as a result may require plant modifications as a condition of continued operation we provide further discussion of current songs matters involving the nrc in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the dot has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures applicable for the california utilities’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines the dot has certified the cpuc to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in california 

 

 

state and local regulation within the us 

 

socalgas has natural gas franchises with the 12 counties and 233 cities in its service territory these franchises allow socalgas to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration date some franchises have fixed expiration dates ranging from 2013 to 2062 

 

sdge has 

 

 

 

 

 

these franchises allow sdge to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity andor natural gas most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration dates some natural gas and some electric franchises have fixed expiration dates that range from 2015 to 2037 

 

sempra natural gas also operates mobile gas service corporation mobile gas a natural gas distribution utility serving southwest alabama that is regulated by the alabama public service commission mobile gas has franchise agreements with the two counties and eight cities in its service territory with fixed expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2033 which allow it to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas 

 

sempra renewables has operations or development projects in arizona california colorado hawaii indiana kansas nevada and pennsylvania sempra natural gas develops and operates natural gas storage and related pipeline facilities in alabama louisiana and mississippi operates its mesquite natural gas generation facility in arizona and has marketing operations in texas sempra natural gas also operates willmut gas company willmut gas a natural gas distribution utility serving hattiesburg mississippi and regulated by the mississippi public service commission these entities are subject to state and local laws and to regulations in the states in which they operate 

 

 

other us regulation 

 

in the united states the ferc with ratemaking authority over sales of wholesale power and the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and siting and permitting authority for liquefied natural gas lng terminals regulates sempra renewables’ and sempra natural gas’ operations sempra natural gas also owns an interest in the rockies express pipeline a natural gas pipeline that operates in several states in the united states and is subject to regulation by the ferc we discuss our investment in the pipeline further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the ferc may regulate rates and terms of service based on a costofservice approach or in geographic and product markets determined by the ferc to be sufficiently competitive rates may be marketbased our lng terminal in the united states is subject to marketbased rates and terms of service fercregulated rates at the following businesses are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sempra natural gas is also subject to dot rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety 

 

 

foreign regulation 

 

our sempra mexico segment owns and operates the following in mexico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these operations are subject to regulation by the energy regulatory commission comisión reguladora de energía or cre and by the labor and environmental agencies of city state and federal governments in mexico 

 

sempra south american utilities has two utilities in south america that are subject to laws and regulations in the localities and countries in which they operate chilquinta energía sa including its subsidiaries chilquinta energía is an electric distribution utility serving customers in the cities of valparaiso and viña del mar in central chile luz del sur saa including its subsidiaries luz del sur is an electric distribution utility in the southern zone of metropolitan lima peru these utilities serve primarily regulated customers and their revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the national energy commission comisión nacional de energ í a or cne in chile and the energy and mining investment supervisory body organismo supervisor de la inversión en energía y minería or osinergmin of the national electricity office under the ministry of energy and mines in peru 

 

 

licenses and permits 

 

the california utilities obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets some of which may require periodic renewal 

 

our other subsidiaries are also required to obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in the normal course of business some of these permits authorizations and licenses require periodic renewal 

 

sempra mexico and sempra south american utilities obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses for their electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided the concession to operate from the ministerio de energ í a for both chilquinta energ í a’s and luz del sur’s distribution operations is for an indefinite term not requiring renewal 

 

sempra mexico and sempra natural gas obtain licenses and permits for the operation and expansion of lng facilities and the import and export of lng and natural gas 

 

sempra   renewables obtains a number of permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities and in connection with the wholesale distribution of electricity 

 

sempra   natural gas obtains a number of permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities and natural gas storage facilities and pipelines and in connection with the wholesale distribution of electricity 

 

most of the permits and licenses associated with construction and operations within the sempra renewables and sempra natural gas businesses are for periods generally in alignment with the construction cycle or life of the asset and in many cases greater than 20 years we do not anticipate that our ongoing requirement to renew or extend shorter duration permits and licenses would have a material impact to the ongoing operations of these businesses 

 

we describe other regulatory matters in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

  

california natural gas utility operations 

 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers and sdge’s core customers on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others the california utilities’ resource planning natural gas procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters are discussed below we also provide further discussion in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

customers 

 

at december 31 2012 socalgas had 58 million customer meters consisting of approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2012 sdge had approximately 860000 natural gas customer meters consisting of approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers socalgas’ wholesale customers are primarily other investorowned utilities ious including sdge or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial and industrial customers 

 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the california utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements 

 

in 2012 socalgas added approximately 18000 new connected natural gas customer meters representing an annual growth rate of 03 percent in 2011 it added approximately 15000 new connected meters representing an annual growth rate of 03 percent sdge’s connected natural gas customer meters increased by approximately 5000 in both 2012 and 2011 representing an annual growth rate of 06 percent in both years based on forecasts of new housing starts socalgas and sdge each expects that its new meter annual growth rates in 2013 will be slightly higher than those in 2012

socalgas   purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the california utilities’ core customers socalgas purchases natural gas from canada the us rockies and the southwestern us to meet its and sdge’s core customer requirements and maintain pipeline reliability it also purchases some california natural gas production and additional supplies delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

 

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has entered into firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company gas transmission northwest pacific gas and electric company and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california these contracts expire on various dates between 2013 and 2028 the ferc regulates the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services 

 

 

natural gas storage 

 

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers the california utilities’ core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas’ storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others including sdge for its noncore customer requirements through an open bid process the storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to purchase and store natural gas when natural gas costs are low usually during the summer thereby reducing purchases when natural gas costs are expected to be higher this program allows customers to better manage their natural gas procurement and transportation needs 

 

 

demand for natural gas 

 

growth in the demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products environmental regulations renewable energy legislation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs external factors such as weather the price of electricity electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price which may in turn impact demand 

 

the california utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on customers’ preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products in the noncore industrial market some customers are capable of securing alternate fuel supplies from other suppliers which can affect the demand for natural gas the california utilities’ ability to maintain their respective industrial market shares is largely dependent on the relative spread between delivered energy prices 

 

natural gas demand for electric generation within southern california competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the growth in renewable generation the addition of more efficient gas technologies and to the extent that regulatory changes and electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the california utilities’ respective service areas the demand may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources we provide additional information regarding the electric industry in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and revenues generally are greater during the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry socalgas injects natural gas into storage during the summer months usually april through october for withdrawal from storage during the winter months usually november through march when customer demand is higher

sdge’s active electric customer meters increased by approximately 7000 and 8000 in 2012 and 2011 respectively representing annual growth rates of 05 percent and 06 percent respectively based on forecasting of new housing starts sdge expects the number of active meters to increase in 2013 by approximately 11000 representing a growth rate of 08 percent 

 

  

resource planning and power procurement 

 

sdge’s resource planning power procurement and related regulatory matters are discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

electric resources 

 

the supply of electric power available to sdge for resale is based on cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts currently in place with its various suppliers its wholly owned generating facilities its 20percent ownership interest in songs when songs returns to service and purchases on a spot basis this supply as of december 31 2012 is as follows 

 

 

under the contract with portland general electric company pge sdge pays a capacity charge plus a charge based on the amount of energy received andor pge’s nonfuel costs costs under most of the contracts with qfs are based on sdge’s avoided cost charges under the remaining contracts are for firm and asgenerated energy and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity the prices under these contracts are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated 

 

 

natural gas supply 

 

sdge buys natural gas under shortterm contracts for its palomar miramar desert star and cuyamaca peak generating facilities and for the otay mesa energy center llc orange grove energy lp and el cajon energy llc tolling contracts purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices sdge’s natural gas is typically delivered from southern california border receipt points to the socal citygate pool via backbone transmission system rights which expire on september 30 2014 the natural gas is then delivered to the generating facilities through socalgas’ and sdge’s pipeline systems in accordance with a transportation agreement that expires on may 31 2013 sdge will be executing a new twoyear transportation agreement that will be effective june 1 2013 sdge has also contracted with socalgas for natural gas storage from april 1 2012 to march 31 2014 

 

 

songs 

 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs which is located south of san clemente california songs consists of two operating nuclear generating units the city of riverside owns 179 percent and southern california edison company edison the operator of songs owns the remaining interest of 7821 percent 

 

the two units began commercial operation in august 1983 and april 1984 respectively sdge’s share of the capacity from the two units is 430 mw in 2005 the cpuc authorized a project to install four new steam generators in units 2 and 3 at songs and remove and dispose of their predecessor generators edison completed the installation of these steam generators in 2010 and 2011 for units 2 and 3 respectively in january 2012 a water leak occurred in the unit 3 steam generator which caused it to be shut down edison conducted inspection testing and determined that the water leak was the result of excessive wear from tubetotube contact during a planned maintenance and refueling outage on the unit 2 steam generators in february 2012 inspections found high levels of unexpected wear in some heat transfer tubes of the unit 2 steam generators as of december 31 2012 both units 2 and 3 remain offline the units cannot be restarted until plans have been approved by the nrc in october 2012 edison submitted a restart plan for unit 2 to the nrc unit 3 will remain offline while edison continues to study the potential solutions that are unique to that unit we discuss the current songs outage inspection and repair issues and related regulatory matters in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

a third unit was removed from service in november 1992 decommissioning of that unit is largely complete with the remaining work to be done in the future when the remaining two units are decommissioned its spent nuclear fuel is being stored on site in an independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi licensed by the nrc 

 

sdge has fully recovered the capital it invested in songs through december 31 2003 and earns a return only on subsequent capital additions including sdge’s share of costs associated with the steam generator replacement project completed in 2011 

 

in november 2012 the cpuc issued an order instituting investigation oii into the extended outages of units 2 and 3 the oii requires that all costs related to songs incurred since january 1 2012 be tracked in a separate memorandum account with all revenues collected in recovery of such costs subject to refund and will address the extent to which such revenues if any should be refunded to rate payers 

 

as we discuss in “item 1a risk factors” herein our influence may be limited over businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest including songs we provide additional information concerning the songs units and nuclear decommissioning below in “environmental matters” and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 6 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

nuclear fuel supply 

 

the nuclear fuel supply cycle includes materials and services performed by others under various contracts that extend through 2020 fuel supply contracts are indexpriced and provide nuclear fuel through 2022 the expiration of songs’ nrc license 

 

spent fuel from songs is being stored on site in both the isfsi and spent fuel pools with the completion of the current phase of decommissioning the site has adequate space to build isfsi storage capacity through 2022 pursuant to the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 sdge entered into a contract with the us department of energy doe for spentfuel disposal under the agreement the doe is responsible for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel from songs sdge pays the doe a disposal fee of 100 per megawatthour of net nuclear generation or approximately 3 million per year when songs is operating at normal capacity it is uncertain when the doe will begin accepting spent fuel from any nuclear generation facility 

 

we provide additional information concerning nuclear fuel costs and the storage and movement of spent fuel in notes 6 and 15 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

electric resources 

 

the supply of electric power available to luz del sur comes from power purchase contracts currently in place with various suppliers as well as purchases made on a spot basis this supply as of december 31 2012 is as follows 

 

 

 

  

power generation system 

 

the sistema eléctrico interconectado nacional sein is the peruvian national interconnected system peru also has several isolated regional and smaller systems that provide electricity to specific areas the osinergmin is an autonomous public regulatory entity that controls and enforces compliance with legal and technical regulations related to electric activities sets tariffs and supervises the bidding processes required by distribution companies to purchase energy from generators 

the   committee of economic operation of the system comité de operación económica del sistema interconectado nacional or   coes coordinates the operation and dispatch of electricity of the sein and manages the shortterm market the coes oversees generation transmission and distribution companies as well unregulated customers with a demand higher than 200 kw 

 

transmission system and access 

 

transmission lines in peru are divided into principal and secondary systems the principal system lines are accessible by all generators and allow the flow of energy through the national grid the secondary system lines connect principal transmission with the network of distribution companies or connect directly to certain final customers the transmission company receives tariff revenues and collects tolls based on a charge per unit of electricity 

 

 

rates and regulation – utilities 

 

we provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to our utilities in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

sempra international and sempra us gas  power 

 

sempra international and sempra us gas  power contain most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to california utility regulation in addition to the discussion of our south american utilities above we provide descriptions of these operating units’ segments and information concerning their operations in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 3 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

competition 

 

sempra energy’s nonutility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar products and services they are engaged in highly competitive activities that require significant capital investments and highly skilled and experienced personnel among these competitors there may be significant variation in financial personnel and other resources compared to sempra international and sempra us gas  power 

 

generation – renewables 

 

sempra renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity through its development of and investments in wind and solar generation facilities for sales of noncontracted renewable energy sempra renewables competes with other nonutility generators regulated utilities unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy service companies the number and type of competitors may vary based on location generation type and project size also recently enacted regulatory initiatives designed to enhance energy consumption from renewable resources for regulated utility companies may increase competition from these types of institutions these utilities may have a lower cost of capital than most independent renewable power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms this recovery allows them to build buy and upgrade renewable generation projects without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments additionally generation from sempra renewables’ renewable energy assets is exposed to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind inclement weather and hours of sunlight 

 

our renewable energy competitors include among others 

 

 

  

generation – natural gas 

 

for sales of noncontracted power sempra natural gas is subject to competition from energy marketers utilities industrial companies and other independent power producers for a number of years natural gas has been the fuel of choice for new power generation facilities for economic operational and environmental reasons while natural gasfired facilities will continue to be an important part of the nation’s generation portfolio some regulated utilities are now constructing units powered by renewable resources often with subsidies or under legislative mandate these utilities may have a lower cost of capital than most independent power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms this recovery may allow them to build buy and upgrade generation without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments 

 

when sempra natural gas sells power not subject to longterm contract commitments it is exposed to market fluctuations in prices based on a number of factors including the amount of capacity available to meet demand the price and availability of fuel and the presence of transmission constraints some of our competitors such as electric utilities and generation companies have their own generation capacity including natural gas coal and nuclear generation these companies generally larger than our segments engaged in the natural gas business may have a lower cost of capital and may have competitive advantages as a result of their scale and the location of their generation facilities 

 

our natural gas generation competitors include among others 

 

 

  

because sempra mexico sells the power that it generates at its termoeléctrica de mexicali plant into california it is also impacted by these competitive factors 

 

natural gas pipelines and storage facilities 

 

within its market area sempra natural gas’ and sempra mexico’s pipelines businesses and sempra natural gas’ storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines they compete primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets 

 

sempra natural gas’ competitors include among others 

 

 

  

sempra mexico’s natural gas pipeline competitors include among others 

 

 

  

lng 

 

new supplies to meet north america’s natural gas demand may be developed from a combination of the following sources 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the demand for energy currently met by natural gas could be met by other energy forms such as coal hydroelectric oil wind solar geothermal biomass and nuclear energy our lng businesses will therefore face competition from companies that supply each of these energy sources 

 

from time to time our lng businesses compete with other companies that operate lng receiving terminals purchase and sell lng and purchase and sell natural gas as of december 31 2012 there were 16 existing and operating lng receipt terminals in north america worldwide there are 94 existing and operating lng receipt terminals in 26 countries there are also other proposed lng receipt terminals worldwide with which if developed our lng businesses would compete to be the most economical delivery point for lng supply of both longterm contracted and spot volumes 

 

our current lng businesses’ major domestic and international competitors include among others the following companies and their related lng affiliates 

 

 

  

sempra natural gas is currently progressing with plans for a development project to utilize its cameron lng terminal for the liquefaction of natural gas and export of lng the objective is to obtain longterm contracts for liquefaction services that allow us to fully utilize our existing regasification infrastructure while minimizing our future additional capital investment the liquefaction facility will utilize cameron lng’s existing facilities including two marine berths three lng storage tanks and vaporization capability of 15 billion cubic feet bcf per day in january 2012 the doe approved cameron lng’s application for a license to export lng to free trade agreement fta countries the authorization to export lng to countries with which the us does not have an fta is pending review by the doe 

 

prospective liquefaction customers of cameron lng compete globally to market and sell lng to end users including gas and electric utilities located in lng importing countries around the world by providing liquefaction services to cameron lng’s customers cameron lng would indirectly be competing with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the world lng market these competitors are located in the middle east southeast asia africa south america australia and europe 

 

our planned lng liquefaction business’s major domestic and international competitors include among others the following companies and their related lng affiliates 

 

 

 

  

environmental matters 

 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions 

 

 

hazardous substances 

 

in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allowing california’s ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the california utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the california utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates 

 

at december 31 2012 we had accrued estimated remaining investigation and remediation liabilities of 07 million at sdge and 159 million at socalgas both related to hazardous waste sites for which the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism applies as described above the accruals include costs for numerous locations most of which had been manufacturedgas plants at socalgas this estimated cost excludes remediation costs of 02 million associated with sdge’s former fossilfuel power plants and other locations for which the cleanup costs are not being recovered in rates we believe that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial condition of sempra energy sdge or socalgas 

 

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets 

 

 

air and water quality 

 

the electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent airquality and greenhouse gas standards such as those established by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the carb we discuss these standards in “government regulation – california utility regulation” above the california utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards 

 

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other owners of songs have an agreement with the california coastal commission to mitigate environmental impacts to the marine environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs sdge’s share of the mitigation costs is estimated to be 48 million of which 38 million had been incurred through december 31 2012 and 10 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050 artificial kelp reef fish hatchery and wetlands restoration projects are complete but continue to be studied until the california coastal commission accepts the projects the remaining costs are to maintain the projects through 2050

 item 1a risk factors 

 

when evaluating our company and its subsidiaries you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report these risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf we may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of the following occurs our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially negatively impacted in addition the trading price of our securities could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning   our company set forth in the annual report including without limitation the information set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this section when we state that a risk or uncertainty may could or will have a “material adverse effect” on us or may could or will materially adversely affect us we mean that the risk or uncertainty may could or will have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition prospects andor the market prices of our securities 

 

sempra energy’s cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries 

 

sempra energy’s ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own capital expenditures and longterm debt obligations in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including without limitation as a result of legislation regulation court order contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress 

 

conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us 

 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and refund outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations 

 

the credit markets and financial services industry have experienced a period of extreme worldwide turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of many financial institutions and by extraordinary levels of government intervention and proposals for further intervention and additional regulation 

 

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments in difficult credit markets we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support business activities this could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of funding both of which could significantly reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability 

 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings if the credit ratings of socalgas or sdge were to be reduced their cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and any reduction in sempra energy’s ratings could materially adversely affect the cash flows and results of operations of sempra energy and its nonutility subsidiaries 

 

 

risks related to all sempra energy subsidiaries 

 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation 

 

in recent years the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on both federal and state levels these changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses moreover existing regulations laws and tariffs may be revised or reinterpreted and new regulations laws and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities special tariffs may also be imposed on components used in our businesses that could increase costs if applicable our businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements and the regulations laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs and new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations could materially adversely affect our tax expense changes in regulations laws and tariffs and changes in the way regulations laws and tariffs are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the california utilities and other sempra energy operations these rules are commonly referred to as the affiliate transaction rules these businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas or to trade with the california utilities and with each other affiliate transaction rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the california utilities any such restrictions or approval requirements could materially adversely affect the lng terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or other operations of our subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor prospects 

 

our businesses require numerous permits and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

all of our existing and planned development projects require multiple approvals the acquisition construction ownership and operation of lng terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and electric generation and transmission facilities require numerous permits licenses certificates and other approvals from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies once received approvals may be subject to litigation and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed in litigation in addition permits licenses certificates and other approvals may be modified or rescinded by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities or we may be forced to incur additional costs any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain the necessary permits licenses certificates and other approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

 

we   are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection including in particular climate change and ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees in addition we are generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our electric generation facilities and other energy projects regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws we may be subject to substantial penalties and fines andor significant curtailments of our operations which could materially adversely affect our cash flows andor results of operations 

 

the scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations including their effects on our current operations and future expansions are difficult to predict increasing international national regional and statelevel concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions including carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations the implementation of recent and proposed california and federal legislation and regulation may materially adversely affect our unregulated businesses by imposing among other things additional costs associated with emission limits controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits similarly the california utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates even if recoverable the effects of existing and proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth sdge may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

 

in addition existing and future laws and regulation on mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates or other emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees and taxes that could materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations andor cash flows 

 

we provide further discussion of these matters in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism because we are in the business of using storing transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials as well as radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment the risk to our facilities and infrastructure as well as the risks to the surrounding communities is substantially greater than a typical business such facilities and infrastructure include but are not limited to 

 

 

  

such incidents could result in severe business disruptions significant decreases in revenues andor significant additional costs to us any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires leaks radioactive releases explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties or cause personal injuries or fatalities any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us in some cases we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault and in cases where the concept of inverse condemnation applies we may be liable for damages without being found to be at fault or to have been negligent insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become unavailable for certain of these risks and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

our businesses results of operations financial condition andor cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against us 

 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings in particular sdge is subject to numerous lawsuits arising out of san diego county wildfires in 2007 we discuss these proceedings in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report the uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition california juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part from our customers which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows results of operations andor financial condition 

 

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices in addition for those contract positions that are hedged our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned 

 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng electric generation capacity and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

 

in addition certain of the contracts we use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for that contract in certain cases these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged 

 

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

 

although we have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by the companies or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor financial condition 

 

the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees 

 

several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a facilitybyfacility basis 

 

any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions these potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

 

new business technologies present a risk for attacks on our information systems and the integrity of our energy grid 

 

cybersecurity and the protection of our operations and activities are a priority at sempra energy sdge and socalgas we believe that the most significant cybersecurity risks to our businesses reside within the operations of our utilities in addition to general information and cyber risks that all fortune 500 corporations face eg malware malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces new cybersecurity risks associated with automated metering virtually all of our sdge customers have such metering and socalgas is beginning the process of converting its customers to such metering and with smart grid infrastructure deployment of these new business technologies represents a new and largescale opportunity for attacks on the utilities’ information systems and more importantly on the integrity of the energy grid while addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across sempra energy’s businesses we cannot ensure that a successful attack will not occur such an attack to our information systems the integrity of the energy grid or one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

 

risks related to the california utilities 

 

the california utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may materially adversely affect us 

 

the cpuc regulates the california utilities’ rates except sdge’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates the california utilities’ 

 

 

  

the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows socalgas and sdge may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines under new regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the california utilities’ rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

the california utilities may spend significant amounts of money related to a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if the project does not receive regulatory approval if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes or if management decides not to proceed with the project they may be unable to recover all amounts spent for that project which could materially adversely affect their financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

the cpuc periodically approves the california utilities’ rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs and an authorized rate of return on investment if actual capital expenditures andor operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the cpuc results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects could be materially adversely affected reductions in key benchmark interest rates may trigger automatic adjustment mechanisms which would reduce the california utilities’ authorized rates of return changes in which could materially adversely affect results of operations financial condition cash flows andor prospects as we discuss under “cost of capital” in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the cpuc applies performancebased measures and incentive mechanisms to all california utilities under these earnings potential above authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals rather than relying solely on expanding utility plant rate base to increase earnings at the california utilities the areas that are eligible for incentives are operational activities such as employee safety energy efficiency programs and at socalgas natural gas procurement and unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services although the california utilities have received incentive awards in the past there can be no assurance that they   will receive awards in the future or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods additionally if the california utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets and other similar matters involving sdge 

 

the california utilities   may be materially adversely affected by new regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how they   operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses 

 

the construction and expansion of the california utilities’ natural gas pipelines socalgas’ storage facilities and sdge’s electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits licenses and other approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies if there are delays in obtaining these approvals or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the california utilities’ businesses cash flows results of operations financial condition andor prospects could be materially adversely affected coordinating these projects so that they are on time and within budget requires superior execution from our employees and contractors cooperation of third parties and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay in the event that one or more of these major projects is delayed or experiences significant cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on the california utilities 

 

recovery of 2007 wildfire litigation costs requires future regulatory approval 

 

sdge is subject to numerous lawsuits arising out of the san diego county wildfires in 2007 through december 31 2012 sdge’s costs to settle these claims and its estimated future settlement costs and defense costs are approximately 24 billion exceeding its 11 billion of liability insurance coverage and the approximately 824 million recovered from third parties sdge is seeking to recover in rates its reasonably incurred costs of resolving 2007 wildfire claims in excess of its liability insurance coverage and amounts recovered from third parties sdge has concluded that it is probable that sdge will be permitted to recover a substantial portion of these excess costs in rates and at december 31 2012 sempra energy’s and sdge’s consolidated balance sheets include assets of 364 million in regulatory assets arising from wildfire litigation costs of which 317 million is related to cpucregulated operations and 47 million is related to fercregulated operations with respect to these excess costs however recovery of these amounts in rates will require future regulatory approval 

 

in august 2009 sdge and socalgas filed an application with the cpuc proposing a new mechanism for the future recovery of wildfirerelated expenses for claims litigation expenses and insurance premiums that are in excess of amounts authorized by the cpuc for recovery in distribution rates in december 2012 the cpuc issued a final decision that denied the proposed blanket cost recovery framework for the utilities but allowed sdge to maintain its authorized memorandum account enabling sdge to file applications with the cpuc requesting recovery of amounts properly recorded in the memorandum account subject to reasonableness review at a later date for a description of this proceeding and information about 2007 wildfire litigation costs and their recovery see notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge will continue to assess the probability of recovery of these excess wildfire costs in rates should sdge conclude that recovery in rates is no longer probable sdge will record a charge against earnings at the time such conclusion is reached if sdge had concluded that the recovery of regulatory assets related to cpucregulated operations was no longer probable or was less than currently estimated as of december 31 2012 the resulting aftertax charge against earnings would have been up to 190 million in addition in periods following any such conclusion sdge’s earnings will be adversely impacted by increases in the estimated costs to litigate or settle pending wildfire claims 

 

as noted above recovery of excess wildfire costs in rates will require future regulatory approval and a failure to obtain all or a significant portion of the expected recovery or a conclusion that recovery in rates is no longer probable would likely have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s and sdge’s cash flows financial condition andor results of operations in addition if recovery is permitted the collection process may extend over a number of years and sempra energy’s and sdge’s cash flows may be materially adversely affected due to the timing differences between resolution of claims and the recovery in rates we discuss how we assess the probability of recovery of our regulatory assets in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility 

 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california operated by southern california edison company the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities sdge’s ownership interest in songs subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation which include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

ongoing regulatory and maintenance issues at songs may have a material adverse effect on us 

 

as discussed in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report songs’s units 2 and 3 are offline the timing of the restart of either of these units is dependent upon approval by the nrc which could result in substantial additional expenditures that may not be recoverable in whole or in part in customer rates in november 2012 the cpuc issued an oii into the songs outage to determine whether sdge should remove from customer rates some or all revenue requirement associated with the portion of the facility that is out of service this oii will consolidate all songs issues from related regulatory proceedings and consider the appropriate cost recovery for songs including among other costs the cost of the steam generator replacement project replacement power costs capital expenditures operation and maintenance costs and seismic study costs the oii requires all costs related to songs incurred since january 1 2012 be tracked in newly established memorandum accounts with all revenues collected since january 1 2012 in recovery of such costs and the return on sdge’s investment in songs subject to refund the oii will address the extent to which such revenues if any will be required to be refunded to customers any extended shut down of one or both of these units and the costs required to bring those units back online could materially adversely affect sdge’s and sempra energy’s results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects in addition any decision by the cpuc to require sdge to refund some or all of the revenues collected in recovery of the costs described above could materially adversely affect sdge’s and sempra energy’s results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

 

 

risks related to our sempra international and sempra us gas  power businesses 

 

our businesses are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices and our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks 

 

sempra mexico sempra renewables and sempra natural gas generate electricity that they sell under longterm contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets sempra mexico and sempra natural gas purchase natural gas to fuel their power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy their contractual obligations as part of their risk management strategy they may hedge a substantial portion of their electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage their portfolios which subjects us to the risk that the counterparty to such hedge may be unable to fulfill its obligations such a failure could materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition andor results of operations 

 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for power plants or for lng terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas lng or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions 

 

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated commodities result from multiple factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

when our businesses enter into fixedprice longterm contracts to provide services or commodities we are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks 

 

sempra mexico sempra renewables and sempra natural gas generally endeavor to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure however if these contracts are at fixed prices the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures including rising operational costs costs of labor materials equipment and commodities and rising interest rates that affect financing costs we may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects providing for cost escalation or entering into hedges however these measures if implemented may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses andor financing costs the failure to so fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows andor results of operations 

 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled or be completed within budget which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

the acquisition development construction and expansion of lng terminals natural gas propane and ethane pipelines and storage facilities electric generation and transmission facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built 

 

success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be materially adversely affected by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to complete the development of a facility or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of generation or regasification and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification storage and transmission systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

with respect to our proposed project to add lng export capability at our cameron facility we currently anticipate building a facility consisting of three liquefaction trains with a total nameplate capacity of 135 million tonnes per annum mtpa of lng and expected export capability of 12 mtpa of lng or approximately 17 bcf per day total cost will be approximately 6 billion to 7 billion excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs and subject to final design specifications while we have signed commercial development agreements with mitsubishi corporation mitsui  co and a subsidiary of gdf suez sa these agreements only bind the parties to fund certain development costs including design permitting and engineering costs of the proposed project and to negotiate in good faith 20year tolling agreements with respect to 12 mtpa of lng the development agreements do not obligate the parties to finance the actual construction of this new facility and there can be no assurance that the parties will reach agreement on the terms of the 20year tolling agreements if one or more of the parties decides not to move forward with the project or does not enter into a tolling agreement or if we are unable to arrange suitable financing the project may be substantially delayed reduced or terminated if the project is terminated we may not recover our share of any project development or other related costs expended and may be required to write off our share of any such previously capitalized costs in addition this project may be delayed reduced or terminated in the event we are unable to obtain all of the necessary permits licenses and authorizations in a timely manner if the application to export to nonfta countries is not approved the size of the project may be reduced or the project may be delayed or terminated the anticipated cost of this project is based on a number of assumptions that may prove incorrect and the ultimate cost could significantly exceed the current estimate of 6 billion to 7 billion excluding capitalized interest and other financing costs and subject to final design specifications customers look at a number of factors when evaluating participation in a project and changes in these factors including global natural gas and lng prices could have an impact on the project going forward prior to our final investment decision and in the event we decide not to proceed with the project these risks could have a material adverse effect on our prospects following our final investment decision and in the event we decide to proceed with the project these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

 

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition 

 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility the 10year power sales agreement between sempra natural gas and the dwr which comprised 6 percent of our revenues in 2011 and 8 percent of our revenues in 2010 expired on september 30 2011 as a result we may be unable to sell the power that sempra natural gas’ and sempra mexico’s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

sempra mexico and sempra natural gas utilize their lng terminals by entering into longterm capacity agreements under these agreements customers pay us capacity reservation and usage fees to receive store and regasify the customer’s lng these segments also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified at their terminals for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices however if our lng operations are unable to obtain sufficient longterm agreements or if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows andor prospects our potential lng suppliers also may be subject to international political and economic pressures and risks which may also affect the supply of lng 

 

sempra mexico’s and sempra natural gas’ natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include our lng facilities 

 

we provide information about these matters in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to so perform we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements should they fail to so perform we may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition many of our agreements are essential to the conduct and growth of our businesses the failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects finally we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

 

sempra mexico’s and sempra natural gas’ obligations and those of their suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for “force majeure” events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition andor prospects 

 

legal actions challenging our property rights could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

we are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties on which our lng terminal in mexico is located and our title to the property on which our termoeléctrica de mexicali power generation facility is located in june 2012 the state civil court in mexicali ruled that our title to the property on which our termoeléctrica de mexicali power generation facility is located was invalid due to procedural errors made by our predecessor in title however the court also declined to award title to the claimant and we are appealing the ruling invalidating our title in the event that we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which our lng terminal is located or the property on which our power generation facility is located we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related facility or terminal which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such facility andor terminal if we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related facility or terminal it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows andor prospects 

 

we rely on transportation assets and services much of which we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sempra mexico and sempra natural gas also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra mexico and sempra natural gas also rely on specialized ships to transport lng to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities sempra natural gas sempra renewables sempra south american utilities and sempra mexico rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities electricity and other services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative natural gas supplies at thencurrent spot market rates which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

 

we own or have interests in electricity generation and transmission natural gas distribution and transportation and lng terminal projects in mexico and electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in argentina chile and peru developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political legal regulatory and financial risks that vary by country including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could materially reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in significantly increased taxes in foreign countries and materially adversely affect our cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

 

we discuss litigation related to sempra mexico’s energía costa azul lng terminal termoeléctrica de mexicali power generation facility and other international energy projects in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

other risks

 item 1 business 

 

 

description of business 

 

we provide a description of sempra energy and its subsidiaries in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2011 annual report to shareholders annual report which is attached as exhibit 131 to this report and is incorporated by reference 

 

this report includes information for the following separate registrants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

references in this report to “we” “our” “us” “our company” and “sempra energy consolidated” are to sempra energy and its consolidated entities collectively unless otherwise indicated by the context sdge and socalgas are collectively referred to as the sempra utilities they are subsidiaries of sempra energy and sempra energy indirectly owns all of the common stock and substantially all of the voting stock of each of the two companies 

 

through december 31 2011 sempra energy’s business was organized in five separately managed reportable segments consisting of sdge socalgas sempra generation sempra pipelines  storage and sempra lng liquefied natural gas our disclosures and financial information in this form 10k and annual report reflect these five segments sempra generation sempra pipelines  storage and sempra lng are subsidiaries of sempra global sempra global is a holding company for most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to california utility regulation sempra pipelines  storage also owns utilities which are not included in our references to the sempra utilities we provide financial information about each of these segments and about the geographic areas in which we do business in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

all references in this report to “sempra generation” “sempra pipelines  storage” and “sempra lng” are to the respective principal business units of sempra global and are not intended to refer to any legal entity with the same or similar name 

 

effective january 1 2012 in connection with several key executive appointments made in september 2011 management realigned some of the company’s major subsidiaries to better fit its strategic direction and to enhance the management and integration of our assets this realignment will result in a change in reportable segments in 2012 primarily to regroup the sempra global business units under two new operating units sempra us gas  power and sempra international these operating units will include the following reportable segments 

 

sempra us gas  power 

 

 

 

 

 

sempra international 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sdge and socalgas will continue to be separate reportable segments 

 

 

rbs sempra commodities llp 

 

prior to 2011 our sempra commodities segment contained our investment in rbs sempra commodities llp rbs sempra commodities which held commoditiesmarketing businesses previously owned by us our investment in the partnership is reported on the equity method we and the royal bank of scotland plc rbs our partner in the joint venture sold substantially all of the partnership’s businesses and assets in four separate transactions completed in july november and december of 2010 and february of 2011 we discuss these transactions and other matters concerning the partnership in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the activity in the partnership no longer meets the quantitative thresholds that require sempra commodities to be reported as a reportable segment under applicable accounting rules and we do not consider the remaining winddown activities of the partnership to be of continuing significance as a result effective january 1 2011 we are reporting the former sempra commodities segment in parent and other and have restated prior year information to be consistent with this treatment

government regulation 

 

the most significant government regulation affecting sempra energy is the regulation of the sempra utilities 

 

 

california utility regulation 

 

the sempra utilities are regulated in california by the california public utilities commission cpuc the california energy commission cec and the california air resources board carb 

 

the california public utilities commission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide further discussion in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

sdge is also subject to regulation by the cec which publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based upon these forecasts the cec 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the sempra utilities’ longterm investment decisions 

 

in 2010 the state of california required certain california electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver 20 percent of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the renewables portfolio standard rps program in december 2011 california senate bill 21x 33 rps program went into effect superseding the previous rps program the 33 rps program requires each california utility to procure 33 percent of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2020 with an average 20 percent required over the threeyear period january 1 2011 through december 31 2013 25 percent by december 31 2016 and 33 percent by december 31 2020 we discuss this requirement as it applies to sdge in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

certification of a generation project by the cec as an eligible renewable energy resource err allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements if such purchase meets the provisions of california senate bill 21x this may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by sempra generation particularly from california utilities final certification as an err for sempra generation’s el dorado solar generation facility was approved in june 2009 and for its copper mountain solar 1 facility in nevada in february 2011 

 

california   assembly bill 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 assigns responsibility to carb for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions the bill requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a department within the california environmental protection agency an organization which reports directly to the governor’s office in the executive branch of california state government we provide further discussion in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

united states utility regulation 

 

the sempra utilities are also regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 

 

in the case of sdge the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access rates of return on transmission investment the uniform systems of accounts rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale 

 

in the case of socalgas the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas and the uniform systems of accounts 

 

the nrc oversees the licensing construction and operation of nuclear facilities in the united states including the san onofre nuclear generating station songs in which sdge owns a 20percent interest nrc regulations require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities periodically the nrc requires that newly developed data and techniques be used to reanalyze the design of a nuclear power plant and as a result may require plant modifications as a condition of continued operation 

 

the department of transportation dot has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures applicable for the sempra utilities’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines the dot has certified the cpuc to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in california 

 

 

state and local regulation within the us 

 

socalgas has natural gas franchises with the 12 counties and 233 cities in its service territory these franchises allow socalgas to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration date some franchises have fixed expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2048 

 

sdge has 

 

 

 

 

 

these franchises allow sdge to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity andor natural gas most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration dates some natural gas franchises have fixed expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2035 and some electric franchises have fixed expiration dates that range from 2012 to 2018 

 

sempra generation sempra pipelines  storage and sempra lng have operations or development projects in alabama arizona california colorado hawaii indiana kansas louisiana mississippi nevada pennsylvania and texas these entities are subject to state and local laws and to regulations in the states in which they operate 

 

sempra pipelines  storage operates mobile gas service corporation mobile gas a natural gas distribution utility serving southwest alabama that is regulated by the alabama public service commission sempra pipelines  storage also develops and operates natural gas storage facilities in alabama louisiana and mississippi and is subject to regulation in the states in which the storage facilities are located 

 

 

other us regulation 

 

in the united states the ferc with ratemaking authority over wholesale sales of power and the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and siting and permitting authority for lng terminals regulates sempra generation’s sempra pipelines  storage’s and sempra lng’s operations sempra pipelines  storage also owns an interest in the rockies express pipeline a natural gas pipeline which operates in several states in the united states and is subject to regulation by the ferc 

 

the ferc may regulate rates and terms of service based on a costofservice approach or in geographic and product markets determined by the ferc to be sufficiently competitive rates may be marketbased our lng terminal in the united states is subject to marketbased rates and terms of service fercregulated rates at the following businesses are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sempra pipelines  storage is also subject to dot rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety 

 

 

foreign regulation 

 

several of our segments operate in mexico as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these operations are subject to regulation by the energy regulatory commission comisión reguladora de energía or cre and by the labor and environmental agencies of city state and federal governments in mexico 

 

sempra pipelines  storage also has two utilities in south america that are subject to laws and regulations in the localities and countries in which they operate chilquinta energía sa chilquinta energía is an electric distribution utility serving customers in the cities of valparaiso and viña del mar in central chile luz del sur saa luz del sur is an electric distribution utility in the southern zone of metropolitan lima peru these utilities serve primarily regulated customers and their revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the national energy commission comisión nacional de energ í a or cne in chile and the energy and mining investment supervisory body organismo supervisor de la inversión en energía y minería or osinergmin of the national electricity office under the ministry of energy and mines in peru 

 

 

licenses and permits 

 

the sempra utilities obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets some of which may require periodic renewal 

 

our other subsidiaries are also required to obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in the normal course of business some of these permits authorizations and licenses require periodic renewal 

 

sempra   generation and its subsidiaries obtain a number of permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities and in connection with the wholesale distribution of electricity 

 

sempra pipelines  storage’s mexican and south american subsidiaries obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses for their electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided sempra pipelines  storage’s us operations obtain licenses and permits for natural gas storage facilities and pipelines 

 

sempra lng obtains licenses and permits for the operation and expansion of lng facilities and the import and export of lng and natural gas 

 

we describe other regulatory matters in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

california natural gas utility operations 

 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for itself and sdge on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others the sempra utilities’ resource planning natural gas procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters are discussed below we also provide further discussion in the annual report in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

 

customers 

 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers wholesale customers are primarily other investorowned utilities ious including sdge or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial and industrial customers 

 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the sempra utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements 

 

in 2011 socalgas added 15000 new natural gas customer meters at a growth rate of 03 percent in 2010 it added 24000 new meters at a growth rate of 04 percent sdge’s active natural gas customer meters increased by approximately 5000 and 4300 in 2011 and 2010 respectively representing increases of 06 percent and 05 percent respectively based on forecasts of new housing starts socalgas and sdge each expects that its new meter growth rates in 2012 will be slightly higher than those in 2011 

 

 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

 

socalgas   purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the sempra utilities’ core customers socalgas purchases natural gas from canada the us rockies and the southwestern us to meet customer requirements and maintain pipeline reliability it also purchases some california natural gas production and additional supplies delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices 

 

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has entered into firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company gas transmission northwest pacific gas  electric company and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california the ferc regulates the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services 

 

socalgas has natural gas transportation contracts with various interstate pipelines these contracts expire on various dates between 2012 and 2027 

 

 

natural gas storage 

 

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers the sempra utilities’ core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas’ storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others through an open bid process the storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to purchase and store natural gas when natural gas costs are low usually during the summer thereby reducing purchases when natural gas costs are expected to be higher this program allows customers to better manage their natural gas procurement and transportation needs 

 

 

demand for natural gas 

 

growth in the demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products environmental regulations renewable energy legislation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs external factors such as weather the price of electricity electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price which may in turn impact demand 

 

the sempra utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on customers’ preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products in the noncore industrial market some customers are capable of securing alternate fuel supplies from other suppliers which can affect the demand for natural gas the sempra utilities’ ability to maintain their respective industrial market shares is largely dependent on the relative spread between delivered energy prices 

natural gas demand for electric generation within southern california competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the growth in renewable generation the addition of more efficient gas technologies and to the extent that regulatory changes and electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the sempra utilities’ respective service areas the demand may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources we provide additional information regarding the electric industry in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and revenues generally are greater during the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry socalgas injects natural gas into storage during the summer months usually april through october for withdrawal from storage during the winter months usually november through march when customer demand is higher

sdge’s resource planning power procurement and related regulatory matters are discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

electric resources 

 

the supply of electric power available to sdge for resale is based on cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts currently in place with its various suppliers its fully owned generating facilities its 20percent ownership interest in songs and purchases on a spot basis this supply as of december 31 2011 is as follows 

 

  

under the contract with pge sdge pays a capacity charge plus a charge based on the amount of energy received andor pge’s nonfuel costs costs under most of the contracts with qfs are based on sdge’s avoided cost charges under the remaining contracts are for firm and asavailable energy and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity the prices under these contracts are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated 

 

 

natural gas supply 

 

sdge buys natural gas under shortterm contracts for its palomar miramar desert star and cuyamaca peak generating facilities and for the otay mesa energy center llc orange grove energy lp and el cajon energy llc tolling contracts purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bidweek indices sdge’s natural gas is typically delivered from southern california border receipt points to the socal citygate pool via backbone transmission system rights which expire on september 30 2014 the natural gas is then delivered from the socal citygate pool to the generating facilities through socalgas’ pipelines in accordance with a transportation agreement that expires on may 31 2012 sdge has also contracted with socalgas for natural gas storage from april 1 2011 to march 31 2012 

 

sdge also buys natural gas as the california dwr’s limited agent for the dwrallocated contracts most of the natural gas deliveries for the dwrallocated contracts are transported through the kern river gas transmission pipeline under a longterm transportation agreement the dwr is financially responsible for the costs of gas and transportation 

 

 

songs 

 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs which is located south of san clemente california songs consists of two operating nuclear generating units the city of riverside owns 179 percent and southern california edison company edison the operator of songs owns the remaining interest 

 

the two units began commercial operation in august 1983 and april 1984 respectively sdge’s share of the capacity from the two units is 430 mw 

 

a third unit was removed from service in november 1992 decommissioning of that unit is largely complete with the remaining work to be done in the future when the remaining two units are decommissioned its spent nuclear fuel is being stored on site in an independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi licensed by the nrc 

 

sdge has fully recovered the capital invested through december 31 2003 in songs and earns a return only on subsequent capital additions including sdge’s share of costs associated with the steam generator replacement project completed in 2011 

 

we provide additional information concerning the songs units and nuclear decommissioning below in “environmental matters” and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 6 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

nuclear fuel supply 

 

the nuclear fuel supply cycle includes materials and services performed by others under various contracts that extend through 2020 fuel supply contracts are indexpriced and provide nuclear fuel through 2022 the expiration of songs’ nrc license 

 

spent fuel from songs is being stored on site in both the isfsi and spent fuel pools with the completion of the current phase of decommissioning the site has adequate space to build isfsi storage capacity through 2022 pursuant to the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 sdge entered into a contract with the us department of energy doe for spentfuel disposal under the agreement the doe is responsible for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel from songs sdge pays the doe a disposal fee of 100 per megawatthour of net nuclear generation or 3 million per year it is uncertain when the doe will begin accepting spent fuel from any nuclear generation facility 

 

we provide additional information concerning nuclear fuel costs and the storage and movement of spent fuel in notes 6 and 15 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

in chile customers are also classified as regulated and nonregulated customers depending on consumption regulated customers are those whose consumption is less than 500 kw nonregulated customers are those whose consumption is greater than 2000 kw customers with consumption between 500 kw and 2000 kw may choose to be classified as regulated or nonregulated nonregulated customers can buy power from other sources such as directly from the generator 

 

in 2011 chilquinta energía added 16000 new customers at a growth rate of three percent chilquinta energía expects that its customer growth rate in 2012 will be comparable to that in 2011 

 

 

electric resources 

 

the supply of electric power available to chilquinta energía comes from power purchase contracts currently in place with its various suppliers and its generating facilities this supply as of december 31 2011 is as follows 

 

 

 

power generation system 

 

the centers for economic load dispatch centros de despacho económico de carga or cdec are private organizations in charge of coordinating the operation of the electricity system each interconnected system is subject to its own cdec hence there is a cdecsic sistema interconectado central central interconnected system and cdecsing sistema interconectado del norte grande northern interconnected system for the central and the northern interconnected system respectively chilquinta energía operates within cdecsic 

 

 

transmission system and access 

 

chile’s transmission system is divided into two parts main transmission sistema de transmisión troncal and the subtransmission sistema de subtransmisión in chile main transmission lines must be greater than or equal to 220 kv chilquinta energía uses the company transelec for all of its main transmission in general subtransmission systems operate at voltage levels greater than 23 kv and lower than or equal to 110 kv subtransmission systems including those owned by chilquinta energía are comprised of infrastructure that is interconnected to the electricity system and geared exclusively toward supplying nonregulated or regulated endusers located in the distribution service area

in peru customers are also classified as regulated and nonregulated customers depending on consumption regulated customers are those whose consumption is less than 200 kw and their energy supply is considered public service customers with consumption between 200 kw and 2500 kw may choose to be classified as regulated or nonregulated 

 

in 2011 luz del sur added 35000 new customers at a growth rate of four percent luz del sur expects that its customer growth rate in 2012 will be comparable to that in 2011 

 

 

electric resources 

 

the supply of electric power available to luz del sur comes from power purchase contracts currently in place with various suppliers as well as purchases made on a spot basis this supply as of december 31 2011 is as follows 

 

 

 

power generation system 

 

the sistema eléctrico interconectado nacional sein is the peruvian national interconnected system peru also has several isolated regional and smaller systems that provide electricity to specific areas the osinergmin is an autonomous public regulatory entity that controls and enforces compliance with legal and technical regulations related to electrical activities sets tariffs and supervises the bidding processes required by distribution companies to purchase energy from generators 

the   committee of economic operation of the system comité de operación económica del sistema interconectado nacional or   coes coordinates the operation and dispatch of electricity of the sein and manages the shortterm market the coes oversees generation transmission and distribution companies as well unregulated customers with a demand higher than 200 kw 

 

transmission system and access 

 

transmission lines in peru are divided into principal and secondary systems the principal system lines are accessible by all generators and allow the flow of energy through the national grid the secondary system lines connect principal transmission with the network of distribution companies or connect directly to certain final customers the transmission company receives tariff revenues and collects tolls based on a charge per unit of electricity 

 

 

rates and regulation – utilities 

 

we provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to the sempra utilities and sempra pipelines  storage’s utilities in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

sempra global 

 

sempra global is a holding company for most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to california utility regulation sempra global includes sempra generation sempra pipelines  storage and sempra lng in addition to the discussion of sempra pipelines and storage’s south american utilities above we provide descriptions of these business units and information concerning their operations under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in notes 1 3 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

competition 

 

sempra energy’s nonutility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar products and services they are engaged in highly competitive activities that require significant capital investments and highly skilled and experienced personnel many of their competitors may have significantly greater financial personnel and other resources than sempra global 

 

sempra generation 

 

for sales of noncontracted power sempra generation is subject to competition from energy marketers utilities industrial companies and other independent power producers for a number of years natural gas has been the fuel of choice for new power generation facilities for economic operational and environmental reasons while natural gasfired facilities will continue to be an important part of the nation’s generation portfolio some regulated utilities are now constructing units powered by renewable resources often with subsidies or under legislative mandate these utilities may have a lower cost of capital than most independent power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms this recovery allows them to build buy and upgrade generation without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments 

 

when sempra generation sells power not subject to longterm contract commitments it is exposed to market fluctuations in prices based on a number of factors including the amount of capacity available to meet demand the price and availability of fuel and the presence of transmission constraints additionally generation from sempra generation’s renewable energy assets is exposed to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind weather and hours of sunlight some of sempra generation’s competitors such as electric utilities and generation companies have their own generation capacity including natural gas coal and nuclear generation these companies generally larger than sempra generation may have a lower cost of capital and may have competitive advantages as a result of their scale and the location of their generation facilities 

 

sempra generation’s competitors include 

 

 

 

sempra pipelines  storage 

 

within its market area sempra pipelines  storage’s natural gas storage facilities and pipelines compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines it competes primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and connections to downstream markets 

 

sempra pipelines  storage’s competitors include 

 

 

 

sempra lng 

 

new supplies to meet north america’s natural gas demand may be developed from a combination of the following sources 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the demand for energy currently met by natural gas could be met by other energy forms such as coal hydroelectric oil wind solar geothermal biomass and nuclear energy sempra lng will therefore face competition from companies that supply each of these energy sources 

 

sempra lng currently competes with other companies that operate lng receiving terminals and purchase and sell lng as of december 31 2011 there were 14 existing and operating lng receipt terminals in north america there is one additional lng receipt terminal currently under construction in north america worldwide there are 87 existing and operating lng receipt terminals in 25 countries there are also other proposed lng receipt terminals worldwide with which if developed sempra lng would compete to be the most economical delivery point for lng supply of both longterm contracted and spot volumes 

 

 

sempra lng’s major domestic and international competitors include the following companies and their related lng affiliates 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions 

 

 

hazardous substances 

 

in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allowing california’s ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the sempra utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the sempra utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates 

 

at december 31 2011 we had accrued estimated remaining investigation and remediation liabilities of 06 million at sdge and 234 million at socalgas both related to hazardous waste sites for which the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism authorizes us to recover 90 percent of the costs the accruals include costs for numerous locations most of which had been manufacturedgas plants this estimated cost excludes remediation costs of 1 million associated with sdge’s former fossilfuel power plants and other locations for which the cleanup costs are not being recovered in rates we believe that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial condition of sempra energy sdge or socalgas 

 

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets 

 

 

air and water quality 

 

the electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent airquality and greenhouse gas standards such as those established by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the carb we discuss these standards in “government regulation – california utility regulation” above the sempra utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards 

 

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other owners of songs have an agreement with the california coastal commission to mitigate environmental impacts to the marine environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs sdge’s share of the mitigation costs is estimated to be 55 million of which 38 million had been incurred through december 31 2011 and 17 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050 in 2008 an artificial kelp reef project was completed the remaining costs are to complete a wetlands project and maintain both projects through 2050

 item 1a risk factors 

 

when evaluating our company and its subsidiaries you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report these risk factors could affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf other risks and uncertainties in addition to those that are described below may also materially impair our business operations if any of the following occurs our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed in addition the trading price of our securities could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning   our company set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

sempra energy’s cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries 

 

sempra energy’s ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own capital expenditures and longterm debt obligations in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including without limitation as a result of legislation regulation court order contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress 

 

our businesses may be materially adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 

 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and refund outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations 

 

the credit markets and financial services industry have experienced a period of extreme worldwide turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of many financial institutions and by extraordinary levels of government intervention and proposals for further intervention and additional regulation 

 

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial condition as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments in difficult credit markets we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support business activities this could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of funding both of which could significantly reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability 

 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings if the credit ratings of socalgas or sdge were to be reduced their businesses could be materially adversely affected and any reduction in sempra energy’s ratings could materially adversely affect sempra energy and its nonutility subsidiaries 

 

 

risks related to all sempra energy subsidiaries 

 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation 

 

in recent years the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on both federal and state levels these changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses moreover existing regulations laws and tariffs may be revised or reinterpreted and new regulations laws and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities special tariffs may also be imposed on components used in our businesses that could increase costs if applicable our businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements and the regulations laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs and new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations could materially affect our tax expense changes in regulations laws and tariffs and changes in the way regulations laws and tariffs are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the sempra utilities and other sempra energy operations these rules are commonly referred to as the affiliate transaction rules these businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas or to trade with the sempra utilities and with each other affiliate transaction rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the sempra utilities any such restrictions or approval requirements could materially adversely affect the lng terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or other operations of our subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

our businesses require numerous permits and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to materially increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

all of our existing and planned development projects require multiple approvals the acquisition ownership and operation of lng terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and electric generation and transmission facilities require numerous permits licenses certificates and other approvals from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies once received approvals may be subject to litigation and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed in litigation in addition permits licenses certificates and other approvals may be modified or rescinded by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities or we may be forced to incur additional costs any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain the necessary permits licenses certificates and other approvals could cause our sales to materially decline andor our costs to increase and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses 

 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

we   are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection including in particular climate change and ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees in addition we are generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our electric generation facilities and other energy projects regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws we may be subject to substantial penalties and fines andor significant curtailments of our operations which could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

the scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations including their effects on our current operations and future expansions are difficult to predict increasing international national regional and statelevel concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansion in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions including carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations the implementation of recent and proposed california and federal legislation and regulation may materially adversely affect our unregulated businesses by imposing among other things additional costs associated with emission limits controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits similarly the sempra utilities may be materially adversely affected if costs are not recoverable in rates the effects of existing and proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth sdge may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

 

in addition existing and future laws and regulation on mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates or other emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees and taxes that could materially adversely affect our businesses and profitability moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our facilities operations and profitability 

 

we provide further discussion of these matters in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism such facilities include 

 

 

such incidents could result in severe business disruptions significant decreases in revenues andor significant additional costs to us any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities affected any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires leaks radioactive releases explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties or cause personal injuries or fatalities any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become unavailable for certain of these risks and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against us 

 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings in particular sdge is subject to numerous lawsuits arising out of san diego county wildfires in 2007 we discuss this and other litigation in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report the uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition california juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part from our customers which in each case could materially adversely affect our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

 

we discuss these proceedings in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

new business technologies present a risk for attacks on our information systems and the integrity of our energy grid 

 

cybersecurity and the protection of our operations and activities are a priority at sempra energy sdge and socalgas the most significant cybersecurity risks to our businesses reside within the operations of our utilities in addition to general information and cyber risks that all fortune 500 corporations face eg malware malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces new cybersecurity risks associated with automated metering virtually all of our sdge customers have such metering and with smart grid infrastructure deployment of these new business technologies represents a new and largescale opportunity for attacks on the utilities’ information systems and more importantly on the integrity of the energy grid while addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across sempra energy’s businesses we cannot ensure that a successful attack will not occur such an attack to our information systems the integrity of the energy grid or one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

risks related to the sempra utilities 

 

the sempra utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may materially adversely affect the operations performance and growth of their businesses 

 

the cpuc regulates the sempra utilities’ rates except sdge’s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates the sempra utilities’ 

 

 

the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect results of operations and cash flows socalgas and sdge may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines under new regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations financial condition and cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the sempra utilities’ rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the annual report 

 

the sempra utilities may spend significant amounts of money related to a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if the project does not receive regulatory approval if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes or if management decides not to proceed with the project they may be unable to recover all amounts spent for that project which could materially adversely affect their businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the cpuc periodically approves the sempra utilities’ rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs and an authorized rate of return on investment if actual capital expenditures and operating costs were to exceed the amount approved by the cpuc results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected changes in interest rates may trigger mechanisms which determine the sempra utilities’ authorized rates of return changes in which could materially adversely affect results of operations and cash flows as we discuss under “cost of capital” in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

the cpuc applies performancebased measures and incentive mechanisms to all california utilities under these earnings potential above authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals rather than relying solely on expanding utility plant rate base to increase earnings at the sempra utilities the areas that are eligible for incentives are operational activities such as employee safety energy efficiency programs and at socalgas natural gas procurement and unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services although the sempra utilities have received incentive awards in the past there can be no assurance that they   will receive awards in the future or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods additionally if the sempra utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances penalties and fines which could have a material negative effect on their results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on transmission investments and other similar matters involving sdge 

 

the sempra utilities   may be materially adversely affected by new regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how they   operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses 

 

the construction and expansion of the sempra utilities’ natural gas pipelines socalgas’ storage facilities and sdge’s electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits licenses and other approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies if there are delays in obtaining these approvals or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the sempra utilities’ business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected coordinating these projects so that they are on time and within budget requires superior execution from our employees and contractors cooperation of third parties and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay in the event that one or more of these major projects is delayed or experiences significant cost overruns this could have a material adverse effect on the sempra utilities’ businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

recovery of 2007 wildfire litigation costs 

 

sdge is subject to numerous lawsuits arising out of the san diego county wildfires in 2007 it expects that substantially all reasonably incurred costs of resolving 2007 wildfire claims that exceed its liability insurance coverage and any amounts recovered from other potentially responsible parties will be recovered from utility customers at december 31 2011 sdge’s consolidated balance sheet includes a regulatory asset of 594 million associated with these costs however recovery from customers will require future regulatory actions and a failure to obtain all or a significant portion of the expected recovery or any negative assessment of the likelihood of recovery would likely have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s and sdge’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations in addition sdge’s cash flows may be materially adversely affected due to the timing differences between resolution of claims and the recoveries from other potentially responsible parties and utility customers which may extend over a number of years 

 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its ownership of nuclear facilities 

 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california operated by southern california edison company the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities sdge’s ownership interest in songs subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation which include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on sdge’s and sempra energy’s businesses cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

risks related to our generation lng pipelines  storage and other businesses 

 

our businesses are exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices and our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by these risks 

 

sempra generation generates electricity that it sells under longterm contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets it purchases natural gas to fuel its power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy its contractual obligations as part of its risk management strategy sempra generation may hedge a substantial portion of its electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage its portfolio which subjects us to the risk that the counterparty to such hedge may be unable to fulfill its obligations such a failure could materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for power plants or for lng terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas lng or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions 

 

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated commodities result from multiple factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

when our businesses enter into fixedprice longterm contracts to provide services or commodities we are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks 

 

sempra generation sempra pipelines  storage and sempra lng generally endeavor to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure however if these contracts are at fixed prices the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures including rising operational costs costs of labor materials equipment and commodities and rising interest rates that affect financing costs we may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects providing for cost escalation or entering into hedges however these measures if implemented may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses andor financing costs the failure to so fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

 

the acquisition development construction and expansion of lng terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built 

 

success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be materially adversely affected by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to complete the development of a facility or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns we may not be able to recover all or any part of our investment in the project 

 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of generation or regasification and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification storage and transmission systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to operating facilities below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition 

 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries have become highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility the 10year power sales agreement between sempra generation and the dwr which comprised 6 percent of our revenues in 2011 8 percent in 2010 and 9 percent in 2009 expired september 30 2011 as a result we may be unable to sell the power that sempra generation’s facilities are capable of producing which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

sempra lng utilizes its terminals by entering into longterm capacity agreements under these agreements customers pay sempra lng capacity reservation and usage fees to receive store and regasify the customer’s lng sempra lng also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified at its terminals for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices however if sempra lng is unable to obtain sufficient longterm agreements or if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition reduced availability of lng to the united states and mexico due to inadequate supplies increased demand and higher prices in other countries abundant domestic supplies of natural gas andor delays in the development of liquefaction capability at our own receipt terminals or worldwide are likely to delay attainment of fullcapacity utilization at our facilities our potential lng suppliers also may be subject to international political and economic pressures and risks which may also affect the supply of lng 

 

sempra pipelines  storage’s natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include sempra lng facilities 

 

we provide information about these matters in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to so perform we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements should they fail to so perform we may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition many of our agreements are essential to the conduct and growth of our businesses the failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows and financial condition finally we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

 

sempra lng’s obligations and those of its suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for “force majeure” events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements 

 

 

we rely on transportation assets and services much of which we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sempra pipelines  storage also depends on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra lng also relies on specialized ships to transport lng to its facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities sempra generation relies on transmission lines to sell electricity to its customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities electricity and other services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative natural gas supplies at thencurrent spot market rates which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

 

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices our hedging procedures may not work as planned 

 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng electric generation capacity and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

 

although we have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by the companies or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would materially adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

 

we own or have interests in electricity generation and transmission natural gas distribution and transportation and lng terminal projects in mexico and electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in argentina chile and peru developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political legal and financial risks that vary by country including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could materially reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in significantly increased taxes in foreign countries and materially adversely affect our businesses cash flows and results of operations 

 

we discuss litigation related to sempra lng’s energía costa azul lng terminal in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

 

other risks 

 

sempra energy has substantial investments and other obligations in businesses that it does not control or manage 

 

sempra energy is a partner with rbs in rbs sempra commodities a commoditiesmarketing firm which divested substantially all of its businesses and assets in 2010 and early 2011 as we discuss above under “description of business – rbs sempra commodities llp” our remaining investment in the partnership is 126 million at december 31 2011 we expect the partnership to distribute substantially all of this amount to us in the first half of 2012 minor amounts may be retained by the partnership beyond 2012 to help offset unanticipated future general and administrative costs necessary to complete the dissolution of the partnership we have guaranteed various obligations of businesses previously owned and operated by rbs sempra commodities as we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report the failure to collect all or a substantial portion of our remaining investment in the partnership could have a corresponding effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

 

as described above sdge holds a 20percent ownership interest in songs which is operated by edison we also own a 25percent interest in rockies express pipeline llc rockies express a joint venture which completed construction in 2009 of a 1679mile natural gas pipeline at a cost of 68 billion our investment in rockies express is 800 million at december 31 2011 rockies express is controlled by kinder morgan energy partners which holds a 50percent interest sempra generation has investments in several joint ventures to develop and operate renewable generation facilities we also have smaller investments in other entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control totaling 713 million at december 31 2011 we continue to make such investments 

 

we have limited influence over these and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest in addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

government regulation 

the most significant government regulation affecting sempra energy is the regulation of the sempra utilities 

california utility regulation 

the sempra utilities are regulated in california by the california public utilities commission cpuc the california energy commission cec and the california air resources board carb 

the california public utilities commission 

§ consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for staggered sixyear terms only four positions are currently filled 

§ regulates sdge’s and socalgas’ rates and conditions of service sales of securities rates of return capital structure rates of depreciation and longterm resource procurement except as described below in united states utility regulation 

§ has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric transmission electric distribution and natural gas storage transmission and distribution facilities in california 

§ conducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines and conducts investigations into various matters such as deregulation competition and the environment to determine its future policies 

§ regulates the interactions and transactions of the sempra utilities with sempra energy and its other affiliates 

we provide further discussion in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

sdge is also subject to regulation by the cec which publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based upon these forecasts the cec 

§ determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs 

§ sponsors alternativeenergy research and development projects 

§ promotes energy conservation programs 

§ maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages and 

§ certifies powerplant sites and related facilities within california 

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the sempra utilities’ longterm investment decisions 

the state of california requires certain california electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver 20 percent of their retail demand from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the renewables portfolio standard rps program we discuss this requirement as it applies to sdge in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report certification of a generation project by the cec as an eligible renewable energy resource err allows the purchase of output from a generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements this may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by sempra generation particularly from california utilities final certification as an err for sempra generation’s el dorado solar generation facility was approved in june 2009 sempra generation has filed for err certification of its copper mountain solar facility in nevada 

california assembly bill 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 assigns responsibility to carb for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions the bill requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a department within the california environmental protection agency an organization which reports directly to the governors office in the executive branch of california state government in september 2010 carb adopted a requirement known as the california renewable energy standard res which obligates california utilities to procure 33 percent of their annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2020 carb has not yet issued the final version of formal regulations articulating the requirement or detailing how the res will be implemented 

united states utility regulation 

the sempra utilities are also regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 

in the case of sdge the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access rates of return on transmission investment the uniform systems of accounts rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale 

in the case of socalgas the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas and the uniform systems of accounts 

the nrc oversees the licensing construction and operation of nuclear facilities in the united states including the san onofre nuclear generating station songs in which sdge owns a 20percent interest nrc regulations require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities periodically the nrc requires that newly developed data and techniques be used to reanalyze the design of a nuclear power plant and as a result may require plant modifications as a condition of continued operation 

the department of transportation dot has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures applicable for the sempra utilities’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines the dot has certified the cpuc to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in california

we describe other regulatory matters in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

california natural gas utility operations 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for itself and sdge on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others the sempra utilities’ resource planning natural gas procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters are discussed below we also provide further discussion in the annual report in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

customers 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial and industrial customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the sempra utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements 

in 2010 socalgas added 24000 new natural gas customer meters at a growth rate of 04 percent in 2009 it added 27000 new meters at a growth rate of 05 percent sdge added 4300 and 4200 new natural gas customer meters in 2010 and 2009 respectively both at a growth rate of 05 percent based on forecasts of new housing starts socalgas and sdge each expects that its new meter growth rates in 2011 will be comparable to those in 2010 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

socalgas purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the sempra utilities’ core customers socalgas purchases natural gas from canada the us rockies and the southwestern us to meet customer requirements and maintain pipeline reliability it also purchases some california natural gas production and additional supplies delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements purchases of natural gas are primarily based on published monthly bidweek indices 

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has entered into firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights interstate pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california the ferc regulates the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services 

socalgas has natural gas transportation contracts with various interstate pipelines these contracts expire on various dates between 2011 and 2025 

natural gas storage 

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers the sempra utilities’ core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others through an open bid process the storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to purchase and store natural gas when natural gas costs are low usually during the summer thereby reducing purchases when natural gas costs are expected to be higher this program allows customers to better manage their natural gas procurement and transportation needs 

demand for natural gas 

growth in the demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products environmental regulations renewable energy legislation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs external factors such as weather the price of electricity electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in demand and market price 

the sempra utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on customers preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products in the noncore industrial market some customers are capable of securing alternate fuel supplies from other suppliers which can affect the demand for natural gas the sempra utilities’ ability to maintain their respective industrial market shares is largely dependent on the relative spread between delivered energy prices 

natural gas demand for electric generation within southern california competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the growth in renewable generation the addition of more efficient gas technologies and to the extent that regulatory changes and electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the sempra utilities’ respective service areas the demand may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources we provide additional information regarding electric industry restructuring in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and revenues generally are greater during the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry socalgas injects natural gas into storage during the summer months usually april through october for withdrawal from storage during the winter months usually november through march when customer demand is higher 

electric utility operations 

customers 

sdge’s service area covers 4100 square miles at december 31 2010 sdge had 14 million customer meters consisting of 

§ 1232000 residential 

§ 147000 commercial 

§ 500 industrial 

§ 2100 street and highway lighting 

§ 4500 direct access 

sdge added 7000 new electric customer meters at a growth rate of 05 percent in both 2010 and 2009 based on forecasts of new housing starts sdge expects that its new meter growth rate in 2011 will be comparable to that in 2010 

resource planning and power procurement 

sdges resource planning power procurement and related regulatory matters are discussed in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 14 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

electric resources 

the supply of electric power available to sdge for resale is based on cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts currently in place with its various suppliers its palomar and miramar generating facilities its 20percent ownership interest in songs and purchases on a spot basis this supply as of december 31 2010 is as follows 

 

  

under the contract with pge sdge pays a capacity charge plus a charge based on the amount of energy received andor pges nonfuel costs costs under most of the contracts with qfs are based on sdges avoided cost charges under the remaining contracts are for firm and asavailable energy and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity the prices under these contracts are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated 

natural gas supply 

sdge buys natural gas under shortterm contracts for its palomar and miramar generating facilities and for the cabrillo power i llc otay mesa energy center llc orange grove energy lp and el cajon energy llc tolling contracts purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily based on published monthly bidweek indices sdges natural gas is delivered from southern california border receipt points to the socal citygate pool via firm access rights which expire on september 30 2011 the natural gas is then delivered from the socal citygate pool to the generating facilities through socalgas pipelines in accordance with a transportation agreement that expires on may 31 2011 sdge has also contracted with socalgas for natural gas storage from april 1 2010 to march 31 2011 

sdge also buys natural gas as the california dwrs limited agent for the dwrallocated contracts most of the natural gas deliveries for the dwrallocated contracts are transported through the kern river gas transmission pipeline under a longterm transportation agreement the dwr is financially responsible for the costs of gas and transportation 

songs 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs which is located south of san clemente california songs consists of two operating nuclear generating units the city of riverside owns 179 percent and southern california edison edison the operator of songs owns the remaining interest 

the two units began commercial operation in august 1983 and april 1984 respectively sdges share of the capacity from the two units is 430 mw 

a third unit was removed from service in november 1992 decommissioning of that unit is largely complete with the remaining work to be done in the future when the remaining two units are decommissioned its spent nuclear fuel is being stored on site in an independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi licensed by the nrc 

sdge has fully recovered the capital invested through december 31 2003 in songs and earns a return only on subsequent capital additions including sdge’s share of costs associated with the steam generator replacement project which is currently in progress 

we provide additional information concerning the songs units and nuclear decommissioning below in environmental matters and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 6 14 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

nuclear fuel supply 

the nuclear fuel supply cycle includes materials and services performed by others under various contracts that extend through 2020 fuel supply contracts are indexpriced and provide nuclear fuel through 2022 the expiration of songs’ nrc license 

spent fuel from songs is being stored on site in both the isfsi and spent fuel pools with the completion of the current phase of decommissioning the site has adequate space to build isfsi storage capacity through 2022 pursuant to the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 sdge entered into a contract with the us department of energy doe for spentfuel disposal under the agreement the doe is responsible for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel from songs sdge pays the doe a disposal fee of 100 per megawatthour of net nuclear generation or 3 million per year it is uncertain when the doe will begin accepting spent fuel from any nuclear generation facility 

we provide additional information concerning nuclearfuel costs and the storage and movement of spent fuel in notes 14 and 16 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

power pools 

sdge is a participant in the western systems power pool which includes an electricpower and transmissionrate agreement with utilities and power agencies located throughout the united states and canada more than 300 investorowned and municipal utilities state and federal power agencies energy brokers and power marketers share power and information in order to increase efficiency and competition in the bulk power market participants are able to make power transactions on standardized terms including marketbased rates preapproved by the ferc 

transmission arrangements 

sdges 500kilovolt kv southwest powerlink transmission line which is shared with arizona public service company and imperial irrigation district extends from palo verde arizona to san diego california sdges share of the line is 1162 mw although it can be less under certain system conditions 

mexicos baja california system is connected to sdges system via two 230kv interconnections with firm capability of 408 mw in the north to south direction and 800 mw in the south to north direction 

sdge’s sunrise powerlink a new 117mile 500kv transmission line project that is designed to deliver up to 1000 megawatts of energy from the imperial valley to the san diego region received approval from the cpuc in december 2008 the bureau of land management in january 2009 and the us forest service in july 2010 sdge commenced construction in the fall of 2010 and expects the line to be in commercial operation in the second half of 2012 we provide further discussion in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

transmission access 

the national energy policy act governs procedures for requests for transmission service the ferc approved the california investorowned utilities ious transfer of operation and control of their transmission facilities to the independent system operator iso in 1998 we provide additional information regarding transmission issues in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

rates and regulation – sempra utilities 

we provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to the sempra utilities in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

sempra global 

sempra global is a holding company for most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to california utility regulation sempra global includes sempra generation sempra pipelines  storage sempra lng and sempra commodities we provide descriptions of these business units and information concerning their operations under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1 3 4 16 17 and 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

competition 

sempra energy’s nonutility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar products and services they are engaged in highly competitive activities that require significant capital investments and highly skilled and experienced personnel many of their competitors may have significantly greater financial personnel and other resources than sempra global 

sempra generation 

for sales of noncontracted power sempra generation is subject to competition from energy marketers utilities industrial companies and other independent power producers for a number of years natural gas has been the fuel of choice for new power generation facilities for economic operational and environmental reasons while natural gasfired facilities will continue to be an important part of the nation’s generation portfolio some regulated utilities are now constructing units powered by renewable resources often with subsidies or under legislative mandate these utilities generally have a lower cost of capital than most independent power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms this recovery allows them to build buy and upgrade generation without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments 

when sempra generation sells power not subject to longterm contract commitments it is exposed to market fluctuations in prices based on a number of factors including the amount of capacity available to meet demand the price and availability of fuel and the presence of transmission constraints additionally generation from sempra generation’s renewable energy assets is exposed to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind weather and hours of sunlight some of sempra generation’s competitors such as electric utilities and generation companies have their own generation capacity including natural gas coal and nuclear generation these companies generally larger than sempra generation may have a lower cost of capital and may have competitive advantages as a result of their scale and the location of their generation facilities 

sempra generation’s competitors include 

   

sempra pipelines  storage 

within its market area sempra pipelines  storage’s natural gas storage facilities and pipelines compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines it competes primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and connections to downstream markets 

sempra pipelines  storage’s competitors include 

   

sempra lng 

new supplies to meet north america’s natural gas demand may be developed from a combination of the following sources 

§ existing producing basins in the united states canada and mexico 

§ frontier basins in alaska canada and offshore north america 

§ areas currently restricted from exploration and development due to public policies such as areas in the rocky mountains and offshore atlantic pacific and gulf of mexico coasts 

§ previously inaccessible or uneconomic natural gas reserves through hydraulic fracturing natural gas recovery from deep shale formations and other new exploration drilling and production techniques and 

§ lng imported into lng receipt terminals in operation or under development in the united states canada and mexico 

in addition the demand for energy currently met by natural gas could be met by other energy forms such as coal hydroelectric oil wind solar geothermal biomass and nuclear energy sempra lng will therefore face competition from companies who supply each of these energy sources 

sempra lng competes with other companies that operate lng receiving terminals and purchase lng as of december 31 2010 there were 16 existing and operating lng receipt terminals in north america there are two additional lng receipt terminals currently under construction in north america worldwide there are 82 existing and operating lng receipt terminals in 21 countries there are also other proposed lng receipt terminals worldwide with which sempra lng will compete to be the most economical delivery point for lng supply of both longterm contracted and spot volumes 

sempra lng’s major domestic and international competitors include the following companies and their related lng affiliates 

   

sempra commodities 

sempra commodities consists of our investment in rbs sempra commodities a joint venture formed in april 2008 as we discuss above under “description of business – sempra commodities” substantially all of the joint venture’s businesses and assets were divested in 2010 and early 2011 

environmental matters 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in notes 14 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions 

hazardous substances 

in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allowing californias ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the sempra utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the sempra utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates 

at december 31 2010 we had accrued estimated remaining investigation and remediation liabilities of 06 million at sdge and 202 million at socalgas both related to hazardous waste sites for which the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism authorizes us to recover 90 percent of the costs the accruals include costs for numerous locations most of which had been manufacturedgas plants this estimated cost excludes remediation costs of 54 million associated with sdges former fossilfuel power plants and other locations for which the cleanup costs are not being recovered in rates we believe that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of sempra energy sdge or pesocalgas 

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets 

air and water quality 

the electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent airquality and greenhouse gas standards such as those established by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the carb we discuss these standards in government regulation – california utility regulation above the sempra utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards 

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other owners of songs have an agreement with the california coastal commission to mitigate environmental impacts to the marine environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs sdges share of the mitigation costs is estimated to be 53 million of which 36 million had been incurred through december 31 2010 and 17 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050 in 2008 an artificial kelp reef project was completed the remaining costs are to complete a wetlands project and maintain both projects through 2050

 item 1a risk factors 

when evaluating our company and its subsidiaries you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report these risk factors could affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf other risks and uncertainties in addition to those that are described below may also impair our business operations if any of the following occurs our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed in addition the trading price of our securities could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning our company set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report 

sempra energys cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries 

sempra energys ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own capital expenditures and longterm debt obligations in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including as a result of legislation or regulation or in times of financial distress 

our businesses may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and refund outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations 

the credit markets and financial services industry have recently experienced a period of extreme worldwide turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of many financial institutions and by extraordinary levels of government intervention and proposals for further intervention and additional regulation 

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult credit markets we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support business activities this could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of funding both of which could reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings if the credit ratings of socalgas or sdge were to be reduced their businesses could be adversely affected and any reduction in sempra energys ratings could adversely affect its nonutility subsidiaries 

risks related to all sempra energy subsidiaries 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation 

in recent years the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on both federal and state levels these changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses moreover existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities our business is subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements and the laws and regulations that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs and new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations could materially affect our tax expense changes in laws and regulations may have a detrimental effect on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the sempra utilities and other sempra energy operations these rules are commonly referred to as the affiliate transaction rules these businesses could be adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas or to trade with the sempra utilities and with each other affiliate transaction rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the sempra utilities any such restrictions or approval requirements could adversely affect the lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or other operations of our subsidiaries 

our businesses require numerous permits and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals could cause our sales to decline andor our costs to increase 

all of our existing and planned development projects require multiple permits the acquisition ownership and operation of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and electric generation and transmission facilities require numerous permits approvals and certificates from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies once received approvals may be subject to litigation and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed in litigation if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities or we may be forced to incur additional costs 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection including in particular climate change and ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees in addition we are generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our electric generation facilities and other energy projects regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws we may be subject to penalties fines andor curtailments of our operations 

the scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations including their effects on our current operations and future expansions are difficult to predict increasing international national regional and statelevel concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansion in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions including carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride may limit or otherwise adversely affect our operations the implementation of recent and proposed california and federal legislation and regulation may adversely affect our unregulated businesses by imposing additional costs associated with emission limits controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits similarly the sempra utilities may be affected if costs are not recoverable in rates the effects of existing and proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth in addition sdge may be subject to penalties if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

in addition existing and future laws and regulation on mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates or other emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees and taxes that could adversely affect us moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may adversely affect us and our facilities and operations 

we provide further discussion of these matters in notes 14 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our business earnings and cash flows 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism such facilities include 

 such incidents could result in severe business disruptions significant decreases in revenues andor significant additional costs to us any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition earnings and cash flows 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities affected any such incident also could cause fires leaks explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties or cause personal injuries or fatalities any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become unavailable for certain of these risks and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities which could materially adversely affect our financial condition earnings and cash flows 

our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against us 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts defending these lawsuits and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings in particular sdge is subject to numerous lawsuits arising out of san diego county wildfires in 2007 we discuss this and other litigation in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report the uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition california juries have demonstrated an increasing willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and could materially adversely affect our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we discuss these proceedings in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report 

risks related to the sempra utilities 

the sempra utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may adversely affect the operations performance and growth of their businesses 

the cpuc regulates the sempra utilities rates except sdges electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates the sempra utilities 

 the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances and penalties that could adversely affect earnings and cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the sempra utilities rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report 

the sempra utilities may spend funds related to a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if the project does not receive regulatory approval or if management decides not to proceed with the project they may not be able to recover all amounts spent for that project which could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 

the cpuc periodically approves the sempra utilities rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs and an authorized rate of return on investment if actual capital expenditures and operating costs were to exceed the amount approved by the cpuc earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the cpuc applies performancebased measures and incentive mechanisms to all california utilities under these earnings potential above authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals rather than relying solely on expanding utility plant rate base to increase earnings at the sempra utilities the areas that are eligible for incentives are operational activities such as employee safety energy efficiency programs and at socalgas natural gas procurement and unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services although the sempra utilities have received incentive awards in the past there can be no assurance that they will receive awards in the future or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods additionally if the sempra utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances or penalties which could negatively affect earnings and cash flows 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on transmission investments and other similar matters involving sdge 

the sempra utilities may be adversely affected by new regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how they operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur additional expenses 

the construction and expansion of the sempra utilities natural gas pipelines socalgas storage facilities and sdges electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits and approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies if there are delays in obtaining required approvals or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the sempra utilities business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

recovery of 2007 wildfire litigation costs 

sdge is subject to numerous lawsuits arising out of the san diego county wildfires in 2007 it expects that substantially all reasonably incurred costs of resolving 2007 wildfire claims that exceed its liability insurance coverage and any amounts recovered from other potentially responsible parties will be recovered from utility customers however recovery from customers will require future regulatory actions and a failure to obtain recovery or any negative assessment of the likelihood of recovery would likely have a material adverse effect on sempra energy’s and sdge’s cash flows and results of operations in addition sdges cash flows may be adversely affected due to the timing differences between resolution of claims and the recoveries from other potentially responsible parties and utility customers which may extend over a number of years 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its ownership of nuclear facilities 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california operated by southern california edison company the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities sdges ownership interest in songs subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation which include 

§ the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials 

§ limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations and 

§ uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of replacing steam generators or other equipment and the decommissioning of nuclear plants 

risks related to our generation lng pipelines  storage and other businesses 

our businesses are exposed to market risk and our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity market prices that are beyond our control 

sempra generation generates electricity that it sells under longterm contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets it purchases natural gas to fuel its power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy its contractual obligations as part of its risk management strategy sempra generation may hedge a substantial portion of its electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage its portfolio 

we buy energyrelated commodities from time to time for power plants or for lng receipt terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas lng or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions 

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated commodities result from multiple factors including 

§ weather conditions 

§ seasonality 

§ changes in supply and demand 

§ transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies 

§ availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources 

§ commodity production levels 

§ actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries with respect to the supply of crude oil 

§ federal state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation 

§ natural disasters wars embargoes and other catastrophic events 

§ expropriation of assets by foreign countries 

the ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and as a result may have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

when our businesses enter into fixedprice longterm contracts to provide services or commodities we are exposed to inflation and interest rate risks 

sempra generation sempra pipelines  storage and sempra lng generally endeavor to secure longterm contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure however if these contracts are at fixed prices the profitability of the contract may be adversely affected by inflationary pressures including rising operational costs costs of labor materials and equipment and rising interest rates that affect financing costs to the extent possible we may mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects or providing for cost escalation however these measures may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses andor financing costs 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

the acquisition development construction and expansion of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built 

success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

§ negotiation of satisfactory engineering procurement and construction agreements 

§ negotiation of supply and natural gas sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements 

§ receipt of required governmental permits 

§ timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by 

§ unforeseen engineering problems 

§ construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls 

§ work stoppages 

§ equipment supply 

§ adverse weather conditions 

§ environmental and geological conditions 

§ other factors 

if we are unable to complete the development of a facility we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of generation or regasification and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification storage and transmission systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to operating facilities below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could adversely affect our business cash flows and results of operations 

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries have become highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility the 10year power sales agreement between sempra generation and the dwr which comprised 8 percent of our revenues in 2010 9 percent in 2009 and 10 percent in 2008 expires in september 2011 as a result we may be unable to sell the power generated by sempra generations facilities or operate those facilities profitably 

sempra lng utilizes its receipt terminals by entering into longterm capacity agreements under these agreements customers pay sempra lng capacity reservation and usage fees to receive store and regasify the customers lng sempra lng also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified at its terminals for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices however if sempra lng is unable to obtain sufficient longterm agreements or if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition reduced availability of lng to the united states and mexico due to inadequate supplies increased demand and higher prices in other countries abundant domestic supplies of natural gas andor delays in the development of new liquefaction capacity could affect the timing of expansion of our existing lng facilities these conditions also are likely to delay attainment of fullcapacity utilization at our facilities our potential lng suppliers also may be subject to international political and economic pressures and risks which may also affect the supply of lng 

sempra pipelines  storages natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on supplies of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include sempra lng facilities 

we provide information about these matters in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to perform we could incur substantial expenses and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could adversely affect our liquidity cash flows and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements will not perform their obligations under such agreements should they fail to perform we may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

sempra lngs obligations and those of its suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for force majeure events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements 

we rely on transportation assets and services that we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to 

§ deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets 

§ supply natural gas to our electric generation facilities and 

§ provide retail energy services to customers 

sempra pipelines  storage also depends on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra lng also relies on specialized ships to transport lng to its facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate our ability to sell and deliver our products and services may be hindered as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative natural gas supplies at thencurrent spot market rates 

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices our hedging procedures may not work as planned 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng electric generation capacity and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

although we have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by the companies or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would negatively affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

we have interests in electricity generation and transmission natural gas distribution and transportation and lng terminal projects in mexico and electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in argentina chile and peru and we intend to significantly increase our interests in south america as we discuss in note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political legal and financial risks that vary by country including 

§ changes in foreign laws and regulations including tax and environmental laws and regulations and us laws and regulations related to foreign operations 

§ high rates of inflation 

§ changes in government policies or personnel 

§ trade restrictions 

§ limitations on us company ownership in foreign countries 

§ permitting and regulatory compliance 

§ changes in labor supply and labor relations 

§ adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals challenges to permits difficulty in enforcing contractual rights and unsettled property rights and titles in mexico and other foreign jurisdictions 

§ general political economic and business conditions 

our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in increased taxes in foreign countries while sempra pipelines  storage believes that it has contracts and other measures in place to mitigate its most significant foreign currency exchange risks some exposure is not fully mitigated 

we discuss litigation related to sempra lngs energía costa azul lng receipt terminal in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

other risks 

sempra energy has substantial investments and other obligations in businesses that it does not control or manage 

sempra energy is a partner with rbs in rbs sempra commodities a commoditiesmarketing firm which divested substantially all of its businesses and assets in 2010 and early 2011 as we discuss above under description of business – sempra commodities our remaining investment in the partnership is 787 million at december 31 2010 the realization of this investment which is the undistributed portion of our share of the proceeds from the divestitures and related cash distributions depends on the collection of accounts receivable by the partnership as well as net margin that is expected to be collected as customers are transferred to the new owner of certain businesses sold we have guaranteed various obligations of businesses previously owned and operated by rbs sempra commodities as we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

we also own a 25percent interest in rockies express pipeline llc rockies express a joint venture which completed construction in 2009 of a 1679mile natural gas pipeline at an estimated cost of approximately 68 billion our investment in rockies express is 854 million at december 31 2010 rockies express is controlled by kinder morgan energy partners which holds a 50percent interest we also have smaller investments in other entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control and we continue to make such investments 

we may not control and have limited influence over these businesses and their management in addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

sempra commodities  pending transaction 

in april 2008 sempra energy formed a partnership with the royal bank of scotland plc rbs to purchase and operate our commoditiesmarketing businesses which generally comprised the sempra commodities segment in november 2009 rbs announced its intention to divest its interest in this joint venture rbs sempra commodities llp rbs sempra commodities following a directive from the european commission to dispose of certain assets on february 16 2010 sempra energy rbs and the partnership entered into an agreement with jp morgan ventures energy corporation jp morgan ventures whereby jp morgan ventures will purchase the following businesses from the joint venture

§

the global oil metals coal emissions other than emissions related to the joint venture’s north american power business plastics agricultural commodities and concentrates commodities trading and marketing business

§

the european power and gas business

§

the investor products business 

rbs sempra commodities will retain its north american power and natural gas trading businesses and its retail energy solutions business these businesses have historically generated 40 to 60 percent of total earnings of the businesses in the partnership and have averaged more than 50 percent

subject to obtaining various regulatory approvals and other conditions the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2010 jp morgan ventures will pay an aggregate purchase price equal to the estimated book value at closing of the businesses purchased generally computed on the basis of international financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union plus an amount equal to 468 million sempra energy will be entitled to 53 13 percent of the aggregate purchase price and rbs will be entitled to 4623 percent of the aggregate purchase price

in connection with the transaction we and rbs entered into a letter agreement to negotiate prior to closing of the transaction definitive documentation to amend certain provisions of the limited liability partnership agreement dated april 1 2008 between sempra energy and rbs as rbs continues to be obligated to divest its remaining interest in the partnership the letter agreement also provides for negotiating the framework for the entertaining bids for the remaining part of the partnership’s business

government regulation 

the most significant government regulation affecting sempra energy is the regulation of our utility subsidiaries

california utility regulation 

the sempra utilities are regulated in california by the california public utilities commission cpuc the california energy commission cec and the california air resources board carb

the california public utilities commission

§

consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for staggered sixyear terms

§

regulates sdge’s and socalgas’ rates and conditions of service sales of securities rates of return capital structure rates of depreciation and longterm resource procurement except as described below in united states utility regulation

§

has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric transmission electric distribution and natural gas storage transmission and distribution facilities in california

§

conducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines and conducts investigations into various matters such as deregulation competition and the environment to determine its future policies

§

regulates the interactions and transactions of the sempra utilities with sempra energy and its other affiliates

we provide further discussion in notes 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

sdge is also subject to regulation by the cec which publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based upon these forecasts the cec 

§

determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs

§

sponsors alternativeenergy research and development projects

§

promotes energy conservation programs

§

maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages and

§

certifies powerplant sites and related facilities within california 

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the sempra utilities’ longterm investment decisions

the state of california requires certain california electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver 20 percent of their 2010 retail demand from renewable energy sources the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the renewables portfolio standard rps program certification of a generation project by the cec as an eligible 

renewable energy resource err allows the purchase of output from a generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements this may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by sempra generation particularly from california utilities final certification as an err for sempra generation’s el dorado solar generation facility was approved in june 2009 

in september 2009 the governor of california issued an executive order which directs the california utilities to procure 33 percent of their electric energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020 this executive order designates the carb as the agency responsible for establishing the compliance rules and regulations for this program

california assembly bill 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 assigns responsibility to carb for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions the bill requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a department within the california environmental protection agency an organization which reports directly to the governors office in the executive branch of california state government as the carb formulates its plan provisions of the plan may apply to the sempra utilities

united states utility regulation 

the sempra utilities are also regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the nuclear regulatory commission nrc

in the case of sdge the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access rates of return on transmission investment the uniform systems of accounts rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale 

in the case of socalgas the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas and the uniform systems of accounts

the nrc oversees the licensing construction and operation of nuclear facilities in the united states including the san onofre nuclear generating station songs in which sdge owns a 20percent interest nrc regulations require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities periodically the nrc requires that newly developed data and techniques be used to reanalyze the design of a nuclear power plant and as a result may require plant modifications as a condition of continued operation

we describe other regulatory matters in notes 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

california natural gas utility operations 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for itself and sdge on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others the sempra utilities’ resource planning natural gas procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters are discussed below we also provide further discussion in the annual report in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 16 and 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

customers 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial and industrial customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the sempra utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements 

in 2009 socalgas added 27000 new customer natural gas meters at a growth rate of 05 percent in 2008 it added 41000 new meters at a growth rate of 07 percent in 2009 sdge added 4200 new customer natural gas meters at a growth rate of 05 percent in 

2008 it added 3000 new meters at a growth rate of 04 percent we expect levels to remain low in 2010 and both socalgas and sdge expect new meter growth in 2010 to be comparable to that in 2009

natural gas procurement and transportation 

socalgas purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the sempra utilities’ core customers socalgas purchases natural gas from canada the us rockies and the southwestern us to meet customer requirements and maintain pipeline reliability it also purchases some california natural gas production and additional supplies delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements natural gas prices for substantially all contracts are based on published monthly bidweek indices

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas has entered into firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights interstate pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california the ferc regulates the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services 

socalgas has natural gas transportation contracts with various interstate pipelines these contracts expire on various dates between 2010 and 2025 

natural gas storage 

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers the sempra utilities’ core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others through an open bid process the storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to purchase and store natural gas when natural gas costs are low usually during the summer thereby reducing purchases when natural gas costs are expected to be higher this program allows customers to better manage their fuel procurement and transportation needs 

demand for natural gas 

growth in the demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternative energy products environmental regulations renewable energy legislation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs external factors such as weather the price of electricity electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in demand and market price 

the sempra utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on the customers preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products in the noncore industrial market some customers are capable of securing alternate fuel supplies from other suppliers which can affect the demand for natural gas the sempra utilities’ ability to maintain their respective industrial market shares is largely dependent on the relative spread between delivered energy prices 

natural gas demand for electric generation within southern california competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be significantly affected to the extent that regulatory changes and electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the sempra utilities’ respective service areas we provide additional information regarding electric industry restructuring in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

shortterm demand the demand for natural gas by electric generators is influenced by a number of factors including

§

the availability of alternative sources of generation for example the availability of hydroelectricity is highly dependent on precipitation in the western us and canada

§

the performance of other generation sources in the western us including nuclear and coal renewable energy and other natural gas facilities outside the service area and

§

the changes in enduse electricity demand for example natural gas use generally increases during extended heat waves 

longterm demand  the demand for natural gas used to generate electricity will be influenced by additional factors such as the location of new power plants and the development of renewable energy resources recently more generation capacity has been constructed outside the sempra utilities service area than within it this new generation will displace the output of older lessefficient local generation thereby reducing the use of natural gas for local electric generation over the next few years however the construction of smaller natural gasfired peaking and other electric generation facilities within the sempra utilities’ respective service areas are expected to result in a slight overall increase in the demand for local natural gas for electric generation

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and revenues generally are greater during the winter heating months as is prevalent in the industry socalgas injects natural gas into storage during the summer months usually april through october for withdrawal from storage during the winter months usually november through march when customer demand is higher

electric utility operations 

customers 

sdge’s service area covers 4100 square miles at december 31 2009 sdge had 14 million customer meters consisting of

in 2009 sdge added 7000 new electric customer meters at a growth rate of 05 percent in 2008 it added 7400 new customers at a growth rate of 05 percent based on forecasts of new housing starts sdge expects that its new meter growth rate in 2010 will be comparable to that in 2009 

resource planning and power procurement 

sdges resource planning power procurement and related regulatory matters are discussed in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 15 16 and 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

electric resources 

the supply of electric power available to sdge for resale is based on cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts currently in place with its various suppliers its palomar and miramar generating facilities its 20percent ownership interest in songs and purchases on a spot basis this supply as of december 31 2009 is as follows

 

under the contract with pge sdge pays a capacity charge plus a charge based on the amount of energy received andor pges nonfuel costs costs under most of the contracts with qfs are based on sdges avoided cost charges under the remaining contracts are for firm and asavailable energy and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity the prices under these contracts are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated

natural gas supply 

sdge buys natural gas under shortterm contracts for its palomar and miramar generating facilities and for the cabrillo power i llc and otay mesa energy center llc tolling contracts purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily based on published monthly bidweek indices sdges natural gas is delivered from southern california border receipt points to the socal citygate pool via firm access rights which expire on march 31 2011 the natural gas is then delivered from the socal citygate pool to the generating facilities through socalgas pipelines in accordance with a transportation agreement that expires on may 31 2011 sdge has also contracted with socalgas for natural gas storage from april 1 2009 to march 31 2010

sdge also buys natural gas as the california dwrs limited agent for the dwrallocated contracts most of the natural gas deliveries for the dwrallocated contracts are transported through the kern river gas transmission pipeline under a longterm transportation agreement the dwr is financially responsible for the costs of gas and transportation 

songs 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs which is located south of san clemente california songs consists of two operating nuclear generating units units 2 and 3 unit 1 is permanently shut down and is being decommissioned the city of riverside owns 179 percent of units 2 and 3 and southern california edison edison the operator of songs owns the remaining interest 

units 2 and 3 began commercial operation in august 1983 and april 1984 respectively sdges share of the capacity is 214 mw of unit 2 and 216 mw of unit 3

unit 1 was removed from service in november 1992 when the cpuc issued a decision to permanently shut it down the decommissioning of unit 1 is now in progress and its spent nuclear fuel is being stored on site in an independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi licensed by the nrc

sdge has fully recovered the capital invested through december 31 2003 in songs and earns a return only on subsequent capital additions including sdge’s share of costs associated with the steam generator replacement project which is currently in progress

we provide additional information concerning the songs units and nuclear decommissioning below in environmental matters and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 7 15 and 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

nuclear fuel supply 

the nuclear fuel supply cycle includes materials and services uranium oxide conversion of uranium oxide to uranium hexafluoride uranium enrichment services and fabrication of fuel assemblies performed by others under various contracts that extend through 2020 the supply contracts are indexpriced and provide nuclear fuel supply through 2022 the expiration of songs’ nrc license

spent fuel from songs is being stored on site in both the isfsi and spent fuel pools with the completion of the current phase of unit 1 decommissioning the site has adequate space to build isfsi storage capacity through 2022 pursuant to the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 sdge entered into a contract with the us department of energy doe for spentfuel disposal under the agreement the doe is responsible for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel from songs sdge pays the doe a disposal fee of 100 per megawatthour of net nuclear generation or 3 million per year it is uncertain when the doe will begin accepting spent fuel from any nuclear generation facility

we provide additional information concerning nuclearfuel costs and the storage and movement of spent fuel in notes 15 and 17 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

power pools 

sdge is a participant in the western systems power pool which includes an electricpower and transmissionrate agreement with utilities and power agencies located throughout the united states and canada more than 300 investorowned and municipal utilities state and federal power agencies energy brokers and power marketers share power and information in order to increase efficiency and competition in the bulk power market participants are able to make power transactions on standardized terms including marketbased rates preapproved by the ferc 

transmission arrangements 

sdges 500kv southwest powerlink transmission line which is shared with arizona public service company and imperial irrigation district extends from palo verde arizona to san diego california sdges share of the line is 1162 mw although it can be less under certain system conditions 

mexicos baja california system is connected to sdges system via two 230kv interconnections with firm capability of 408 mw in the north to south direction and 800 mw in the south to north direction 

in december 2008 the cpuc approved sdge’s sunrise powerlink a new 120mile 500kv transmission line between the imperial valley and the san diego region the project is in the preconstruction phase including final engineering design and procurement activities sdge expects the line to be in commercial operation in 2012 the sunrise powerlink is designed to have a path rating of 1000 mw we provide further discussion in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

we provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to the sempra utilities in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

sempra global 

sempra global is a holding company for most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to california utility regulation sempra global includes sempra commodities sempra generation sempra pipelines  storage and sempra lng we provide descriptions of these business units and information concerning their operations under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1 3 4 5 17 18 and 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

competition 

sempra energy’s nonutility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar products and services they are engaged in highly competitive activities that require significant capital investments and highly skilled and experienced personnel many of their competitors may have significantly greater financial personnel and other resources than sempra global 

sempra commodities 

sempra commodities is primarily comprised of our investment in rbs sempra commodities a joint venture formed in april 2008 this business unit also includes sempra rockies marketing which holds firm service capacity on the rockies express pipeline 

all aspects of rbs sempra commodities’ business are intensely competitive and are expected to remain so sources of competition include the following

§

other brokers and dealers

§

investment banking firms

§

energy companies and

§

other companies that offer similar products and services in the us and globally 

rbs sempra commodities’ competition is based on a number of factors including transaction execution financing products and services innovation reputation and price 

rbs sempra commodities also faces intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees rbs sempra commodities’ ability to compete effectively will depend upon the ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees 

rbs sempra commodities’ competitors include goldman sachs jpmorgan morgan stanley and barclay’s capital 

the partnership is discussed in notes 3 4 and 20 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements as we discuss above under “description of business” on february 16 2010 sempra energy rbs and the partnership entered into an agreement to sell certain businesses within the partnership

sempra generation 

for sales of noncontracted power sempra generation is subject to competition from energy marketers utilities industrial companies and other independent power producers for a number of years natural gas has been the fuel of choice for new power generation 

facilities for economic operational and environmental reasons while natural gasfired facilities will continue to be an important part of the nation’s generation portfolio some regulated utilities are now constructing units powered by renewable resources often with subsidies or under legislative mandate these utilities generally have a lower cost of capital than most independent power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms this recovery allows them to build buy and upgrade generation without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments 

when sempra generation sells power not subject to longterm contract commitments it is exposed to market fluctuations in prices based on a number of factors including the amount of capacity available to meet demand the price and availability of fuel and the presence of transmission constraints additionally generation from sempra generation’s renewable energy assets are exposed to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind weather and hours of sunlight some of sempra generation’s competitors such as electric utilities and generation companies have their own generation capacity including natural gas coal and nuclear generation these companies generally larger than sempra generation may have a lower cost of capital and may have competitive advantages as a result of their scale and the location of their generation facilities 

sempra generation’s competitors include

 sempra pipelines  storage 

within its market area sempra pipelines  storage’s natural gas storage facilities and pipelines compete with other storage facilities and pipelines both regulated and unregulated systems it competes primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and connections to downstream markets 

sempra pipelines  storage’s competitors include

 sempra lng 

new supplies to meet north america’s natural gas demand may be developed from a combination of the following sources

§

existing producing basins in the united states canada and mexico

§

frontier basins in alaska canada and offshore north america

§

areas currently restricted from exploration and development due to public policies such as areas in the rocky mountains and offshore atlantic pacific and gulf of mexico coasts

§

previously inaccessible or uneconomic natural gas reserves through the use of new extraction techniques and

§

lng imported into lng receipt terminals in operation or under development in the united states canada and mexico 

in addition the demand for energy currently met by natural gas could alternatively be met by other energy forms such as coal hydroelectric oil wind solar geothermal biomass and nuclear energy sempra lng will therefore face competition from each of these energy sources 

sempra lng competes with other companies to construct and operate lng receiving terminals and to purchase lng according to the ferc as of december 31 2009 there were 15 existing and operating lng receipt terminals in north america there are 3 lng receipt terminals currently under construction in addition as of december 31 2009 there were 63 lng receipt terminals in 18 countries there are also other proposed lng receipt terminals worldwide with which sempra lng will compete to be the most economical delivery point for lng supply of both longterm contracted and spot volumes 

sempra lng’s major domestic and international competitors include the following companies and their related lng affiliates

 environmental matters 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in notes 15 16 and 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions

hazardous substances 

in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allowing californias ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the sempra utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the sempra utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates

at december 31 2009 we had accrued estimated remaining investigation and remediation liabilities of 15 million at sdge and 279 million at socalgas both related to hazardous waste sites for which the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism authorizes us to recover 90 percent of the costs the accruals include costs for numerous locations most of which had been manufacturedgas plants this estimated cost excludes remediation costs of 59 million associated with sdges former fossilfuel power plants and other locations for which the cleanup costs are not being recovered in rates we believe that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets

air and water quality 

the transmission and distribution of natural gas require the operation of compressor stations which are subject to increasingly stringent airquality standards such as those established by the carb we discuss these standards in government regulation – california utility regulation above the sempra utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other owners of songs have an agreement with the california coastal commission to mitigate the environmental damage to the marine environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs sdges share of the mitigation costs is estimated to be 47 million of which 33 million had been incurred through december 31 2009 and 14 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050 in 2008 an artificial kelp reef project was completed the remaining costs are to complete a wetlands project and maintain both projects through 2050

 item 1a risk factors

when evaluating our company and its subsidiaries you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report these risk factors could affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf other risks and uncertainties in addition to those that are described below may also impair our business operations if any of the following occurs our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed in addition the trading price of our securities could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning our company set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report 

sempra energys cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries 

sempra energys ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own capital expenditures and longterm debt obligations in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including as a result of legislation or regulation or in times of financial distress 

our businesses may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and refund outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations

the credit markets and financial services industry have recently experienced a period of extreme worldwide turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of many financial institutions and by extraordinary levels of government intervention and proposals for further intervention and additional regulation

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult credit markets we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support business activities this could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of funding both of which could reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings if the credit ratings of socalgas or sdge were to be reduced their businesses could be adversely affected and any reduction in sempra energys ratings could adversely affect its nonutility subsidiaries

risks related to all sempra energy subsidiaries 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation 

in recent years the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on both federal and state levels these changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses moreover existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities our business is subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements and the laws and regulations that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs and new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations could materially affect our tax expense future changes in laws and regulations may have a detrimental effect on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the sempra utilities and other sempra energy operations these rules are commonly referred to as the affiliate transaction rules these businesses could be adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas or to trade with the sempra utilities and with each other affiliate transaction rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the sempra utilities any such restrictions or approval requirements could adversely affect the lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or trading operations of our subsidiaries

sempra generation has various proceedings inquiries and investigations relating to its business activities currently pending before the ferc a description of such proceedings inquiries and investigations is provided in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

our businesses require numerous permits and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals could cause our sales to decline andor our costs to increase 

all of our existing and planned development projects require multiple permits the acquisition ownership and operation of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and electric generation facilities require numerous permits approvals and certificates from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies once received approvals may be subject to litigation and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed in litigation if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to operate our facilities or we may be forced to incur additional costs 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection including in particular climate change and ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees in addition we are generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our electric generation facilities and other energy projects regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws we may be subject to penalties fines andor curtailments of our operations 

the scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations including their effects on our current operations and future expansions are difficult to predict increasing international national regional and statelevel concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansion in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of ghg emissions including carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride may limit or otherwise adversely affect our operations the implementation of recent california legislation and proposed federal legislation and regulation may adversely affect our unregulated businesses by imposing additional costs associated with emission limits controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits similarly the sempra utilities may be affected if costs are not recoverable in rates the effects of existing and proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth in addition sdge may be subject to penalties if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met 

in addition existing and future laws and regulation on mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates or other emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees and taxes that could adversely affect us moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may adversely affect us and our facilities and operations 

we provide further discussion of these matters in notes 15 16 and 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our business earnings and cash flows 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism such facilities include

 such incidents could result in severe business disruptions significant decreases in revenues or significant additional costs to us any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition earnings and cash flows 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities affected any such incident also could cause fires leaks explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties or cause personal injuries any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us insurance coverage may become unavailable for certain of these risks and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities which could materially adversely affect our financial condition earnings and cash flows

our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against us 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts defending these lawsuits and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings in particular sdge is subject to numerous lawsuits arising out of san diego county wildfires in 2007 and sempra generation is subject to extensive litigation regarding a major longterm power agreement we discuss these and other litigation in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report the uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition california juries have demonstrated an increasing willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and could materially adversely affect our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we discuss these proceedings in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report 

risks related to the sempra utilities 

the sempra utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities which may adversely affect the operations performance and growth of their businesses 

the cpuc regulates the sempra utilities rates except sdges electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates the sempra utilities 

 the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances and penalties that could adversely affect earnings and cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the sempra utilities rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in notes 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report 

the sempra utilities may spend funds related to a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if the project does not receive regulatory approval or if management decides not to proceed with the project they may not be able to recover all amounts spent for that project which could adversely affect earnings and cash flows

the cpuc periodically approves the sempra utilities rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs and an authorized rate of return on investment if actual capital expenditures and operating costs were to exceed the amount approved by the cpuc earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected

the cpuc applies performancebased measures and incentive mechanisms to all california utilities under these earnings potential above authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals rather than relying solely on expanding utility plant to increase earnings at the sempra utilities the areas that are eligible for incentives are operational activities such as employee safety energy efficiency programs and at socalgas natural gas procurement and unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services although the sempra utilities have received incentive awards in the past there can be no assurance that they will receive awards in the future or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods additionally if the sempra utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances or penalties which could negatively affect earnings and cash flows 

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on transmission investments and other similar matters involving sdge 

the sempra utilities may be adversely affected by new regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how they operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur additional expenses

the construction and expansion of the sempra utilities natural gas pipelines socalgas storage facilities and sdges electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits and approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies if there are delays in obtaining required approvals or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with applicable laws 

or regulations the sempra utilities business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its ownership of nuclear facilities 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california operated by southern california edison company the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities sdges ownership interest in songs subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation which include

§

the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials

§

limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations and

§

uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of replacing steam generators or other equipment and the decommissioning of nuclear plants

risks related to our electric generation lng pipelines  storage commodities marketing and other businesses 

our businesses are exposed to market risk and our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity market prices that are beyond our control 

sempra generation generates electricity that it sells under longterm contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets it purchases natural gas to fuel its power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy its contractual obligations as part of its risk management strategy sempra generation may hedge a substantial portion of its electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage its portfolio 

we buy energyrelated and other commodities from time to time for power plants or for lng receipt terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas lng or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated and other commodities result from multiple factors including 

§

weather conditions 

§

seasonality 

§

changes in supply and demand 

§

transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies 

§

availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources 

§

commodity production levels 

§

actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries with respect to the supply of crude oil 

§

federal state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation 

§

natural disasters wars embargoes and other catastrophic events 

§

expropriation of assets by foreign countries 

the ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and as a result may have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

the acquisition development construction and expansion of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built 

success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

§

negotiation of satisfactory engineering procurement and construction agreements 

§

negotiation of supply and natural gas sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements 

§

receipt of required governmental permits 

§

timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by 

§

unforeseen engineering problems 

§

construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls 

§

work stoppages 

§

equipment supply 

§

adverse weather conditions 

§

environmental and geological conditions 

§

other factors 

if we are unable to complete the development of a facility we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of generation or regasification and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification storage and transmission systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to operating facilities below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could adversely affect our business cash flows and results of operations

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our sales to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries have become highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements such as the 10year power sales agreement between sempra generation and the dwr that expires in 2011 our sales may be subject to increased price volatility as a result we may be unable to sell the power generated by sempra generations facilities or operate those facilities profitably 

sempra lng utilizes its receipt terminals by entering into longterm capacity agreements under these agreements customers pay sempra lng capacity reservation fees to receive store and regasify the customers lng sempra lng also may enter into shortterm andor longterm supply agreements to purchase lng to be received stored and regasified at its terminals for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying lng supply prices to prevailing natural gas price market price indices however if sempra lng is unable to obtain sufficient longterm agreements or if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition reduced availability of lng to the united states and mexico due to inadequate supplies increased demand and higher prices in other countries abundant domestic supplies of natural gas and delays in the development of new liquefaction capacity could affect the timing of development of new lng facilities and expansion of our existing lng facilities these conditions also are likely to delay attainment of fullcapacity utilization at our facilities our potential lng suppliers also may be subject to international political and economic pressures and risks which may also affect the supply of lng 

sempra pipelines  storages natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on supplies of lng andor natural gas from their transportation customers which may include sempra lng facilities

we provide information about these matters in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to perform we could incur substantial expenses and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could adversely affect our liquidity cash flows and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements will not perform their obligations under such agreements should they fail to 

perform we may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

sempra lngs obligations and those of its suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for force majeure events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements

if californias dwr were to succeed in setting aside or were to fail to perform its obligations under its longterm power contract with sempra generation our business results of operations and cash flows will be materially adversely affected 

in 2001 sempra generation entered into a 10year power sales agreement with the dwr to supply up to 1900 mw to the state the power sales agreement with the dwr continues to be the subject of extensive litigation between the parties before the ferc in the courts and in arbitration proceedings if the dwr were to succeed in setting aside its obligations under the contract or if the dwr fails or is unable to meet its contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition these proceedings are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report as described in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we unilaterally reduced our price to the dwr in connection with an agreement to settle other litigation

we rely on transportation assets and services that we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to

1 deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets 

2 supply natural gas to our electric generation facilities and 

3 provide retail energy services to customers 

sempra pipelines  storage also depends on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra lng also relies on specialized ships to transport lng to its facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate our ability to sell and deliver our products and services may be hindered as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative natural gas supplies at thencurrent spot market rates

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices our hedging procedures may not work as planned 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and lng electric generation capacity and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity as part of this strategy we may use forward contracts physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

although we have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by the companies or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would negatively affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

we have interests in electricity generation and transmission natural gas distribution and transportation and lng terminal projects in mexico sempra pipelines  storage has ownership interests in electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in argentina chile and peru we have an ownership interest in rbs sempra commodities which has trading marketing and risk management operations 

in canada europe and asia developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political legal and financial risks that vary by country including

§

changes in foreign laws and regulations including tax and environmental laws and regulations and us laws and regulations related to foreign operations

§

high rates of inflation

§

changes in government policies or personnel

§

trade restrictions

§

limitations on us company ownership in foreign countries

§

permitting and regulatory compliance

§

changes in labor supply and labor relations

§

adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals challenges to permits difficulty in enforcing contractual rights and unsettled property rights and titles in mexico and other foreign jurisdictions

§

general political economic and business conditions 

our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in increased taxes in foreign countries while sempra pipelines  storage believes that it has contracts and other measures in place to mitigate its most significant foreign currency exchange risks some exposure is not fully mitigated

other risks 

sempra energy has substantial investments and other obligations in businesses that it does not control or manage 

sempra energy is a partner with rbs in rbs sempra commodities a commoditiesmarketing firm in which we invested 16 billion rbs which has been greatly affected by the worldwide turmoil in banking and is now indirectly controlled by the government of the united kingdom is obligated to provide all of the additional capital required for the operation and expansion of the commoditiesmarketing business as we discuss above under “description of business” on february 16 2010 sempra energy rbs and rbs sempra commodities entered into an agreement to sell certain businesses within the joint venture

we also own a 25percent interest in rockies express pipeline llc rockies express a joint venture which completed construction in 2009 of a 1679mile natural gas pipeline at an estimated cost of approximately 68 billion rockies express is controlled by kinder morgan energy partners which holds a 50percent interest

we have also guaranteed a portion of the debt and other obligations of rbs sempra commodities and debt of rockies express as we discuss in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report we also have smaller investments in other entities that we do not control or manage

we do not control and have limited influence over these businesses and their management in addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

government regulation 

the most significant government regulation affecting sempra energy is the regulation of our utility subsidiaries

california utility regulation 

the sempra utilities are regulated in california by the california public utilities commission cpuc the california energy commission cec and the california air resources board carb

the california public utilities commission

§

consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for staggered sixyear terms

sdge is also subject to regulation by the cec which establishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based upon these forecasts the cec 

§

determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs

§

sponsors alternativeenergy research and development projects

§

promotes energy conservation programs

§

maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages and

§

certifies powerplant sites and related facilities within california 

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is one of many source materials used to support the sempra utilities’ longterm investment decisions

currently the state of california is requiring certain california electric retail sellers including sdge to deliver 20 percent of their 2010 retail demand from renewable energy sources and 33 percent by 2020 the rules governing this requirement administered by both the cpuc and the cec are generally known as the renewables portfolio standard rps program certification of a generation project by the cec as an eligible renewable energy resource err allows the purchase of output from a generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the rps program requirements this may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by sempra generation particularly from california utilities final certification as an err for sempra generation’s recently completed el dorado solar generation facility is pending

california assembly bill 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 makes the carb responsible for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions the bill requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission 

reductions including a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a part of the california environmental protection agency an organization which reports directly to the governors office in the executive branch of california state government as the carb formulates its plan provisions of the plan may apply to the sempra utilities

united states utility regulation 

the sempra utilities are also regulated nationally by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the nuclear regulatory commission nrc

in the case of sdge the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access rates of return on transmission investment the uniform systems of accounts rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale 

in the case of socalgas the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas and the uniform systems of accounts

the nrc oversees the licensing construction and operation of nuclear facilities in the united states including the nuclear power plant in which sdge owns an interest nrc regulations require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities periodically the nrc requires that newly developed data and techniques be used to reanalyze the design of a nuclear power plant and as a result may require plant modifications as a condition of continued operation

sempra pipelines  storage operates mobile gas service corporation mobile gas a small natural gas distribution utility serving southwest alabama that is regulated by the alabama public service commission apsc the ferc regulates mobile gas’ interstate transportation of natural gas the uniform systems of accounts and rates of depreciation

licenses and permits 

the sempra utilities obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the operation and construction of assets for the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity because these permits authorizations and licenses require periodic renewal they are continuously regulated by the granting agencies 

our other subsidiaries are also required to obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in the normal course of business some of these permits authorizations and licenses require periodic renewal 

sempra generation and its subsidiaries obtain a number of permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities and in connection with the wholesale distribution of electricity 

sempra pipelines  storage’s mexican subsidiaries obtain construction permits for their natural gas distribution and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided sempra pipelines  storage’s us operations obtain licenses and permits for natural gas storage facilities and pipelines 

sempra lng obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of lng facilities

we describe other regulatory matters in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

california natural gas utility operations 

socalgas and sdge sell distribute and transport natural gas socalgas purchases and stores natural gas for itself and sdge on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others the sempra utilities’ resource planning natural gas procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters are discussed below we also provide further discussion in the annual report in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

customers 

for regulatory purposes enduse customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers noncore customers at socalgas consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers noncore customers at sdge consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial and industrial customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from socalgas or sdge while core customers are permitted to aggregate their natural gas requirements and purchase directly from producers marketers or brokers the sempra utilities continue to be obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements 

natural gas procurement and transportation 

socalgas purchases natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts for the sempra utilities’ core customers socalgas purchases natural gas on a spot basis from canada the us rockies and the southwestern us to meet customer requirements and maintain pipeline reliability it also purchases some california natural gas production and additional spotmarket supplies delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to the distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas is committed to firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation entitlements interstate pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company and kern river gas transmission company provide transportation services into socalgas intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california the ferc regulates the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services 

socalgas has natural gas transportation contracts with various interstate pipelines these contracts expire on various dates between 2009 and 2025 

natural gas storage 

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for core noncore and nonenduse customers the sempra utilities’ core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas storage capacity socalgas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others through an open bid process the storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to purchase and store natural gas when natural gas costs are low usually during the summer thereby reducing purchases when natural gas costs are expected to be higher this program allows customers to better manage their fuel procurement and transportation needs 

demand for natural gas 

the sempra utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on the customers preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products in the noncore industrial market some customers are capable of securing alternate fuel supplies from other suppliers which can affect the demand for natural gas the sempra utilities’ ability to maintain their respective industrial market shares is largely dependent on the relative spread between delivered energy prices 

shortterm demand the demand for natural gas by electric generators is influenced by a number of factors

§

the availability of alternative sources of generation for example the availability of hydroelectricity is highly dependent on precipitation in the western us and canada

§

the performance of other generation sources in the western us including nuclear and coal renewable energy and other natural gas facilities outside the service area and

§

the changes in enduse electricity demand for example natural gas use generally increases during extended heat waves 

longterm demand  the demand for natural gas used to generate electricity will be influenced by additional factors such as the location of new power plants and the development of renewable energy resources recently more generation capacity has been constructed outside the sempra utilities service area than within it this new generation will displace the output of older lessefficient local generation thereby reducing the use of natural gas for local electric generation over the next few years however the construction of smaller natural gasfired peaking and other electric generation facilities within the sempra utilities’ respective service areas are expected to result in a slight overall increase in the demand for local natural gas for electric generation

natural gas demand for electric generation within southern california competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be significantly affected to the extent that regulatory changes and electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the sempra utilities’ respective service areas we provide additional information regarding electric industry restructuring in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

growth in the demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the southern california economy prices of alternate energy products environmental regulations renewable energy legislation and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs external factors such as weather the price of electricity electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in demand and market price 

in 2008 sdge added 3000 new customer natural gas meters at a growth rate of 04 percent in 2007 it added 5000 new meters at a growth rate of 07 percent in 2008 socalgas added 41000 new customer natural gas meters at a growth rate of 07 percent in 2007 it added 57000 new meters at a growth rate of 10 percent sdge and socalgas expect that their respective growth rates will continue to decline in 2009 based on housing market forecasts and due to the continuing economic downturn

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal and revenues generally are greater during the winter months as is prevalent in the industry socalgas injects natural gas into storage during the summer months usually april through october for withdrawal from storage during the winter months usually november through march when customer demand is higher

electric utility operations 

customers 

sdge’s service area covers 4100 square miles at december 31 2008 sdge had 14 million customer meters consisting of 

§

1217200 residential

§

147600 commercial

§

500 industrial

§

2000 street and highway lighting

§

5000 direct access

in 2008 sdge added 7400 new electric customer meters at a growth rate of 05 percent in 2007 it added 10000 new customers at a growth rate of 07 percent sdge expects that its growth rate will continue to decline in 2009 based on housing market forecasts and due to the continuing economic downturn 

resource planning and power procurement 

sdges resource planning power procurement and related regulatory matters are discussed in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 14 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

electric resources 

the supply of electric power available to sdge for resale is based on cpucapproved purchasedpower contracts currently in place with its various suppliers its palomar and miramar generating facilities its 20percent ownership interest in the san onofre nuclear generating station songs and purchases on a spot basis this supply as of december 31 2008 is as follows 

 

under the contract with pge sdge pays a capacity charge plus a charge based on the amount of energy received andor pges nonfuel costs costs under most of the contracts with qfs are based on sdges avoided cost charges under the remaining contracts are for firm and asavailable energy and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity the prices under these contracts are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated

natural gas supply 

sdge buys natural gas under shortterm contracts for its palomar and miramar generating facilities and for the cabrillo power i llc and dynegy south bay holdings llc tolling contracts purchases are from various southwestern us suppliers and are primarily based on monthly and spotmarket prices sdges natural gas is 

delivered from southern california border receipt points to the socal citygate pool via firm access rights which expire on march 31 2011 the natural gas is then delivered from the socal citygate pool to the generating facilities through socalgas pipelines on a socalgas transportation agreement that expires on may 31 2009 prior to the expiration of this agreement sdge intends to enter into a new transportation agreement with socalgas to meet its projected delivery requirements sdge has also contracted with socalgas for natural gas storage from april 1 2009 to march 31 2010

sdge also buys natural gas as the california dwrs limited agent for the dwrallocated contracts most of the natural gas deliveries for the dwrallocated contracts are transported through the kern river gas transmission pipeline under a longterm transportation agreement the dwr is financially responsible for the costs of gas and transportation 

songs 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs which is located south of san clemente california songs consists of two operating nuclear generating units units 2 and 3 unit 1 is permanently shut down and is being decommissioned the city of riverside owns 179 percent of units 2 and 3 and southern california edison edison the operator of songs owns the remaining interests 

units 2 and 3 began commercial operation in august 1983 and april 1984 respectively sdges share of the capacity is 214 mw of unit 2 and 216 mw of unit 3

unit 1 was removed from service in november 1992 when the cpuc issued a decision to permanently shut it down the decommissioning of unit 1 is now in progress and its spent nuclear fuel is being stored on site in an independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi licensed by the nrc

sdge has fully recovered its capital investment in songs through december 31 2003 and earns a return only on subsequent capital additions including sdge’s share of costs associated with planned steam generator replacements

we provide additional information concerning the songs units and nuclear decommissioning below in environmental matters and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 7 14 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

nuclear fuel supply 

the nuclear fuel supply cycle includes materials and services uranium oxide conversion of uranium oxide to uranium hexafluoride uranium enrichment services and fabrication of fuel assemblies performed by others under various contracts that extend through 2020 the supply contracts are indexpriced and provide nuclear fuel supply through 2022 the expiration of songs’ nrc license

spent fuel from songs is being stored on site in both the isfsi and spent fuel pools upon completion of the current phase of unit 1 decommissioning the site will have adequate space to build isfsi storage capacity through 2022 pursuant to the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 sdge entered into a contract with the us department of energy doe for spentfuel disposal under the agreement the doe is responsible for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel from songs sdge pays the doe a disposal fee of 100 per megawatthour of net nuclear generation or 3 million per year the doe projects that it will not begin accepting spent fuel until 2017 at the earliest

we provide additional information concerning nuclearfuel costs and the storage and movement of spent fuel in notes 14 and 16 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

power pools 

sdge is a participant in the western systems power pool which includes an electricpower and transmissionrate agreement with utilities and power agencies located throughout the united states and canada more than 300 investorowned and municipal utilities state and federal power agencies energy brokers and power marketers share power and information in order to increase efficiency and competition in the bulk power market participants are able to make power transactions on standardized terms preapproved by the ferc 

transmission arrangements 

sdges 500kv southwest powerlink transmission line which is shared with arizona public service company and imperial irrigation district extends from palo verde arizona to san diego california sdges share of the line is 1162 mw although it can be less under certain system conditions 

mexicos baja california norte system is connected to sdges system via two 230kv interconnections with firm capability of 408 mw in the north to south direction and 800 mw in the south to north direction 

in december 2008 the cpuc approved sdge’s sunrise powerlink a new 120mile 500kv transmission line between the existing imperial valley substation and a new central substation to be located within the sdge system sdge is in the final engineering design and procurement phase sdge expects the line to be in commercial operation in 2012 the sunrise powerlink is designed to have a rating of 1000 mw we provide further discussion in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

transmission access 

the national energy policy act governs procedures for requests for transmission service the ferc approved the california investorowned utilities ious transfer of operation and control of their transmission facilities to the independent system operator iso in 1998 we provide additional information regarding the ferc and transmission issues in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

rates and regulation – sempra utilities 

we provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to the sempra utilities in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

sempra global 

sempra global is a holding company for most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to california utility regulation sempra global includes sempra commodities sempra generation sempra pipelines  storage and sempra lng we provide descriptions of these business units and information concerning their operations under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1 3 4 5 16 and 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

competition 

sempra energy’s nonutility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar products and services they are engaged in highly competitive activities that require significant capital investments and highly skilled and experienced personnel many of their competitors may have significantly greater financial personnel and other resources than sempra global 

sempra commodities 

sempra commodities is primarily comprised of our investment in rbs sempra commodities a joint venture formed in april 2008 this partnership is discussed in notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report this business unit also includes sempra rockies marketing which holds firm service capacity on the rockies express pipeline 

all aspects of rbs sempra commodities’ business are intensely competitive and are expected to remain so sources of competition include the following

§

other brokers and dealers

§

investment banking firms

§

energy companies and

§

other companies that offer similar products and services in the us and globally 

rbs sempra commodities’ competition is based on a number of factors including transaction execution products and services innovation reputation and price 

rbs sempra commodities also faces intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees rbs sempra commodities’ ability to compete effectively will depend upon the ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees 

rbs sempra commodities’ competitors include goldman sachs jpmorgan morgan stanley and barclay’s capital 

sempra generation 

for sales of noncontracted power sempra generation is subject to competition from energy marketers utilities industrial companies and other independent power producers for a number of years natural gas has been the fuel of choice for new power generation facilities for economic operational and environmental reasons while natural gasfired facilities will continue to be an important part of the nation’s generation portfolio some regulated utilities are now constructing units powered by renewable resources often with subsidies or under legislative mandate these utilities generally have a lower cost of capital than most independent power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms this recovery allows them to build buy and upgrade generation without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments

when sempra generation sells power not subject to longterm contract commitments it is exposed to market fluctuations in prices based on a number of factors including the amount of capacity available to meet demand the price and availability of fuel and the presence of transmission constraints some of sempra generation’s competitors such as electric utilities and generation companies have their own generation capacity including nuclear generation these companies generally larger than sempra generation may have a lower cost of capital and may have competitive advantages as a result of their scale and the location of their generation facilities 

sempra generation’s competitors include

 sempra pipelines  storage 

within its market area sempra pipelines  storage’s natural gas storage facilities and pipelines compete with other storage facilities and pipelines both regulated and unregulated systems it competes primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and connections to downstream markets 

sempra pipelines  storage’s competitors include

 sempra lng 

new supplies to meet north america’s natural gas demand may be developed from a combination of the following sources

§

existing producing basins in the united states canada and mexico

§

frontier basins in alaska northern canada and offshore deepwater

§

areas currently restricted from exploration and development due to public policies such as areas in the rocky mountains and offshore atlantic pacific and gulf of mexico coasts and

§

imported lng

in addition the demand for energy currently met by natural gas could alternatively be met by other energy forms such as coal hydroelectric oil wind solar and nuclear energy sempra lng will therefore face competition from each of these energy sources 

sempra lng competes with other companies to construct and operate lng receiving terminals according to the ferc as of october 31 2008 there were 10 existing lng terminals in north america there are six terminals currently under construction in addition as of december 31 2008 there were 66 lng receiving terminals in 18 countries there are also other proposed lng receiving terminals worldwide with which sempra lng will compete to be the most economical delivery point for lng production of both longterm contracted and spot volumes 

sempra lng’s us competitors include 

 environmental matters 

we discuss environmental issues affecting us in notes 14 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report you should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions

hazardous substances 

in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism allowing californias ious to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites including those related to certain superfund sites this mechanism permits the sempra utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses in addition the sempra utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates

at december 31 2008 we had accrued estimated remaining investigation and remediation liabilities of 05 million at sdge and 398 million at socalgas both related to hazardous waste sites these accruals include costs for numerous locations that had been manufacturedgas plants for which the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism authorizes us to recover 90 percent this estimated cost excludes remediation costs of 73 million associated with sdges former fossilfuel power plants and another location for which the cleanup costs are not being recovered in rates we believe that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

we record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable in addition we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets

air and water quality 

the transmission and distribution of natural gas require the operation of compressor stations which are subject to increasingly stringent airquality standards such as those established by the carb we discuss these standards in government regulation – california utility regulation above the sempra utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other owners of songs have an agreement with the california coastal commission to mitigate the environmental damage to the marine environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs sdges share of the mitigation costs is estimated to be 50 million of which 303 million had been incurred through december 31 2008 and 197 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050 in 2008 an artificial kelp reef project was completed the remaining costs are to complete a wetlands project and maintain both projects through 2050

other matters 

employees of registrants 

as of december 31 each company had the following number of employees

 labor relations 

field technical and most clerical employees at socalgas are represented by the utility workers union of america or the international chemical workers union council the collective bargaining agreement for these employees covering wages hours working conditions and medical and other benefit plans expired on september 30 2008 on january 31 2009 socalgas and representatives of the unions reached a tentative agreement for a new collective bargaining agreement to allow time for ratification of the collective bargaining agreement by the employees it was also agreed to extend the terms and conditions of the existing contract through february 28 2009

field technical and some clerical employees at sdge are represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers the collective bargaining agreement for these employees covering wages hours and working conditions is in effect through august 31 2011 for these same employees the agreement covering health and welfare benefits is in effect through december 31 2010 and the agreement covering pension benefits is in effect through december 4 2009 




 item 1a risk factors

when evaluating our company and its subsidiaries you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report these risk factors could affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf other risks and uncertainties in addition to those that are described below may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occurs our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed in addition the trading price of our securities could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning our company set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report 

sempra energys cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries 

sempra energys ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources in the long term cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own capital expenditures and longterm debt obligations in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including as a result of legislation or regulation or in times of financial distress 

our businesses may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations and on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and refund outstanding debt

the credit markets and financial services industry have been experiencing a period of extreme worldwide turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of many financial institutions and by extraordinary levels of government intervention

limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult credit markets we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support business activities this could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of funding both of which could reduce our shortterm and longterm profitability

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings if the credit ratings of socalgas or sdge were to be reduced their businesses could be adversely affected and any reduction in sempra energys ratings could adversely affect its nonutility subsidiaries

risks related to all sempra energy subsidiaries 

our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation 

in recent years the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on both federal and state levels these changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses moreover existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities future changes in laws and regulations may have a detrimental effect on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the sempra utilities and other sempra energy operations these rules are commonly referred to as the affiliate transaction rules these businesses could be adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional cpuc or ferc rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas or to trade with the sempra utilities and with each other affiliate transaction rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the sempra utilities any such restrictions or approval requirements could adversely affect the lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or trading operations of our subsidiaries

sempra generation has various proceedings inquiries and investigations relating to its business activities currently pending before the ferc a description of such proceedings inquiries and investigations is provided in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

our businesses require numerous permits and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals could cause our sales to decline andor our costs to increase 

all of our existing and planned development projects require multiple permits the acquisition ownership and operation of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and electric generation facilities require numerous permits approvals and certificates from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to operate our facilities or we may be forced to incur additional costs 

our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection including in particular global warming and greenhouse gas ghg emissions we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements we must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring pollution 

control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees in addition we are generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our electric generation facilities and other energy projects regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws we may be subject to penalties fines andor curtailments of our operations 

the scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations including their effects on our current operations and future expansions are difficult to predict increasing international national regional and statelevel concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial effects on our operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansion in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed national and international legislation and regulation relating to ghg emissions including carbon dioxide methane nitrogen oxide hydrofluorocarbon perfluorocarbon and sulfur hexafluoride may limit or otherwise adversely affect our operations the implementation of recent california legislation and proposed federal legislation may adversely affect our unregulated businesses by imposing additional costs associated with emission limits and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits similarly the sempra utilities may be affected if costs are not recoverable in rates the effects of significantly tougher standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth in addition sdge may be subject to penalties if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met we provide further discussion of these matters in notes 14 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report

in addition existing and future laws and regulation on mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates or other emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees and taxes that could adversely affect us moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may adversely affect us and our facilities and operations we provide additional information about these matters in note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our business earnings and cash flows 

like other major industrial facilities ours may be damaged by natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism such facilities include

 such incidents could result in severe business disruptions significant decreases in revenues or significant additional costs to us any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition earnings and cash flows 

depending on the nature and location of the facilities affected any such incident also could cause fires leaks explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties or cause personal injuries any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us insurance coverage may become unavailable for certain of these risks and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities which could materially adversely affect our financial condition earnings and cash flows

our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against us 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits we have spent and continue to spend substantial amounts defending these lawsuits and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings in particular sdge is subject to numerous lawsuits arising out of san diego county wildfires in 2007 and sempra generation is subject to extensive litigation regarding a major longterm power agreement we discuss these and other litigation in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report the uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters in addition california juries have demonstrated an increasing willingness to grant large awards including punitive damages in personal injury product liability property damage and other claims accordingly actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and could materially adversely affect our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

we discuss these proceedings in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report 

risks related to the sempra utilities 

the sempra utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislation and regulatory authorities which may adversely affect the operations performance and growth of their businesses 

the cpuc regulates the sempra utilities rates except sdges electric transmission rates which are regulated by the ferc the cpuc also regulates the sempra utilities 

 the cpuc conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance compliance with cpuc regulations and standards affiliate relationships and other matters these reviews and audits may result in disallowances and penalties that could adversely affect earnings and cash flows we discuss various cpuc proceedings relating to the sempra utilities rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report 

the sempra utilities may spend funds related to a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval if the project does not receive regulatory approval or if management decides not to proceed with the project they may not be able to recover all amounts spent for that project which could adversely affect earnings and cash flows

the cpuc periodically approves the sempra utilities rates based on authorized capital expenditures operating costs and an authorized rate of return on investment if actual capital expenditures and operating costs were to exceed the amount approved by the cpuc earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected

the cpuc applies performancebased measures and incentive mechanisms to all california utilities under these income potential above authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals rather than relying solely on expanding utility plant to increase earnings at the sempra utilities the areas that are eligible for incentives are operational activities such as employee safety energy efficiency programs and at socalgas natural gas procurement although the sempra utilities have received incentive awards in the past there can be no assurance that they will receive awards in the future or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods additionally if the sempra utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances or penalties which could negatively affect earnings and cash flows socalgas is also eligible for incentives but is not subject to penalties associated with unbundled gas storage activities

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on transmission investments and other similar matters involving sdge 

the sempra utilities may be adversely affected by new regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc the ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how they operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require them to incur additional expenses

the construction and expansion of the sempra utilities natural gas pipelines socalgas storage facilities and sdges electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits and approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies if there are delays in obtaining required approvals or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations the sempra utilities business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its ownership of nuclear facilities 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in songs a 2150mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california operated by southern california edison company the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities sdges ownership interest in songs subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation which include

§

the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials

§

limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations and

§

uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of replacing steam generators or other equipment and the decommissioning of nuclear plants

risks related to our electric generation lng pipelines  storage and other businesses 

our businesses are exposed to market risk and our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity market prices that are beyond our control 

sempra generation generates electricity that it sells under longterm contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets it purchases natural gas to fuel its power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy its contractual obligations as part of its risk management strategy sempra generation may hedge a substantial portion of its electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage its portfolio 

we buy energyrelated and other commodities from time to time for power plants or for lng regasification terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas lng or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated and other commodities result from multiple factors including 

§

weather conditions 

§

seasonality 

§

changes in supply and demand 

§

transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies 

§

availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources 

§

commodity production levels

§

expropriation of assets by foreign countries 

the ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate in 2001 the ferc imposed price limitations that resulted in unexpected moves in electricity prices in the future the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and as a result may have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

the acquisition development and construction of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

§

negotiation of satisfactory engineering procurement and construction agreements 

§

negotiation of supply and natural gas sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements 

§

receipt of required governmental permits 

§

timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by 

§

unforeseen engineering problems 

§

construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls 

§

work stoppages 

§

equipment supply 

§

adverse weather conditions 

§

environmental and geological conditions 

§

other factors 

if we are unable to complete the development of a facility we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of generation or regasification and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification storage and transmission systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to operating facilities below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties such occurrences could adversely affect our business cash flows and results of operations

we may elect not to or may not be able to enter into longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for our projects which would subject our sales to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries have become highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements such as the 10year power sales agreement between sempra generation and the dwr that expires in 2011 our sales may be subject to increased price volatility as a result we may be unable to sell the power generated by sempra generations facilities or operate those facilities profitably 

sempra lng utilizes its regasification terminals by entering into longterm firm capacity service agreements under these agreements customers pay sempra lng fees to use its facilities to regasify the customers lng sempra lng also may enter into longterm supply agreements to purchase lng which is regasified at its terminals for sale to other parties the longterm supply agreement contracts are expected to substantially reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying supply prices to prevailing natural gas price market indices however if sempra lng is unable to obtain sufficient longterm agreements or if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition reduced availability of lng to the united states due to inadequate supplies increased demand and higher prices in other countries and delays in the development of new liquefaction capacity could affect the timing of development 

of new lng facilities and expansion of existing facilities these conditions also are likely to delay nearterm attainment of fullcapacity utilization at our facilities our potential lng suppliers also may be subject to international political and economic pressures and risks which may also affect the supply of lng 

sempra pipelines  storages natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on supplies of natural gas from their transportation customers which may include sempra lng facilities

our businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements if they fail to perform we could incur substantial expenses and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility which could adversely affect our liquidity cash flows and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements will not perform their obligations under such agreements should they fail to perform we may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such event we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition we often extend credit to counterparties and customers while we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 

sempra lngs obligations and those of its suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to 1 suspension or termination for force majeure events beyond the control of the parties and 2 substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of capital for breach of the agreements

if californias dwr were to succeed in setting aside or were to fail to perform its obligations under its longterm power contract with sempra generation our business results of operations and cash flows will be materially adversely affected 

in 2001 sempra generation entered into a 10year power sales agreement with the dwr to supply up to 1900 mw to the state the validity of the power sales agreement with the dwr continues to be the subject of extensive litigation between the parties before the ferc in the courts and in arbitration proceedings if the dwr were to succeed in setting aside its obligations under the contract or if the dwr fails or is unable to meet its contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition these proceedings are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report as described in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we unilaterally reduced our price to the dwr in connection with an agreement to settle other litigation

we rely on transportation assets and services that we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to

1 deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets 

2 supply natural gas to our electric generation facilities and 

3 provide retail energy services to customers 

sempra pipelines  storage also depends on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra lng also relies on specialized ships to transport lng to its facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate our ability to sell and deliver our products and services may be hindered as a result we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at thencurrent spot market rates

we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices therefore our hedging procedures may not work as planned 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations we may enter into contracts to hedge our purchase and sale commitments inventories of natural gas and electric generation capacity as part of this strategy 

we may use fixedprice forward physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and options however we do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions and the coverage will vary over time to the extent we have unhedged positions or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

although we have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by the companies or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect us from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would negatively affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

our international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

we have interests in electricity generation and transmission natural gas distribution and transportation and lng terminal projects in mexico sempra pipelines  storage has ownership interests in electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in argentina chile and peru we have an ownership interest in rbs sempra commodities which has trading marketing and risk management operations in canada europe and asia developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political legal and financial risks that vary by country including

§

changes in foreign laws and regulations including tax and environmental laws and regulations and us laws and regulations related to foreign operations

§

high rates of inflation

§

changes in government policies or personnel

§

trade restrictions

§

limitations on us company ownership in foreign countries

§

permitting and regulatory compliance

§

changes in labor supply and labor relations in operations outside the us

§

adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals challenges to permits difficulty in enforcing contractual rights and unsettled property rights and titles in mexico and other foreign jurisdictions

§

general political economic and business conditions 

our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in increased taxes in foreign countries while sempra pipelines  storage believes that it has contracts and other measures in place to mitigate its most significant foreign currency exchange risks some exposure is not fully mitigated

other risks 

sempra energy has substantial investments and other obligations in businesses that it does not control or manage 

sempra energy is a partner with the royal bank of scotland rbs in rbs sempra commodities a commoditiesmarketing firm in which we invested 16 billion rbs which has been greatly affected by the worldwide turmoil in banking and is now indirectly controlled by the government of the united kingdom is obligated to provide all of the additional capital required for the operation and expansion of the commoditiesmarketing business 

we also own a 25percent interest in rockies express a joint venture which is completing construction of a 1679mile natural gas pipeline at an estimated cost of approximately 62 billion rockies express is controlled by kinder morgan energy partners which holds a 51percent interest

we have also guaranteed a portion of the debt and other obligations of rbs sempra commodities and debt of rockies express as we discuss in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report we also have smaller investments in other entities that we do not control or manage

we do not control and have limited influence over these businesses and their management in addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses it could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

risk factors 

the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report should be considered carefully when evaluating the company these risk factors could affect the actual results of the company and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company other risks and uncertainties in addition to those that are described below may also impair its business operations if any of the following risks occurs the companys business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed in addition the trading price of its securities could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning the company set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2007 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference in this report 

risks related to the sempra utilities 

the sempra utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislation and regulatory authorities which may adversely affect the operations performance and growth of their businesses 

the california public utilities commission cpuc which consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for staggered sixyear terms regulates the sempra utilities rates except electric transmission rates which are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and conditions of service sales of securities capital structure rates of return rates of depreciation the uniform systems of accounts and longterm resource procurement the cpuc conducts various reviews of utility performance which may include reasonableness and prudency reviews of capital expenditures natural gas and electricity procurement and other costs and reviews and audits of the companys records and affiliate relationships and conducts audits and investigations into various matters which may from time to time result in disallowances and penalties adversely affecting earnings and cash flows various proceedings involving the cpuc and relating to the sempra utilities rates costs incentive mechanisms and performancebased regulation are discussed in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the sempra utilities may expend funds prior to receiving regulatory approval to proceed with a major capital project if the project does not receive regulatory approval or management decides not to proceed with the project the company may not be able to recover the amount expended for that project

periodically the sempra utilities rates are approved by the cpuc based on authorized capital expenditures and operating costs if the sempra utilities actual capital expenditures and operating costs were to exceed the amount approved by the cpuc it could adversely affect earnings and cash flows

to promote efficient operations and improved productivity and to move away from reasonableness reviews and disallowances the cpuc applies performancebased regulation pbr to the sempra utilities under pbr regulators require future income potential to be tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating income goals rather than relying solely on expanding utility plant to increase earnings the areas that are eligible for pbr rewards are operational incentives based on measurements of safety reliability and customer service energy efficiency rewards based on the effectiveness of the programs and natural gas procurement rewards although the sempra utilities have received pbr rewards in the past there can be no assurance that they will receive rewards in the future 

or that they would be of comparable amounts additionally if the sempra utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under the pbr mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances or penalties which could negatively affect earnings and cash flows

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on transmission investments and other similar matters involving sdge 

the sempra utilities may be adversely affected by new regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how the sempra utilities operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require the sempra utilities to incur additional expenses

the construction and expansion of the sempra utilities natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits and approvals from federal state and local governmental agencies if there are delays in obtaining required approvals or if the company fails to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations its business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its ownership of nuclear facilities 

sdge has a 20percent ownership interest in the san onofre nuclear generating station songs a 2150megawatt mw nuclear generating facility near san clemente california the nuclear regulatory commission nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities sdges ownership interest in songs subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation which include

·

the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials

·

limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations and

·

uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives

the sempra utilities future results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against them 

sempra energy and the sempra utilities are defendants in numerous lawsuits they have expended and continue to expend substantial amounts defending these lawsuits and in connection with related investigations and regulatory proceedings and have established reserves that they believe to be appropriate for their ultimate resolution however uncertainties inherent in complex legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving legal matters accordingly costs ultimately incurred may differ materially from estimated costs and could materially adversely affect sempra energys and the sempra utilities business cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

these proceedings are discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

risks related to sempra energys electric generation liquefied natural gas lng commodities trading pipelines  storage and other businesses 

sempra energys businesses are exposed to market risk and its financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity market prices that are beyond its control 

sempra generation generates electricity that it sells under longterm contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets it purchases natural gas to fuel its power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy its contractual obligations as part of sempra generations risk management strategy it may hedge a substantial portion of its electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage its portfolio 

sempra energys revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas lng or other commodities whether procured for power plants or lng regasification terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with trading counterparties or customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which the company competes change in a direction or manner that it has not anticipated and for which it has not provided through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions

sempra commodities generally seeks to structure its trading contracts so that a substantial majority of its trading revenues are realizable within 24 months and strives to maintain appropriate hedging mechanisms for its trading book however it may at any time have substantial unhedged trading positions in the market resulting from the management of its trading portfolios or from its inability to hedge in whole or in part particular risks 

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated and other commodities result from multiple factors including weather conditions seasonality changes in supply and demand transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources commodity production levels actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries with respect to the supply of crude oil federal state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation natural disasters wars embargoes and other catastrophic events and expropriation of assets by foreign countries 

in 2001 the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which the company operates imposed price limitations which resulted in unexpected moves in electricity prices the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time in the future any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and may have an adverse effect on sempra energys sales and results of operations 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge their assets or positions against changes in commodity prices and their hedging procedures may not work as planned 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations sempra energys subsidiaries routinely enter into contracts to hedge a substantial portion of their purchase and sale commitments and inventories of electricity natural gas crude oil and refined petroleum products base metals and other commodities as part of this strategy they routinely utilize fixedprice forward physical purchase and 

sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges however the company does not cover the entire exposure of its assets or its positions to market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time to the extent sempra energys subsidiaries have unhedged positions or if their hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

although sempra energy and its subsidiaries have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect the company from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that sempra energys risk management procedures will prevent losses that would negatively affect its business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

sempra energys businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements and any failure by them to perform could require the company to incur substantial expenses and expose it to commodity price risk and volatility which could adversely affect sempra energys liquidity cash flows and results of operations 

sempra energys subsidiaries are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements will not perform their obligations under such agreements should they fail to perform the company may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such event sempra energys subsidiaries may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition the subsidiaries often extend credit to counterparties and customers while the company performs significant credit analyses prior to extending credit sempra energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to the risk that they may not be able to collect amounts owed to them 

sempra lngs obligations and those of its suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to suspension or termination for force majeure events beyond the control of the parties and to substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery for breach of the agreements

if californias department of water resources dwr were to succeed in setting aside or were to fail to perform its obligations under its longterm power contract with sempra generation sempra energys business results of operations and cash flows will be materially adversely affected 

in 2001 sempra generation entered into a 10year power sales agreement with the dwr to supply up to 1900 mw to the state the validity of the power sales agreement with the dwr continues to be the subject of extensive litigation between the parties before the ferc in the courts and in arbitration proceedings if the dwr were to succeed in setting aside its obligations under the contract or if the dwr fails or is unable to meet its contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys business results of operations cash flows and financial condition these proceedings are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as described in note 16 of 

the notes to consolidated financial statements the company unilaterally reduced its price to the dwr in connection with the agreement to settle other litigation

sempra energys subsidiaries may elect not to or may not be able to enter into longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for their projects which would subject their sales to increased volatility and its businesses to increased competition 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries have become highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements such as the 10year power sales agreement between sempra generation and the dwr expiring in 2011 sempra energys sales may be subject to increased price volatility and it may be unable to sell the power generated by sempra generations facilities or operate those facilities profitably 

sempra lng intends to utilize its regasification terminals by entering into longterm firm capacity service agreements whereby customers would pay sempra lng fees to use sempra lngs facilities to regasify the customers lng or by entering into longterm supply agreements for the purchase of lng to be regasified at its terminals for sale to other parties in the case of longterm supply agreements these contracts are expected to substantially reduce its exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying supply prices to prevailing natural gas price market indices however if sempra lng is unable to obtain such longterm agreements or if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition reduced availability of lng due to inadequate supplies delays in the development of new liquefaction capacity and increased demand are affecting the timing of development of new lng facilities and expansion of existing facilities and are likely to delay nearterm attainment of fullcapacity utilization when facilities under construction become operational the companys potential lng suppliers also may be subject to international political and economic pressures and risks which may also affect the supply of lng 

sempra pipelines  storages natural gas pipeline operations will be dependent on supplies of natural gas from their transportation customers which may include sempra lng facilities

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled which could increase sempra energys costs and impair its ability to recover its investments 

the acquisition development and construction of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks sempra energy and its subsidiaries may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built sempra energys success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things negotiation of satisfactory engineering procurement and construction agreements negotiation of supply and natural gas sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements receipt of required governmental permits and timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by unforeseen engineering problems construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls work stoppages equipment supply adverse weather conditions environmental and geological conditions and other factors if the company is unable to complete the development of a facility it typically will not be able to recover its investment in the project 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of generation or regasification and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification storage and transmission systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to operating facilities below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties and could adversely affect sempra energys business cash flows and results of operations

sempra energys subsidiaries rely on transportation assets and services that they do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

sempra energys subsidiaries depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas they sell to wholesale markets to supply natural gas to their electric generation facilities and to provide retail energy services to customers sempra pipelines  storage also depends on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra lng also will rely on specialized lng ships to transport lng to its lng facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate the ability of sempra energys subsidiaries to sell and deliver their products and services may be hindered as a result they may be responsible for damages incurred by their customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at thencurrent spot market rates

sempra energys businesses require numerous permits and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies and any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals could cause sempra energys sales to decline andor its costs to increase 

the acquisition ownership and operation of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and electric generation facilities require numerous permits approvals and certificates from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies all of the existing and planned development projects of sempra energys subsidiaries require multiple permits if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if the company fails to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations it may not be able to operate its facilities or it may be forced to incur additional costs 

sempra energys businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation 

in recent years the regulatory environment applicable to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on both federal and state levels which have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and sempra energy cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on its businesses moreover existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to the company and its facilities future changes in laws and regulations may have a detrimental effect on sempra energys business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

sempra energys other operations are subject to affiliate rules relating to transactions with the sempra utilities and with each other these businesses could be adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional cpuc or ferc rules further restricting their ability to sell electricity or natural gas or to trade with the sempra utilities and with each other affiliate transaction rules also could require these 

businesses to obtain the prior approval of the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the sempra utilities any such restrictions or approval requirements could adversely affect the lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation facilities or trading operations of the companys subsidiaries

various proceedings inquiries and investigations relating to the business activities of sempra generation and sempra commodities are currently pending before the ferc a description of such proceedings inquiries and investigations is provided in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

sempra energys international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

sempra energy subsidiaries have interests in electricity generation natural gas distribution and transmission and lng terminal projects in mexico and also have trading marketing and risk management operations in canada europe and asia sempra pipelines  storage has ownership interests in electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in argentina chile and peru developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject the company to significant political legal and financial risks which vary by country including

·

changes in foreign laws and regulations including tax and environmental laws and regulations and us laws and regulations related to foreign operations

·

high rates of inflation

·

changes in government policies or personnel

·

trade restrictions

·

limitations on us company ownership in foreign countries

·

permitting and regulatory compliance

·

changes in labor supply and labor relations in operations outside the us

·

adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals challenges to permits difficulty in enforcing contractual rights and unsettled property rights and titles in mexico and other foreign jurisdictions and

·

general political economic and business conditions 

sempra energys international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries while sempra pipelines  storage believes that it has contracts and other measures in place to mitigate its most significant foreign currency exchange risks it has some exposure that is not fully mitigated

a downgrade in sempra energys credit ratings could negatively affect its commodities trading and other nonutility businesses 

if sempra energys credit ratings were to be downgraded the business prospects of its commodities trading and other nonutility businesses which generally rely on the creditworthiness of sempra energy would be adversely affected sempra commodities would be required to comply with various margin or other credit enhancement obligations under its trading and marketing contracts substantially all of which are guaranteed by sempra energy and it may be unable to continue to trade or able to do so only on lessfavorable terms to meet liquidity requirements sempra energy and its subsidiaries maintain substantial unused committed lines of credit for which borrowings are available without regard to credit ratings however a ratings downgrade could require sempra energy to divert to sempra commodities all or a portion of the liquidity that these lines would otherwise provide for the expansion of sempra energys other nonutility businesses in addition if these lines were to become unavailable or to be inadequate to meet margin and other credit enhancement requirements sempra commodities’ trading partners could exercise other remedies such as liquidating and netting their exposures to sempra commodities making it more difficult or impossible for sempra commodities to manage effectively its remaining trading positions or to continue its trading business and sempra energy and its subsidiaries may not have sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations

under the terms of the agreement for the pending joint venture transaction with rbs rbs will provide all credit support for the commoditiesmarketing business and that business will no longer be dependent on sempra energy’s credit ratings additional information is provided in sempra global  joint venture agreement with rbs

other risks related to the company 

sempra energys businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could adversely affect sempra energys profitability 

sempra energys subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection including in particular global warming and greenhouse gas ghg emissions they are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses and other approvals to construct and operate their businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements they must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment mitigation costs and emissions fees the company also is generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of its electric generation facilities and other energy projects regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown if sempra energys subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable environmental laws they may be subject to penalties fines andor curtailments of their operations 

the scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations including their effects on current operations and future expansions are difficult to predict increasing international national regional and statelevel concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial effects on operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansion in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed national and international legislation and regulation relating to ghg emissions including carbon dioxide methane nitrogen oxide hydrofluorocarbon perfluorocarbon and sulfur hexafluoride may limit or otherwise adversely affect the operations of sempra energy and its subsidiaries the implementation of recent california legislation and proposed federal legislation may adversely affect sempra energys unregulated businesses by imposing additional costs associated with emission limits and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emission credits similarly the sempra utilities may be affected if costs are not recoverable in rates and because the effects 

of significantly tougher standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth in addition sdge may be subject to penalties if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met further discussion of these matters is provided in notes 14 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in addition existing and future laws and regulation on mercury nitrogen and sulfur oxides particulates or other emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees and taxes that could adversely affect sempra energys subsidiaries moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may adversely affect the company and its facilities and operations additional information on these matters is provided in note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect sempra energys business earnings and cash flows 

like other major industrial facilities sempra energys generation facilities electric transmission and distribution facilities lng receipt terminals and storage facilities chartered oil and lng tankers and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities may be damaged by natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism any such incidents could result in severe business disruptions significant decreases in revenues or significant additional costs to the company which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition earnings and cash flows given the nature and location of these facilities any such incidents also could cause fires leaks explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties or personal injuries which could lead to significant claims against the company and its subsidiaries insurance coverage may become unavailable for certain of these risks and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or damage to any of its facilities or for any loss of or damage to natural resources or property or personal injuries caused by its operations may be insufficient to cover the companys losses or liabilities without materially adversely affecting the companys financial condition earnings and cash flows

sempra energys cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries 

the companys ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations is dependent on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources cash flows from the subsidiaries are dependent in the long term on the ability of the subsidiaries to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own capital expenditures and longterm debt obligations in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including as a result of legislation or regulation or in times of financial distress 

government regulation 

the most significant government regulation affecting sempra energy is the regulation of its utility subsidiaries

california utility regulation 

the cpuc which consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for staggered sixyear terms regulates sdges and socalgas rates and conditions of service sales of securities rates of return capital structure rates of depreciation uniform systems of accounts and longterm resource procurement except as described below under united states utility regulation the cpuc also has 

jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric transmission electric distribution and natural gas transmission and distribution facilities the cpuc conducts various reviews of utility performance conducts audits for compliance with regulatory guidelines and conducts investigations into various matters such as deregulation competition and the environment to determine its future policies the cpuc also regulates the interactions and transactions of the sempra utilities with sempra energy and its affiliates further discussion is provided in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the california energy commission cec establishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based upon these forecasts the cec determines the need for additional energy sources and for conservation programs the cec sponsors alternativeenergy research and development projects promotes energy conservation programs and maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages in addition the cec certifies powerplant sites and related facilities within california

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of supply availability and prices for every market sector consuming natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is used to support longterm investment decisions

california assembly bill 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 makes the california air resources board carb responsible for monitoring and reducing ghg emissions the bill requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission reductions including among other things a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a part of the california environmental protection agency an organization which reports directly to the governors office in the executive branch of california state government 

united states utility regulation 

the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access rates of return on transmission investment the uniform systems of accounts rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale 

the nrc oversees the licensing construction and operation of nuclear facilities in the united states nrc regulations require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities periodically the nrc requires that newly developed data and techniques be used to reanalyze the design of a nuclear power plant and as a result requires plant modifications as a condition of continued operation in some cases

local regulation 

socalgas has natural gas franchises with the 241 legal jurisdictions in its service territory these franchises allow socalgas to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas in public places some franchises such as that for the city of los angeles which expires in 2012 have fixed expiration dates ranging from 2008 to 2048 most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration date 

sdge has electric franchises with the two counties and the 26 cities in its electric service territory and natural gas franchises with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory these franchises allow sdge to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity andor natural gas in public places most of the franchises have indefinite lives except for the 

electric and natural gas franchises with the cities of with expiration dates as indicated encinitas 2012 chula vista 2015 san diego 2020 and coronado 2028 and the natural gas franchises with the county of san diego 2029 and the city of escondido 2035 

sempra generation sempra lng and sempra pipelines  storage have operations in nevada arizona california and louisiana these entities are subject to state and local laws and regulations in the states in which they operate 

other regulation 

sempra commodities operations are subject to regulation by the new york mercantile exchange the london metal exchange the commodity futures trading commission the ferc and the national futures association it also has trading locations in canada europe and asia that are subject to regulation as to operations and financial position by bodies such as the uk financial services authority fsa and liffe the international derivatives business of nyse euronext upon completion of the joint venture transaction with rbs the joint venture partnership will also be subject to regulation by the federal reserve board 

sempra generation and sempra lng have operations in the united states that are subject to regulation by the ferc

sempra pipelines  storages mexican utilities build and operate natural gas distribution systems in mexicali chihuahua and the la lagunadurango zone in northcentral mexico and its pipelines transport gas from the us border to baja california mexico sempra generation operates a natural gasfired power plant in baja california mexico sempra lng’s energía costa azul receipt terminal is currently being developed in baja california mexico these operations are subject to regulation by the comisión reguladora de energía and by the labor and environmental agencies of city state and federal governments in mexico 

licenses and permits 

the sempra utilities obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity they require periodic renewal which results in continuing regulation by the granting agency 

the companys other subsidiaries are also required to obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in the normal course of business some of these permits authorizations and licenses require periodic renewal 

sempra generation and its subsidiaries obtain a number of permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities and in connection with wholesale distribution of electricity sempra pipelines  storage’s mexican subsidiaries obtain construction permits for their natural gas distribution and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided sempra pipelines  storage obtains licenses and permits for natural gas storage facilities and pipelines sempra lng obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of lng facilities

other regulatory matters are described in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

california natural gas utility operations 

the company is engaged in the purchase sale distribution storage and transportation of natural gas through the sempra utilities the companys resource planning natural gas procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters are discussed below and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

customers 

for regulatory purposes customers are classified as either core or noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers without alternative fuel capability noncore customers consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from the sempra utilities while customers are permitted to aggregate their natural gas requirement and purchase directly from brokers or producers the sempra utilities continue to be obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of core customers

natural gas procurement and transportation 

most of the natural gas purchased and delivered by the sempra utilities is produced outside of california primarily in the southwestern us us rockies and canada the sempra utilities purchase natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts which are primarily based on monthly spotmarket prices

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to the distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of its customers socalgas is committed to firm pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation entitlements socalgas sells excess capacity on a shortterm basis interstate pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company and kern river gas transmission provide transportation services into socalgas intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services are regulated by the ferc 

sdge has natural gas transportation contracts with various interstate pipelines that expire on various dates between 2008 and 2023 sdge currently purchases natural gas on a spot basis from canada the us rockies and the southwestern us to fill its longterm pipeline capacity and purchases additional spotmarket supplies delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements all of sdges natural gas is delivered through socalgas pipelines under a longterm transportation agreement in addition under separate agreements expiring in march 2008 socalgas provides sdge up to nine billion cubic feet bcf of storage capacity a december 2007 cpuc decision directs that effective april 1 2008 natural gas procurement for both sdge’s and socalgas’ natural gas core customers be combined into a single supply portfolio to be administered by socalgas all sdge assets associated with its core customer natural gas supply portfolio will be transferred or assigned to socalgas

natural gas storage 

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for use by core noncore and offsystem customers sempra utilities’ customers are allocated a portion of socalgas storage capacity other customers can bid and negotiate the desired amount of storage on a contract basis the storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to purchase and store natural gas when natural gas costs are low usually during the summer to reduce winter purchases when natural gas costs are generally higher this allows customers to select the level of service they desire to better manage their fuel procurement and transportation needs 

demand for natural gas 

the sempra utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on the customers preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products in the noncore industrial market some customers are capable of using alternate fuels which can affect the demand for natural gas the companys ability to maintain its industrial market share is largely dependent on the relative spread between energy prices the demand for natural gas by electric generators is influenced by a number of factors in the shortterm natural gas use by electric generators is impacted by the availability of alternative sources of generation the availability of hydroelectricity is highly dependent on precipitation in the western us and canada in addition natural gas use is impacted by the performance of other generation sources in the western us including nuclear and coal renewable energy and other natural gas facilities outside the service area natural gas use is also impacted by changes in enduse electricity demand for example natural gas use generally increases during extended heat waves over the longterm natural gas used to generate electricity will be influenced by additional factors such as the location of new power plant construction and the development of renewable energy resources recently more generation capacity has been constructed outside southern california than within the sempra utilities service area this new generation will displace the output of older lessefficient local generation reducing the use of natural gas for local electric generation over the next few years however construction and planned construction of smaller natural gasfired peaking and other electric generation facilities within the sempra utilities’ service area are expected to result in a slight overall increase in the demand for local natural gas for electric generation

effective march 31 1998 electric industry restructuring provided outofstate producers the option to provide power to california utility customers as a result natural gas demand for electric generation within southern california competes with electric power generated throughout the western us natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be significantly affected to the extent that regulatory changes and electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the companys service area

growth in the natural gas markets is largely dependent upon the health and expansion of the southern california economy and prices of other energy products external factors such as weather the price of electricity electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable energy resources development of new natural gas supply sources and general economic conditions can result in significant shifts in demand and market price the sempra utilities added 62000 and 85000 new customer meters in 2007 and 2006 respectively representing growth rates of 10 percent and 13 percent respectively the sempra utilities expect that their growth rate for 2008 will approximate that of 2007

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal in nature and revenues generally are greater during the winter months as is prevalent in the industry the company injects natural gas into storage during the 

summer months usually april through october for withdrawal from storage during the winter months usually november through march when customer demand is higher

electric utility operations 

customers 

at december 31 2007 sdge had 14 million customer meters consisting of 1210600 residential 146300 commercial 500 industrial 2000 street and highway lighting and 5400 direct access the companys service area covers 4100 square miles the company added 10000 new electric customer meters in 2007 and 17000 in 2006 representing growth rates of 07 percent and 13 percent respectively the company expects that its growth rate for 2008 will approximate that of 2007

competition 

sempra energy’s nonutility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar products and services most activities in which the company is engaged are very competitive and require significant capital investments and highly skilled and experienced personnel to compete many of sempra global’s competitors may have significantly greater financial personnel and other resources than the company

sempra commodities 

all aspects of sempra commodities’ business are intensely competitive and are expected to remain so sempra commodities’ competitors are other brokers and dealers investment banking firms energy companies and other companies that offer similar products and services in the us and globally sempra commodities’ competition is based on a number of factors including transaction execution products and services innovation reputation and price

sempra commodities competitors include goldman sachs jp morgan and morgan stanley

sempra generation 

for sales of noncontracted power sempra generation is subject to intense competition from energy marketers utilities industrial companies and other independent power producers for a number of years natural gas has been the fuel of choice for new power generation facilities for economic operational and environmental reasons while natural gasfired facilities will continue to be an important part of the nation’s generation portfolio some regulated utilities are now constructing units powered by renewable resources often with subsidies or under legislative mandate these utilities generally have a lower cost of capital than most independent power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms allowing them to build buy and upgrade generation without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments

when sempra generation sells power not subject to longterm contract commitments it is exposed to market fluctuations in prices based on a number of factors including the amount of capacity available to meet demand the price and availability of fuel and the presence of transmission constraints some of sempra generation’s competitors such as electric utilities and distribution companies have their own generation capacity including nuclear generation these companies generally larger than sempra generation have a lower cost of capital and may have competitive advantages as a result of their scale and location of their generation facilities

sempra generation’s competitors include edison mission energy and fpl energy llc 

sempra lng 

new supplies to meet north america’s natural gas demand may be developed from a combination of the following sources

·

existing producing basins in the united states canada and mexico

·

frontier basins in alaska northern canada and offshore deepwater

·

areas currently restricted from exploration and development due to public policies such as areas in the rocky mountains and offshore atlantic pacific and gulf of mexico coasts and

·

imported lng

in addition demand for energy currently met by natural gas could alternatively be met by other energy forms such as coal hydroelectric oil wind solar and nuclear energy sempra lng will face competition from each of these energy sources

sempra lng competes with other companies to be among the first to construct lng receiving terminals in economically desirable locations according to the ferc as of october 31 2007 there were five existing lng terminals in north america as well as 39 new lng receiving terminals or expansions approved or proposed to be constructed in the us including six under construction in addition as of december 31 2007 there were 60 lng receiving terminals in 18 countries and other proposed lng receiving terminals worldwide with which sempra lng will compete to be the most economical delivery point for lng production of both longterm contracted and spot volumes

sempra lng’s us competitors include cheniere energy dominion resources el paso corporation southern union exxon mobil occidental energy ventures chevron texaco and hess lng

sempra pipelines  storage 

within its market area sempra pipelines  storage’s natural gas storage facilities and pipelines compete with other storage facilities and pipelines both regulated and unregulated systems primarily on the basis of price in terms of storage and transportation fees available capacity and connections to downstream markets

at december 31 2007 the company had accrued its estimated remaining investigation and remediation liability related to hazardous waste sites including numerous locations that had been manufacturedgas plants of 484 million of which 90 percent is authorized to be recovered through the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism this estimated cost excludes remediation costs of 6 million associated with sdges former fossilfuel power plants the company believes that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position

estimated liabilities for environmental remediation are recorded when amounts are probable and estimable amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism are recorded as a regulatory asset

air and water quality 

the transmission and distribution of natural gas require the operation of compressor stations which are subject to increasingly stringent airquality standards such as those established by the carb as discussed under government regulation – california utility regulation herein costs to comply with these standards are generally recovered in rates

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other owners of songs previously reached an agreement with the california coastal commission to mitigate the environmental damage to the marine environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs units 2 and 3 sdges share of the cost is estimated to be 36 million of which 25 million had been incurred at december 31 2007 and 11 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050 in may 2006 the cpuc adopted a decision in edisons 2006 general rate case in which decision sdge is no longer subject to a 50percent disallowance of cost recovery going forward

risks related to the sempra utilities 

the sempra utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislation and regulatory authorities which may adversely affect the operations performance and growth of their businesses 

the california public utilities commission cpuc which consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for staggered sixyear terms regulates the sempra utilities rates except electric transmission rates which are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and conditions of service sales of securities rates of return rates of depreciation the uniform systems of accounts and longterm resource procurement the cpuc conducts various reviews of utility performance which may include reasonableness and prudency reviews of capital expenditures natural gas and electricity procurement and other costs and reviews and audits of the companys records and affiliate relationships and conducts audits and investigations into various matters which may from time to time result in disallowances and penalties adversely affecting earnings and cash flows various proceedings involving the cpuc and relating to the sempra utilities rates costs incentive mechanisms performancebased regulation and compliance with affiliate and holding company rules are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for major capital programs the sempra utilities may expend funds prior to receiving regulatory approval to proceed with the capital project if the project does not receive regulatory approval or a decision is made not to proceed with the project the company may not be able to recover the amount expended for that project

periodically the sempra utilities rates are approved by the cpuc based on forecasts of capital and operating costs if the sempra utilities actual capital and operating costs were to exceed the amount approved by the cpuc it would adversely affect earnings and cash flows

to promote efficient operations and improved productivity and to move away from reasonableness reviews and disallowances the cpuc applies performancebased regulation pbr to the sempra utilities under pbr regulators require future income potential to be tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating income goals rather than relying 

solely on expanding utility plant to increase earnings the three areas that are eligible for pbr rewards are operational incentives based on measurements of safety reliability and customer satisfaction energy efficiency rewards based on the effectiveness of the programs and natural gas procurement rewards although the sempra utilities have received pbr rewards in the past there can be no assurance that they will receive rewards in the future or that they would be of comparable amounts additionally if the sempra utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under the pbr mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances or penalties which could negatively affect earnings and cash flows

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the rates of return on transmission investments and other similar matters involving sdge 

the sempra utilities may be adversely affected by new regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how the sempra utilities operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require the sempra utilities to incur additional expenses

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its ownership of nuclear facilities 

sdge owns a 20 percent interest in the san onofre nuclear generating station songs a 2150 megawatt nuclear generating facility near san clemente california the nuclear regulatory commission nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities sdges ownership interest in songs subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation which include

· 

the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials 

· 

limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations and 

· 

uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives 

the sempra utilities future results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against them 

the california energy crisis of 2000  2001 has generated numerous lawsuits governmental investigations and regulatory proceedings involving many energy companies including sempra energy and the sempra utilities during 2006 sempra energy and the sempra utilities reached agreement to settle several of these lawsuits including subject to court and other approvals the principal class action antitrust lawsuits in which they are defendants however the companies remain defendants in several additional lawsuits arising out of the energy crisis including various antitrust actions sempra energy and the sempra utilities have expended and continue to expend substantial amounts defending these lawsuits and in connection with related investigations and regulatory proceedings they have established reserves that they believe to be appropriate for the ultimate resolution of these remaining matters however uncertainties inherent in complex legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of 

resolving legal matters accordingly costs ultimately incurred may differ materially from estimated costs and could materially adversely affect sempra energys and the sempra utilities business cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

these proceedings are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

risks related to sempra energys electric generation commodities trading liquefied natural gas lng pipelines  storage and other businesses 

sempra energys businesses are exposed to market risk and its financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity market prices that are beyond its control 

sempra commodities is a fullservice trading company that markets and trades physical and financial commodity products its trading portfolios consist of physical and financial commodity contracts including contracts for natural gas power petroleum and petroleum products base metals and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash although sempra commodities generally seeks to structure its trading contracts so that a substantial majority of its trading revenues are realizable within 24 months and strives to maintain appropriate hedging mechanisms for its trading book sempra commodities may have substantial unhedged trading positions in the market resulting from the management of its trading portfolios or from its inability to hedge in whole or in part particular risks 

sempra generation generates electricity that it sells under longterm contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets it purchases natural gas to fuel its power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy its contractual obligations as part of sempra generations risk management strategy it may hedge a substantial portion of its electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage its portfolio 

sempra energys revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas lng or other commodities whether procured for power plants or lng regasification terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with trading counterparties or customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which the company competes change in a direction or manner that it has not anticipated and for which it has not provided through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated and other commodities result from multiple factors including weather conditions seasonality changes in supply and demand transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources commodity production levels actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries with respect to the supply of crude oil federal state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation natural disasters wars embargoes and other catastrophic events and expropriation of assets by foreign countries 

in 2001 the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which the company operates imposed price limitations which resulted in unexpected moves in electricity prices the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time in the future any such action by the ferc may result 

in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and may have an adverse effect on sempra energys sales and results of operations 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge their assets or positions against changes in commodity prices and their hedging procedures may not work as planned 

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations sempra energys subsidiaries routinely enter into contracts to hedge a substantial portion of their purchase and sale commitments and inventories of electricity natural gas crude oil and refined petroleum products base metals and other commodities as part of this strategy they routinely utilize fixedprice forward physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges however the company does not cover the entire exposure of its assets or its positions to market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time to the extent sempra energys subsidiaries have unhedged positions or if their hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

risk management procedures may not prevent losses 

although sempra energy and its subsidiaries have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect the company from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that sempra energys risk management procedures will prevent losses that would negatively affect its business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

a downgrade in sempra energys credit ratings could negatively affect its commodities trading and other nonutility businesses 

if sempra energys credit ratings were to be downgraded the business prospects of its commodities trading and other nonutility businesses which generally rely on the creditworthiness of sempra energy would be adversely affected sempra commodities would be required to comply with various margin or other credit enhancement obligations under its trading and marketing contracts substantially all of which are guaranteed by sempra energy and it may be unable to continue to trade or able to do so only on lessfavorable terms to meet liquidity requirements sempra energy and its subsidiaries maintain substantial unused committed lines of credit for which borrowings are available without regard to credit ratings however a ratings downgrade could require sempra energy to divert to sempra commodities all or a portion of the liquidity that these lines would otherwise provide for the expansion of sempra energys other nonutility businesses in addition if these lines were to become unavailable or to be inadequate to meet margin or other credit enhancement requirements sempra commodities trading partners could exercise other remedies such as liquidating and netting their exposures to sempra commodities making it more difficult or impossible for sempra commodities to manage effectively its remaining trading positions or to continue its trading business and sempra energy and its subsidiaries may not have sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations

sempra energys businesses depend on counterparties business partners customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements and any failure by them to perform could require the company to incur substantial expenses and expose it to commodity price risk and volatility which could adversely affect sempra energys liquidity cash flows and results of operations 

sempra energys subsidiaries are exposed to the risk that counterparties business partners customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements will not perform their obligations under such agreements should they fail to perform the company may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such event sempra energys subsidiaries may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition the subsidiaries often extend credit to counterparties and customers while the company performs significant credit analyses prior to extending credit sempra energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to the risk that they may not be able to collect amounts owed to them 

sempra lngs obligations and those of its suppliers for lng supplies are contractually subject to suspension or termination for force majeure events beyond the control of the parties and to substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery for breach of the agreements

if californias department of water resources dwr were to succeed in setting aside or were to fail to perform its obligations under its longterm power contract with sempra generation sempra energys business results of operations and cash flows will be materially adversely affected 

in 2001 sempra generation entered into a 10year power sales agreement with the dwr to supply up to 1900 megawatts to the state sempra energy expects the contract with the dwr will be a source of significant revenue over the 10year period the validity of the power sales agreement with the dwr continues to be the subject of extensive litigation between the parties before the ferc in california courts and in arbitration proceedings if the dwr were to succeed in setting aside its obligations under the contract or if the dwr fails or is unable to meet its contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys business results of operations cash flows and financial condition these proceedings are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as described in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the company unilaterally reduced its price to the dwr in connection with the agreement to settle other litigation

in the future sempra energys subsidiaries may elect not to or may not be able to enter into longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for their projects which would subject their sales to increased volatility and its businesses to increased competition 

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries have become highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements such as the 10year power sales agreement between sempra generation and the dwr sempra energys sales may be 

subject to increased price volatility and it may be unable to sell the power generated by sempra generations facilities or operate those facilities profitably 

sempra lng intends to utilize its regasification terminals by entering into longterm firm capacity service agreements whereby customers would pay sempra lng fees to use sempra lngs facilities to regasify the customers lng or by entering into longterm supply agreements for the purchase of lng to be regasified at its terminals for sale to other parties in the case of longterm supply agreements these contracts are expected to substantially reduce its exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying supply prices to prevailing natural gas price market indices however if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition sempra lng does not intend to commence significant construction of its port arthur terminal or expansion of its energía costa azul or cameron terminals until it has obtained such longterm agreements reduced availability of lng due to inadequate supplies delays in the development of new liquefaction capacity and increased demand are affecting the timing of development of new lng facilities and expansion of existing facilities and are likely to delay nearterm attainment of fullcapacity utilization when facilities under construction become operational the companys potential lng suppliers also may be subject to international political and economic pressures and risks which may also affect the supply of lng 

sempra pipelines  storages natural gas pipeline operations will be dependent on supplies of natural gas from their transportation customers which may include sempra lng facilities including the proposed cameron expansion

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled which could increase sempra energys costs and impair its ability to recover its investments 

the acquisition development and construction of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks sempra energy and its subsidiaries may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built sempra energys success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things negotiation of satisfactory engineering procurement and construction agreements negotiation of supply and natural gas sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements receipt of required governmental permits and timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by unforeseen engineering problems construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls work stoppages adverse weather conditions environmental and geological conditions and other factors if the company is unable to complete the development of a facility it typically will not be able to recover its investment in the project 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of generation or regasification and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification storage and transmission systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to operating facilities below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses 

including higher maintenance costs and penalties and could adversely affect sempra energys business cash flows and results of operations

competition among developers and operators of lng terminals has increased which may adversely affect the costs of construction and future profitability of sempra lngs proposed lng terminals 

although there are only a limited number of lng terminal facilities operating in north america today many companies have announced plans to develop lng facilities to serve the north american market some of these competitors have more operating experience more development experience larger staffs and greater financial resources than the company industry analysts have predicted that if all of the proposed lng facilities in north america that have been announced by developers are actually built there will likely be substantial excess capacity at such terminals in the near future although its lng facilities in mexico louisiana and texas are more advanced in the siting permitting and regulatory approval processes than the proposed projects of many of its competitors there can be no assurance that sempra energy will be able to maintain that advantage in addition increased development of lng terminal facilities has increased competition for the resources required for their development resulting in rising engineering and procurement costs which may adversely affect development costs and timing of the expansion of existing facilities

sempra energys subsidiaries rely on transportation assets and services that they do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas 

sempra energys subsidiaries depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas they sell to wholesale markets to supply natural gas to their electric generation facilities and to provide retail energy services to customers sempra pipelines  storage also depends on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting sempra lng also will rely on specialized lng ships to transport lng to its lng facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate the ability of sempra energys subsidiaries to sell and deliver their products and services may be hindered as a result they may be responsible for damages incurred by their customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at thencurrent spot market rates

sempra energys businesses require numerous permits and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies and any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals could cause sempra energys sales to decline andor its costs to increase 

the acquisition ownership and operation of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and electric generation facilities require numerous permits approvals and certificates from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies all of the existing and planned development projects of sempra energys subsidiaries require multiple permits if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if the company fails to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations it may not be able to operate its facilities or it may be forced to incur additional costs 

sempra energys businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation 

in recent years the regulatory environment applicable to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on both federal and state levels which have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and sempra energy cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on its businesses moreover existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to the company and its facilities future changes in laws and regulations may have a detrimental effect on sempra energys business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

sempra energys other operations are subject to affiliate rules relating to transactions with the sempra utilities and with each other these businesses could be adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional cpuc or ferc rules further restricting their ability to sell electricity or natural gas or to trade with the sempra utilities and with each other affiliate transaction rules also could require these businesses to obtain the prior approval of the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the sempra utilities any such restrictions or approval requirements could adversely affect the lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation plants or trading operations of the companys subsidiaries

various proceedings inquiries and investigations relating to the business activities of sempra generation and sempra commodities are currently pending before the ferc a description of such proceedings inquiries and investigations is provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

sempra energys international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

sempra energy subsidiaries have interests in electricity generation natural gas distribution and transmission and lng terminal projects in mexico and also have trading marketing and risk management operations in canada europe and asia sempra pipelines  storage has ownership interests in electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in argentina chile and peru developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject the company to significant political legal and financial risks which vary by country including

· 

changes in foreign laws and regulations including tax and environmental laws and regulations and us laws and regulations related to foreign operations 

· 

high rates of inflation 

· 

changes in government policies or personnel 

· 

trade restrictions 

· 

limitations on us company ownership in foreign countries 

· 

permitting and regulatory compliance 

· 

changes in labor supply and labor relations in operations outside the us 

· 

adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals challenges to permits difficulty in enforcing contractual rights and unsettled property rights and titles in mexico and other foreign jurisdictions and 

· 

general political economic and business conditions 

sempra energys international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries while sempra pipelines  storage believes that it has contracts and other measures in place to mitigate its most significant foreign currency exchange risks it has some exposure that is not fully mitigated

other risks related to the company 

sempra energys businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could adversely affect sempra energys profitability 

sempra energys subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection including in particular global warming and greenhouse gas ghg emissions they are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses and other approvals to construct and operate their businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements they must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment and emissions fees the company also is generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of its electric generation facilities and other energy projects regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown if sempra energys subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable environmental laws they may be subject to penalties fines andor curtailments of their operations 

the scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations including their effects on current operations and future expansions are difficult to predict increasing international national regional and statelevel concerns as well as new or proposed legislation may have substantial effects on operations operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansion in particular statelevel laws and regulations as well as proposed national and international legislation relating to greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbon perfluorocarbon and sulfur hexafluoride may limit or otherwise adversely affect the operations of sempra energy and its subsidiaries the implementation of recent california legislation and proposed federal legislation may adversely affect sempra energys unregulated businesses by imposing additional costs associated with emission limits and the possible requirement of the purchase of emission credits similarly the sempra utilities may be affected if costs are not recoverable in rates and because the effects of significantly tougher standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth

in addition existing and future laws and regulation on mercury nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees 

and taxes that could adversely affect sempra energys subsidiaries moreover existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may adversely affect the company and its facilities and operations additional information on these matters is provided in note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect sempra energys business earnings and cash flows 

like other major industrial facilities sempra energys generation plants electric transmission facilities lng receipt terminals and storage facilities chartered oil and lng tankers and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities may be damaged by natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism any such incidents could result in severe business disruptions significant decreases in revenues or significant additional costs to the company which could have a material adverse effect on the companys earnings and cash flows given the nature and location of these facilities any such incidents also could cause fires leaks explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties or personal injuries which could lead to significant claims against the company and its subsidiaries insurance coverage may become unavailable for certain of these risks and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or damage to any of its facilities or for any loss of or damage to natural resources or property or personal injuries caused by its operations may be insufficient to cover the companys losses or liabilities without materially adversely affecting the companys financial condition earnings and cash flows

sempra energys cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries 

the companys ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations is dependent on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources cash flows from the subsidiaries are dependent in the long term on the ability of the subsidiaries to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own capital expenditures in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including as a result of legislation or regulation or in times of financial distress 

government regulation 

the most significant government regulation affecting sempra energy is the regulation of its utility subsidiaries

california utility regulation 

the cpuc which consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for staggered sixyear terms regulates sdges and socalgas rates and conditions of service sales of securities rate of return rates of depreciation uniform systems of accounts and longterm resource procurement except as described below under “united states utility regulation” the cpuc also has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric transmission electric distribution and natural gas transmission facilities the cpuc conducts various reviews of utility performance conducts audits of the company’s records for compliance with regulatory guidelines and conducts investigations into various matters such as deregulation competition and the environment to determine its future policies the cpuc also regulates the interactions 

and transactions of the utilities with sempra energy as discussed further in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the california energy commission cec establishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based upon these forecasts the cec determines the need for additional energy sources and for conservation programs the cec sponsors alternativeenergy research and development projects promotes energy conservation programs and maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages in addition the cec certifies powerplant sites and related facilities within california

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of supply availability and prices for every market sector consuming natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is used to support longterm investment decisions

assembly bill 32 the california global warming solutions act of 2006 makes the california air resources board carb responsible for monitoring and reducing ghg emissions the bill requires carb to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real quantifiable and costeffective ghg emission reductions including among other things a statewide ghg emissions cap mandatory reporting rules and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of ghg emissions carb is a part of the california environmental protection agency an organization which reports directly to the governors office in the executive branch of california state government the california legislature established carb in 1967 to attain and maintain healthy air quality and to conduct research into the causes of and solutions to air pollution carb is made up of eleven members appointed by the governor 

united states utility regulation 

the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the uniform systems of accounts rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale both the ferc and the cpuc are currently investigating prices charged to the california investorowned utilities ious by various suppliers of natural gas and electricity further discussion is provided in notes 13 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the nrc oversees the licensing construction and operation of nuclear facilities nrc regulations require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities periodically the nrc requires that newly developed data and techniques be used to reanalyze the design of a nuclear power plant and as a result requires plant modifications as a condition of continued operation in some cases

local regulation 

socalgas has natural gas franchises with the 240 legal jurisdictions in its service territory these franchises allow socalgas to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas in streets and other public places some franchises such as that for the city of los angeles which expires in 2012 have fixed expiration dates ranging from 2007 to 2048 most of the franchises have indeterminate lives with no expiration date 

sdge has electric franchises with the two counties and the 26 cities in its electric service territory and natural gas franchises with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service 

territory these franchises allow sdge to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity andor natural gas in streets and other public places most of the franchises have indeterminate lives except for the electric and natural gas franchises with the cities of encinitas 2012 chula vista 2015 san diego 2020 and coronado 2028 and the natural gas franchises with the county of san diego 2029 and the city of escondido 2035 

sempra pipelines  storage’s mexican utilities build and operate natural gas distribution systems in mexicali chihuahua and the la lagunadurango zone in northcentral mexico and sempra generation operates a natural gasfired power plant in baja california mexico these operations are regulated by labor and environmental agencies of city and state governments sempra generation sempra lng and sempra pipelines  storage have operations in nevada arizona california louisiana maine and north carolina these entities are regulated by the respective states and local utilities commissions in which they operate 

other regulation 

sempra commodities operations are subject to regulation by the new york mercantile exchange the london metal exchange the commodity futures trading commission the ferc and the national futures association it also has trading locations in canada europe and asia that are subject to regulation as to operations and financial position by bodies such as the financial services authority and the london international futures exchange 

sempra generation and sempra lng have operations in the united states that are subject to regulation by the ferc and operations in mexico that are subject to regulation by the comisión reguladora de energía 

sempra pipelines  storages operations in mexico are subject to mexicos federal regulations the primary regulatory body is the comisión reguladora de energía 

licenses and permits 

the sempra utilities obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity they require periodic renewal which results in continuing regulation by the granting agency 

the companys other subsidiaries are also required to obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in the normal course of business some of these permits authorizations and licenses require periodic renewal sempra generation and its subsidiaries obtain a number of permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities and in connection with wholesale distribution of electricity sempra pipelines  storage’s mexican subsidiaries obtain construction permits for their natural gas distribution and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided sempra pipelines  storage obtains licenses and permits for natural gas storage facilities and pipelines sempra lng obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of lng facilities 

other regulatory matters are described in notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

california natural gas utility operations 

the company is engaged in the purchase sale distribution storage and transportation of natural gas through the sempra utilities the companys resource planning natural gas procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters are discussed below and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

customers 

for regulatory purposes customers are classified as core and noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers without alternative fuel capability noncore customers consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from the sempra utilities core customers are permitted to aggregate their natural gas requirement and purchase directly from brokers or producers the sempra utilities continue to be obligated to purchase reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of core customers

natural gas procurement and transportation 

most of the natural gas purchased and delivered by the sempra utilities is produced outside of california primarily in the southwestern us us rockies and canada the sempra utilities purchase natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts which are primarily based on monthly spotmarket prices

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to the distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas is committed to firm pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation entitlements socalgas sells any excess capacity on a shortterm basis interstate pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company and kern river gas transmission provide transportation services into socalgas intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services are regulated by the ferc 

sdge has natural gas transportation contracts with various interstate pipelines that expire on various dates between 2007 and 2023 sdge currently purchases natural gas on a spot basis from canada the us rockies and the southwestern us to fill its longterm pipeline capacity and purchases additional spotmarket supplies delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements sdge continues its ongoing assessment of its pipeline capacity portfolio including the release of a portion of this capacity to third parties in accordance with regulatory directives sdge continues to reconfigure its pipeline capacity portfolio to secure firm transportation rights from a diverse mix of us and canadian supply sources for its projected core customer natural gas requirements all of sdges natural gas is delivered through socalgas pipelines under a longterm transportation agreement in addition under separate agreements expiring in march 2008 socalgas provides sdge up to nine billion cubic feet bcf of storage capacity 

according to btus daily gas wire the average spot price of natural gas at the californiaarizona border was 615 per million british thermal units mmbtu in 2006 674 per mmbtu in december 2006 compared with 762 per mmbtu in 2005 and 557 per mmbtu in 2004 the sempra utilities weighted average cost including transportation charges per mmbtu of natural gas was 654 in 2006 783 in 2005 and 594 in 2004 

natural gas storage 

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for use by core noncore and offsystem customers core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas storage capacity other customers including sdge can bid and negotiate the desired amount of storage on a contract basis the storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to store natural gas usually during the summer to reduce winter purchases when natural gas costs are generally higher this allows customers to select the level of service they desire to assist them in managing their fuel procurement and transportation needs 

demand for natural gas 

the sempra utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on the customers preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products in the noncore industrial market some customers are capable of using alternate fuels which can affect the demand for natural gas the companys ability to maintain its industrial market share is largely dependent on energy prices the demand for natural gas by electric generators is influenced by a number of factors in the shortterm natural gas use by electric generators is impacted by the availability of alternative sources of generation the availability of hydroelectricity is highly dependent on precipitation in the western united states and canada in addition natural gas use is impacted by the performance of other generation sources in the western united states including nuclear and coal and other natural gas facilities outside the service area natural gas use is also impacted by changes in enduse electricity demand for example natural gas use generally increases during summer heat waves over the longterm natural gas used to generate electricity will be influenced by additional factors such as the location of new power plant construction and the development of renewable resources more generation capacity currently is being constructed outside southern california than within the sempra utilities service area this new generation will likely displace the output of older lessefficient local generation reducing the use of natural gas for local electric generation

effective march 31 1998 electric industry restructuring provided outofstate producers the option to provide power to california utility customers as a result natural gas demand for electric generation within southern california competes with electric power generated throughout the western united states although electric industry restructuring has no direct impact on the companys natural gas operations future volumes of natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be significantly affected to the extent that regulatory changes divert electric generation from the companys service area

growth in the natural gas markets is largely dependent upon the health and expansion of the southern california economy and prices of other energy products external factors such as weather the price of electricity electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable resources development of new natural gas supply sources and general economic conditions can result in significant shifts in demand and market price the sempra utilities added 85000 and 86000 new customer meters in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

representing growth rates of 13 percent and 14 percent respectively the sempra utilities expect that their growth rate for 2007 will approximate that of 2006 

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal in nature and revenues generally are greater during the winter months as is prevalent in the industry the company injects natural gas into storage during the summer months usually april through october for withdrawal from storage during the winter months usually november through march when customer demand is higher

electric utility operations 

customers 

at december 31 2006 sdge had 14 million customer meters consisting of 1202000 residential 144000 commercial 500 industrial 2000 street and highway lighting and 5800 direct access the companys service area covers 4100 square miles the company added 17000 new electric customer meters in 2006 and 20000 in 2005 representing growth rates of 13 percent and 15 percent respectively the company expects that its growth rate for 2007 will approximate that of 2006

resource planning and power procurement 

sdges resource planning power procurement and related regulatory matters are discussed in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 13 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

electric resources

 effective january 1 2007 after 1206 mw were reallocated to southern california edison edison by the cpuc as described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

under the contract with pge sdge pays a capacity charge plus a charge based on the amount of energy received andor pges nonfuel costs costs under the contracts with qfs are based on sdges avoided cost charges under the remaining contracts are for firm and asavailable energy and are based on the amount of energy received the prices under these contracts are at the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated

songs 

sdge owns 20 percent of songs which is located south of san clemente california songs consists of three nuclear generating units the city of riverside owns 179 percent of units 2 and 3 and edison the operator of songs owns the remaining interests the city of anaheim sold its 316 percent interest in songs units 2 and 3 to edison effective december 28 2006

unit 1 was removed from service in november 1992 when the cpuc issued a decision to permanently shut it down decommissioning of unit 1 is now in progress and its spent nuclear fuel is being stored on site

units 2 and 3 began commercial operation in august 1983 and april 1984 respectively sdges share of the capacity is 214 mw of unit 2 and 216 mw of unit 3

sdge has fully recovered its songs capital investment through december 31 2003 and earns a return only on subsequent additions including the companys share of costs associated with planned steam generator replacements

additional information concerning the songs units and nuclear decommissioning is provided below in environmental matters herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 6 13 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

nuclear fuel supply 

the nuclear fuel supply cycle includes materials and services uranium oxide conversion of uranium oxide to uranium hexafluoride uranium enrichment services and fabrication of fuel assemblies performed by others under various contracts which extend through 2012 the availability and the cost of the various components of the nuclear fuel cycle for sdges 20percent ownership interest in songs in subsequent years cannot be estimated at this time

spent fuel from songs is being stored on site in the independent spent fuel storage installation where storage capacity is expected to be adequate through 2022 the expiration date of the units nrc operating license pursuant to the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 sdge entered into a contract with the us department of energy doe for spentfuel disposal under the agreement the doe is responsible for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel from songs sdge pays the doe a disposal fee of 100 per megawatthour of net nuclear generation or 3 million per year the doe projects that it will not begin accepting spent fuel until 2010 at the earliest

additional information concerning nuclearfuel costs and the storage and movement of spent fuel is provided in notes 13 and 15 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

power pools 

sdge is a participant in the western systems power pool which includes an electricpower and transmissionrate agreement with utilities and power agencies located throughout the united states and canada more than 270 investorowned and municipal utilities state and federal power agencies energy brokers and power marketers share power and information in order to increase efficiency and competition in the bulk power market participants are able to make power transactions on standardized terms that have been preapproved by the ferc 

transmission arrangements 

the pacific intertie consisting of ac and dc transmission lines connects the northwest us with sdge pacific gas  electric edison and others under an agreement sdges share of the pacific intertie is 266 mw 

power originating from sources utilizing the pacific intertie as well as power from other sources can be imported into sdges system via the edison  sdge interconnection at the songs switchyard five 230kilovolt transmission lines into sdges system from that interconnection comprise the south of songs path which is normally rated at 2200 mw

subject to the fercs approval and any litigation concerning term the pacific intertie agreement will expire no earlier than july 31 2007 sdge is currently evaluating its participation in the agreement and has not yet determined whether or not to propose an extension of the agreement

sdges 500kilovolt southwest powerlink transmission line which is shared with arizona public service company and imperial irrigation district extends from palo verde arizona to san diego sdges share of the line is 1163 mw although it can be less under certain system conditions 

mexicos baja california norte system is connected to sdges system via two 230kilovolt interconnections with firm capability of 408 mw in the north to south direction and 800 mw in the south to north direction 

sdge is in the planning stages for the sunrise powerlink a new 500kilovolt transmission line between the existing imperial valley substation and a new central substation to be located within the sdge system the proposed rating of the sunrise powerlink is 1000 mw or higher the project is subject to cpuc approval and is estimated to cost 13 billion of which sdges participation is expected to be 1 billion the project subject to timely regulatory approval and permitting is planned to be in service in 2010

transmission access 

the national energy policy act governs procedures for others requests for transmission service the ferc approved the california ious transfer of operation and control of their transmission facilities to the independent system operator iso in 1998 

additional information regarding the ferc iso and transmission issues is provided in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

sempra global 

sempra global consists of most of the businesses of sempra energy other than the sempra utilities and serves a broad range of customers energy and other needs sempra global includes sempra commodities sempra generation sempra lng and sempra pipelines  storage descriptions of these business units and information concerning their operations are provided under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 2 3 4 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

rates and regulation  sempra utilities 

information concerning rates and regulation applicable to the sempra utilities is provided in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

discussions about environmental issues affecting the company are included in notes 13 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following additional information should be read in conjunction with those discussions

hazardous substances 

in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative memorandum account allowing californias ious to recover their hazardous waste cleanup costs including those related to superfund sites or similar sites requiring cleanup rate recovery of 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses is permitted in addition the company has the opportunity to retain a percentage of any insurance recoveries to offset the 10 percent of costs not recovered in rates

at december 31 2006 the company had accrued its estimated remaining investigation and remediation liability related to hazardous waste sites including numerous locations that had been manufacturedgas plants of 393 million of which 90 percent is authorized to be recovered through the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism this estimated cost excludes remediation costs of 89 million associated with sdges former fossilfuel power plants the company believes that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position

estimated liabilities for environmental remediation are recorded when amounts are probable and estimable amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism are recorded as a regulatory asset

electric and magnetic fields emfs 

although scientists continue to research the possibility that exposure to emfs causes adverse health effects science has not demonstrated a causeandeffect relationship between exposure to the type of emfs emitted by power lines and other electrical facilities and adverse health effects some laboratory studies suggest that such exposure creates biological effects but those effects have not been shown to be harmful the studies that have most concerned the public are epidemiological studies some of which have reported a weak correlation between childhood leukemia and the proximity of homes to certain power lines and equipment other epidemiological studies found no correlation between estimated exposure and any disease scientists cannot explain why some studies using estimates of past exposure report correlations between estimated emf levels and disease while others do not

to respond to public concerns the cpuc previously directed california ious to adopt a lowcost emfreduction policy that requires reasonable design changes to achieve noticeable reduction of emf levels that are anticipated from new projects in 2006 the cpuc reviewed the resultant policy 

in an order instituting ratemaking and found no new scientific research to support a change to the existing policy finding existing policy of prudent avoidance to be sufficient and reasonable

air and water quality 

the transmission and distribution of natural gas require the operation of compressor stations which are subject to increasingly stringent airquality standards costs to comply with these standards are recovered in rates

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other owners of songs previously reached an agreement with the california coastal commission to mitigate the environmental damage to the marine environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs units 2 and 3 sdges share of the cost is estimated to be 35 million of which 18 million had been incurred at december 31 2006 and 17 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050 in may 2006 the cpuc adopted a decision in edisons 2006 general rate case in which decision sdge is no longer subject to a 50percent disallowance of cost recovery going forward

the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report should be considered carefully when evaluating sempra energy and its subsidiaries these risk factors could affect the actual results of sempra energy and its subsidiaries and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements of or made by or on behalf of sempra energy or its subsidiaries other risks and uncertainties in addition to those that are described below may also impair their business operations if any of the following risks occurs sempra energys business cash flows results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed in addition the trading price of its securities could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning sempra energy and its subsidiaries set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2005 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference in this report

risks related to the california utilities

the california utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state federal and local legislation and regulatory authorities which may adversely affect the operations performance and growth of their businesses

the california public utilities commission cpuc which consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for staggered sixyear terms regulates the california utilities rates except electric transmission rates which are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and conditions of service sales of securities rates of return rates of depreciation uniform systems of accounts examination of records and longterm resource procurement the cpuc conducts various reviews of utility performance which may include reasonableness and prudency reviews and affiliate relationships and conducts audits and investigations into various matters which may from time to time result in disallowances and penalties adversely affecting earnings and cash flows various proceedings involving the cpuc and relating to the california utilities rates costs incentive mechanisms performancebased regulation and compliance with affiliate and holding company rules are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

periodically the california utilities rates are approved by the cpuc based on forecasts of capital and operating costs if the california utilities actual capital and operating costs were to exceed the amount included in its base rates approved by the cpuc it would adversely affect earnings and cash flows

to promote efficient operations and improved productivity and to move away from reasonableness reviews and disallowances the cpuc adopted performancebased regulation pbr for the california utilities under pbr regulators require future income potential to be tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating income goals rather than relying solely on expanding utility plant to increase earnings the three areas that are eligible for pbr rewards are operational incentives based on measurements of safety reliability and customer satisfaction energy efficiency rewards based on the effectiveness of the programs and natural gas procurement rewards although the california utilities have received pbr rewards in the past there can be no assurance that they will receive rewards in the future or that they would be of comparable amounts additionally if the california utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under the pbr mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances or penalties which could negatively affect earnings and cash flows

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access and other similar matters involving sdge 

the california utilities may be adversely affected by new regulations decisions orders or interpretations of the cpuc ferc or other regulatory bodies new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could change how the california utilities operate could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms or could require the california utilities to incur additional expenses

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its ownership of nuclear facilities

sdge owns a 20 interest in the san onofre nuclear generating station songs a 2150 megawatt nuclear generating facility near san clemente california the nuclear regulatory commission nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities sdges ownership interest in songs subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation which include

the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives the california utilities future results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against them

the california energy crisis of 2000  2001 has generated numerous lawsuits governmental investigations and regulatory proceedings involving many energy companies including sempra energy and the california utilities in january 2006 sempra energy and the california utilities reached agreement to settle several of these lawsuits including subject to court and other approvals the principal class action antitrust lawsuits in which they are defendants the companies remain defendants in several additional lawsuits arising out of the energy crisis including lawsuits commenced in the fourth quarter of 2005 by the california attorney general the company is also responding to an ongoing cpuc proceeding related to the increase in natural gas prices at the californiaarizona border in 2000  2001 sempra energy and the california utilities have expended and continue to expend substantial amounts defending these lawsuits and in connection with related investigations and regulatory proceedings sempra energy and the california utilities have established reserves for the agreed and unresolved issues however given the uncertainties involved in resolving litigation sempra energys and the california utilities results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

these proceedings are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

risks related to sempra energys electric generation commodities trading liquefied natural gas lng pipelines  storage and other businesses

sempra energys businesses are exposed to market risk and its financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity market prices that are beyond its control

sempra commodities is a fullservice trading company that markets and trades physical and financial commodity products its trading portfolios consist of physical and financial commodity contracts including contracts for natural gas electricity petroleum products base metals and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash although sempra commodities generally seeks to structure its trading contracts so that a substantial majority of its trading revenues are realizable within 24 months and strives to maintain appropriate hedging mechanisms for its trading book sempra commodities may have substantial unhedged trading positions in the market resulting from the management of its trading portfolios or from its inability to hedge in whole or in part particular risks 

sempra generation generates electricity that it sells under longterm contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets it purchases fuel for its power plants consisting of natural gas and coal and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy its contractual obligations 

sempra energys revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas coal or other commodities whether procured for power plants or to satisfy contractual obligations with trading counterparties or customers in regional markets and other competitive markets in which the company competes change in a direction or manner that it has not anticipated and for which it has not provided through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated and other commodities result from multiple factors including weather conditions seasonality changes in demand transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources commodity production levels actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries with respect to the supply of crude oil federal state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation natural disasters wars embargoes and other catastrophic events and expropriation of assets by foreign countries 

in 2001 the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which the company operates imposed price limitations which resulted in unexpected moves in electricity prices the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time in the future any such action by the ferc may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and may have an adverse effect on sempra energys sales and results of operations 

sempra energy and its subsidiaries cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge their assets or positions against changes in commodity prices and their hedging procedures may not work as planned

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations sempra energys subsidiaries routinely enter into contracts to hedge a substantial portion of their purchase and sale commitments and inventories of electricity natural gas coal crude oil and refined petroleum products base metals and other commodities as part of this strategy they routinely utilize fixedprice forward physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges however the company does not cover the entire exposure of its assets or its positions to market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time to the extent sempra energys subsidiaries have unhedged positions or if their hedging strategies do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

risk management procedures may not prevent losses

although sempra energy and its subsidiaries have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses risk management procedures may not always be followed or may not always work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are based on historic price movements if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect the company from significant losses as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurances that sempra energys risk management procedures will prevent losses that would negatively affect its business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

a downgrade in sempra energys credit ratings could negatively affect its commodities trading and other nonutility businesses

if sempra energys credit ratings were to be downgraded the business prospects of its commodities trading and other nonutility businesses which generally rely on the creditworthiness of sempra energy would be adversely affected sempra commodities would be required to comply with various margin or other credit enhancement obligations under its trading and marketing contracts substantially all of which are guaranteed by sempra energy and it may be unable to continue to trade or able to do so only on lessfavorable terms to meet liquidity requirements sempra energy and its subsidiaries maintain substantial unused committed lines of credit for which borrowings are available without regard to credit ratings however a ratings downgrade could require sempra energy to divert to sempra commodities all or a portion of the liquidity that these lines would otherwise provide for the expansion of sempra energys other nonutility businesses in addition if these lines were to become unavailable or to be inadequate to meet margin or other credit enhancement requirements sempra commodities trading partners could exercise other remedies such as liquidating and netting their exposures to sempra commodities making it more difficult or impossible for sempra commodities to manage effectively its remaining trading positions or to continue its trading business and sempra energy and its subsidiaries may not have sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations

sempra energys businesses depend on counterparties customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements and any failure by them to perform could require the company to incur substantial expenses and expose it to commodity price risk and volatility which could adversely affect sempra energys liquidity cash flows and results of operations

sempra energys subsidiaries are exposed to the risk that counterparties customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other longterm agreements will not perform their obligations under such agreements should they fail to perform the company may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such event sempra energys subsidiaries may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in addition the subsidiaries often extend credit to counterparties and customers while the company performs significant credit analyses prior to extending credit sempra energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to the risk that they may not be able to collect amounts owed to them 

if the department of water resources dwr were to succeed in setting aside or were to fail to perform its obligations under its longterm power contract with sempra generation sempra energys business results of operations and cash flows will be materially adversely affected

in 2001 sempra generation entered into a 10year power sales agreement with the dwr to supply up to 1900 megawatts to the state sempra energy expects the contract with the dwr will be a source of significant revenue over the 10year period the validity of the power sales agreement with the dwr continues to be the subject of extensive litigation between the parties before the ferc in california courts and in arbitration proceedings if the dwr were to succeed in setting aside its obligations under the contract or if the dwr fails or is unable to meet its contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys business results of operations cash flows and financial condition these proceedings are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as described in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the company unilaterally reduced its price to the dwr by 415 per megawatthour in connection with the agreement to settle other litigation

in the future sempra energys subsidiaries may elect not to or may not be able to enter into longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm firm capacity agreements for their projects which would subject their sales to increased volatility and its businesses to increased competition

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries have become highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures increase wholesale electricity prices become more volatile without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements such as the 10year power sales agreement between sempra generation and the dwr sempra energys sales will be subject to increased price volatility and it may be unable to sell the power generated by sempra generations facilities or operate those facilities profitably 

sempra lng has obtained longterm lng supply agreements that substantially reduce its exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying supply prices to prevailing natural gas prices or longterm firm capacity agreements for a substantial portion of the processing capacity of the lng terminals that it currently has under construction and does not intend to commence significant construction of other lng terminals until it has obtained similar longterm agreements however if the counterparties customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a significant negative impact on sempra energys business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled which could increase sempra energys costs and impair its ability to recover its investments

the acquisition development and construction of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks sempra energy and its subsidiaries may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built sempra energys success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things negotiation of satisfactory engineering procurement and construction agreements supply and natural gas sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements receipt of required governmental permits and timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction and successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by unforeseen engineering problems construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls work stoppages adverse weather conditions environmental and geological conditions and other factors if the company is unable to complete the development of a facility it typically will not be able to recover its investment in the project 

the operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks including the breakdown or failure of generation or regasification and storage facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel interruption and operating performance below expected levels in addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification storage and transmission systems the occurrence of any of these events could lead to operating facilities below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties and could adversely affect sempra energys business cash flows and results of operations

competition among developers and operators of lng terminals is rapidly increasing which may adversely affect the profitability of sempra lngs proposed lng terminals 

although there are only a limited number of lng terminal facilities operating in north america today many companies have announced plans to develop lng facilities to serve the north american market some of these competitors have more operating experience more development experience larger staffs and greater financial resources than the company industry analysts have predicted that if all of the proposed lng facilities in north america that have been announced by developers are actually built there will likely be substantial excess capacity for such terminals in the near future excess capacity would likely lead to decreased prices for such services although its lng facilities in mexico louisiana and texas are more advanced in the siting permitting and regulatory approval processes than the proposed projects of many of its competitors there can be no assurance that sempra energy will be able to maintain that advantage 

sempra energys subsidiaries rely on transportation assets that they do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas

sempra energys subsidiaries depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas they sell to wholesale markets to supply natural gas and coal to their electric generation facilities and to provide retail energy services to customers sempra lng also will rely on specialized lng ships to transport lng to its lng facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate the ability of sempra energys subsidiaries to sell and deliver their products and services may be hindered as a result they may be responsible for damages incurred by their customers such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at thencurrent spot market rates

sempra energys businesses require numerous permits and other governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies and any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals could cause sempra energys sales to decline andor its costs to increase

the acquisition ownership and operation of lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and electric generation facilities require numerous permits approvals and certificates from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies all of the existing and planned development projects of sempra energys subsidiaries require multiple permits if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if the company fails to obtain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations it may not be able to operate its facilities or it may be forced to incur additional costs 

sempra energys businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation

in recent years the regulatory environment applicable to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on both federal and state levels which have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses these changes are ongoing and sempra energy cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on its businesses moreover existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to the company and its facilities future changes in laws and regulations may have a detrimental effect on sempra energys business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

sempra energys other operations are subject to affiliate rules relating to transactions with the california utilities these businesses could be adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional cpuc or ferc rules further restricting their ability to sell electricity or natural gas or to trade with the california utilities affiliate transaction rules also could require these businesses to obtain the prior approval of the cpuc before entering into any such transactions with the california utilities any such restrictions or approval requirements could adversely affect the lng receiving terminals natural gas pipelines electric generation plants or trading operations of the companys subsidiaries

various proceedings inquiries and investigations relating to the business activities of sempra generation and sempra commodities are currently pending before the ferc a description of such proceedings inquiries and investigations is provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

sempra energys businesses have significant environmental compliance costs and future environmental compliance costs could adversely affect sempra energys profitability

sempra energys subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to environmental protection they are required to obtain numerous governmental permits licenses and other approvals to construct and operate their businesses additionally to comply with these legal requirements they must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring pollution control equipment and emissions fees the company also is generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with the environmental condition of its electric generation facilities and other energy projects which it has acquired or developed regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown if sempra energys subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable environmental laws they may be subject to penalties fines andor curtailments of their operations 

the scope and effect of any new environmental laws and regulations including their effects on operations are difficult to predict however increasing national and international concerns regarding global warming and proposed regulations regarding carbon dioxide mercury nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or significant emission fees or taxes that could adversely affect sempra generation in addition existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and other new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to the company and its facilities 

sempra energys international businesses are exposed to different local regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys financial condition cash flows and results of operations

sempra energy subsidiaries currently have interests in electricity generation natural gas distribution and transmission and lng terminal projects in mexico and also have trading marketing and risk management operations in canada europe and asia sempra pipelines  storage also has ownership interests in electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in argentina chile and peru developing infrastructure projects owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject the company to significant political and financial risks which vary by country including

changes in foreign laws and regulations including tax and environmental laws and regulations changes in us laws and regulations including tax and environmental laws and regulations related to foreign operations high rates of inflation changes in government policies or personnel trade restrictions limitations on us company ownership in foreign countries permitting and regulatory compliance changes in labor supply and labor relations in operations outside the us adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals and difficulty in enforcing contractual rights in foreign jurisdictions and general political economic and business conditions sempra energys international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries for example the devaluation of the argentine peso against the us dollar in recent years as well as the argentine governments unilateral retroactive abrogation of utility agreements in early 2002 has had a material adverse effect on sempra pipelines  storages two unconsolidated subsidiaries in argentina in september 2002 sempra pipelines  storage initiated arbitration proceedings under the 1994 bilateral investment treaty between the us and argentina for recovery of the diminution of the value of its investments that has resulted from argentine governmental actions sempra pipelines  storage has claimed damages of at least 211 million revised from an earlier claim of 258 million in these proceedings which are continuing a description of legal proceedings relating to sempra pipelines  storages business operations in argentina is provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements while sempra pipelines  storage believes that it has contracts and other measures in place to mitigate its most significant foreign currency exchange risks it has some exposure that is not fully mitigated

other risks related to the company

sempra energys cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries

the companys ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations is dependent on cash flows from its subsidiaries and in the short term its ability to raise capital from external sources cash flows from the subsidiaries are dependent in the long term on the ability of the subsidiaries to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own capital expenditures in addition the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances including as a result of legislation or regulation or in times of financial distress 

natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect sempra energys business earnings and cash flows

like other major industrial facilities sempra energys generation plants including songs electric transmission facilities lng receiving terminals and storage facilities chartered oil and lng tankers and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities may be damaged by natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism any such incidents could result in severe business disruptions significant decreases in revenues or significant additional costs to the company which could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys earnings and cash flows given the nature and location of these facilities any such incidents also could cause fires leaks explosions spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties or personal injuries which could lead to significant claims against sempra energy and its subsidiaries insurance coverage may become unavailable for certain of these risks and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or damage to any of its facilities or for any loss of or damage to natural resources or property or personal injuries caused by its operations may be insufficient to cover the companys losses or liabilities without materially adversely affecting the companys financial condition earnings and cash flows

government regulation

the most significant government regulation affecting sempra energy is the regulation over its utility subsidiaries

california utility regulation

the cpuc which consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for staggered sixyear terms regulates sdges and socalgas rates and conditions of service sales of securities rate of return rates of depreciation uniform systems of accounts examination of records and longterm resource procurement the cpuc conducts various reviews of utility performance and conducts investigations into various matters such as deregulation competition and the environment to determine its future policies the cpuc also regulates the relationship of the california utilities with sempra energy and is currently investigating this relationship as discussed further in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the california energy commission cec has discretion over electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories based upon these forecasts the cec determines the need for additional energy sources and for conservation programs the cec sponsors alternativeenergy research and development projects promotes energy conservation programs and maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages in addition the cec certifies powerplant sites and related facilities within california

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of supply availability and prices for every market sector consuming natural gas in california this forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this analysis is used to support longterm investment decisions

united states utility regulation

the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission access the uniform systems of accounts rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale both the ferc and the cpuc are currently investigating prices charged to the california investorowned utilities ious by various suppliers of natural gas and electricity further discussion is provided in notes 13 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the nrc oversees the licensing construction and operation of nuclear facilities nrc regulations require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities periodically the nrc requires that newly developed data and techniques be used to reanalyze the design of a nuclear power plant and as a result requires plant modifications as a condition of continued operation in some cases

local regulation

socalgas has natural gas franchises with the 240 legal jurisdictions in its service territory these franchises allow socalgas to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas in streets and other public places some franchises have fixed lives such as that for the city of los angeles which expires in 2012 the range of expiration dates for the franchises with definite lives is 2006 to 2048 most of the franchises have indeterminate lives with no termination date

sdge has electric franchises with the two counties and the 26 cities in its electric service territory and natural gas franchises with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory these franchises allow sdge to locate operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity andor natural gas in streets and other public places most of the franchises have indeterminate lives except for the electric and natural gas franchises with the cities of encinitas 2012 san diego 2020 coronado 2028 and chula vista 2035 and the natural gas franchises with the city of escondido 2035 and the county of san diego 2029

sempra pipelines  storages mexican utilities build and operate natural gas distribution systems in mexicali chihuahua and the la lagunadurango zone in northcentral mexico the operations are regulated by labor and environmental agencies of city and state governments and by mexicos comision reguladora de energía 

operations of sempra generation sempra lng and sempra pipelines  storage are regulated by various states and local public utilities commissions and other agencies

other regulation

sempra commodities operations are subject to regulation by the new york mercantile exchange the london metals exchange the commodity futures trading commission the ferc and the national futures association it also has trading locations in canada europe and asia that are subject to regulation as to operations and financial position

sempra generation and sempra lng have operations in the united states that are subject to regulation by the ferc and operations in mexico that are subject to regulation by the comision reguladora de energía 

sempra pipelines  storages affiliates have international operations in argentina chile mexico and peru that are subject to federal local and other regulations of the countries andor political subdivisions in which they are located these regulatory bodies include but are not limited to mexicos comision reguladora de energia argentinas ente nacional regulador de gas chiles comision nacional de energia and perus consejo nacional de energia 

other subsidiaries are also subject to varying amounts of regulation by various governments including various states in the united states

licenses and permits

the california utilities obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity they require periodic renewal which results in continuing regulation by the granting agency 

the companys other subsidiaries are also required to obtain numerous permits authorizations and licenses in the normal course of business some of these permits authorizations and licenses require periodic renewal sempra generation and its subsidiaries obtain a number of permits authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities in addition sempra generation obtains permits in connection with wholesale distribution of electricity sempra pipelines  storages mexican subsidiaries obtain construction permits for their natural gas distribution and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided sempra pipelines  storage obtains licenses and permits for natural gas storage facilities and pipelines sempra lng obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of lng facilities 

other regulatory matters are described in notes 13 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

natural gas utility operations

resource planning and natural gas procurement and transportation

the company is engaged in the purchase sale distribution storage and transportation of natural gas through the california utilities the companys resource planning power procurement contractual commitments and related regulatory matters are discussed below and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

customers

for regulatory purposes customers are separated into core and noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers without alternative fuel capability noncore customers consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large commercial industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers 

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from the california utilities core customers are permitted to aggregate their natural gas requirement and purchase directly from brokers or producers the california utilities continue to be obligated to purchase reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of core customers

natural gas procurement and transportation 

most of the natural gas purchased and delivered by the california utilities is produced outside of california primarily in the southwestern us and canada the california utilities purchase natural gas under shortterm and longterm contracts which are primarily based on monthly spotmarket prices

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to the distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas is committed to firm pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation entitlements socalgas sells excess capacity if any on a shortterm basis interstate pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company transwestern pipeline company and kern river gas transmission provide transportation services into socalgas intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california during 2005 socalgas renegotiated certain expiring capacity contracts with new expiration dates of up to 2011 the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services are regulated by the ferc 

sdge has longterm natural gas transportation contracts with various interstate pipelines that expire on various dates between 2006 and 2023 sdge currently purchases natural gas on a spot basis from canada the rocky mountain area and the southwestern us to fill its longterm pipeline capacity and purchases additional spotmarket supplies delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements sdge continues its ongoing assessment of its pipeline capacity portfolio including the release of a portion of this capacity to third parties in accordance with regulatory directives sdge has reconfigured its pipeline capacity portfolio as of november 2005 to secure firm transportation rights from a diverse mix of us and canadian supply sources for its projected core customer natural gas requirements all of sdges natural gas is delivered through socalgas pipelines under a longterm transportation agreement in addition under separate agreements expiring in march 2008 socalgas provides sdge up to nine billion cubic feet of storage capacity 

according to btus daily gas wire the annual average spot price of natural gas at the californiaarizona border was 762 per million british thermal unit mmbtu in 2005 1142 per mmbtu in december 2005 compared with 557 per mmbtu in 2004 and 513 per mmbtu in 2003 the california utilities weighted average cost including transportation charges per mmbtu of natural gas was 783 in 2005 594 in 2004 and 506 in 2003 

natural gas storage

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for use by the core noncore and offsystem customers core customers are allocated a portion of socalgas storage capacity remaining customers including sdge can bid and negotiate the desired amount of storage on a contract basis the storage service program provides opportunities for customers to store natural gas usually during the summer to reduce winter purchases when natural gas costs are generally higher this allows customers to select the level of service they desire to assist them in managing their fuel procurement and transportation needs 

demand for natural gas

the california utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on the customers preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products in the noncore industrial market some customers are capable of using alternate fuels which can affect the demand for natural gas the companys ability to maintain its industrial market share is largely dependent on energy prices the demand for natural gas by electric generators is influenced by a number of factors in the shortterm natural gas use by electric generators is impacted by the availability of alternative sources of generation the availability of hydroelectricity is highly dependent on precipitation in the western united states in addition natural gas use is impacted by the performance of other generation sources in the western united states including nuclear and coal and other natural gas facilities outside the service area natural gas use is also impacted by changes in enduse electricity demand for example natural gas use generally increases during summer heat waves over the longterm natural gas used to generate electricity will be influenced by additional factors such as the location of new power plant construction and the development of renewable resources more generation capacity currently is being constructed outside southern california than within the california utilities service area this new generation will likely displace the output of older less efficient local generation reducing the use of natural gas for local electric generation

effective march 31 1998 electric industry restructuring provided outofstate producers the option to provide power to california utility customers as a result natural gas demand for electric generation within southern california competes with electric power generated throughout the western united states although electric industry restructuring has no direct impact on the companys natural gas operations future volumes of natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be significantly affected to the extent that regulatory changes divert electric generation from the companys service area

growth in the natural gas markets is largely dependent upon the health and expansion of the southern california economy and prices of other energy products external factors such as weather the price of electricity electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power development of renewable resources development of new natural gas supply sources and general economic conditions can result in significant shifts in demand and market price the california utilities added 86000 new customer meters in each of 2005 and 2004 representing growth rates of 14 percent in both years the california utilities expect that their growth rate for 2006 will approximate 2005s

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal in nature and revenues generally are greater during the winter months as is prevalent in the industry the company injects natural gas into storage during the summer months usually april through october for withdrawal from storage during the winter months usually november through march when customer demand is higher

electric utility operations

customers

at december 31 2005 sdge had 13 million meters consisting of 1188000 residential 141000 commercial 480 industrial 1990 street and highway lighting and 6700 direct access the companys service area covers 4100 square miles the company added 20000 new customer meters in 2005 and 22000 in 2004 representing growth rates of 15 and 17 respectively

units 2 and 3 began commercial operation in august 1983 and april 1984 respectively sdges share of the capacity is 214 mw of unit 2 and 216 mw of unit 3

sdge had fully recovered its songs capital investment through december 31 2003

additional information concerning the songs units and nuclear decommissioning is provided below in environmental matters herein and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 6 13 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

nuclear fuel supply

the nuclear fuel supply cycle includes materials and services uranium oxide conversion of uranium oxide to uranium hexafluoride uranium enrichment services and fabrication of fuel assemblies performed by others under various contracts which extend through 2008 the availability and the cost of the various components of the nuclearfuel cycle for sdges nuclear facilities in subsequent years cannot be estimated at this time

spent fuel from songs is being stored on site in the independent spent fuel storage installation where storage capacity is expected to be adequate through 2022 the expiration date of the units nrc operating license pursuant to the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 sdge entered into a contract with the us department of energy doe for spentfuel disposal under the agreement the doe is responsible for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel from songs sdge pays the doe a disposal fee of 100 per megawatthour of net nuclear generation or 3 million per year the doe projects that it will not begin accepting spent fuel until 2010 at the earliest

additional information concerning nuclearfuel costs and the storage and movement of spent fuel is provided in notes 13 and 15 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

power pools

sdge is a participant in the western systems power pool which includes an electricpower and transmissionrate agreement with utilities and power agencies located throughout the united states and canada more than 270 investorowned and municipal utilities state and federal power agencies energy brokers and power marketers share power and information in order to increase efficiency and competition in the bulk power market participants are able to make power transactions on standardized terms that have been preapproved by the ferc 

transmission arrangements 

the pacific intertie consisting of ac and dc transmission lines connects the northwest with sdge pacific gas  electric pge edison and others under an agreement that expires in july 2007 sdges share of the pacific intertie is 266 mw 

power originating from sources utilizing the pacific intertie as well as power from other sources can be imported into sdges system via the edisonsdge interconnection at the songs switchyard five 230kilovolt transmission lines into sdges system from that interconnection comprise the south of songs path which is normally rated at 2200 mw

sdges 500kilovolt southwest powerlink transmission line which is shared with arizona public service company and imperial irrigation district extends from palo verde arizona to san diego sdges share of the line is 970 mw although it can be less under certain system conditions 

mexicos baja california norte system is connected to sdges system via two 230kilovolt interconnections with firm capability of 408 mw in the north to south direction and 800 mw in the south to north direction 

sdge is in the planning stages for the sunrise powerlink a new 500kilovolt transmission line between the existing imperial valley substation and a new central substation to be located within the sdge system the proposed rating of the sunrise powerlink is 1000 mw or higher the project is subject to cpuc approval and is estimated to cost at least 1 billion the planned inservice date is june 2010

transmission access 

the national energy policy act governs procedures for others requests for transmission service the ferc approved the california ious transfer of operation and control of their transmission facilities to the independent system operator iso in 1998 additional information regarding the ferc iso and transmission issues is provided in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

environmental matters

discussions about environmental issues affecting the company are included in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following additional information should be read in conjunction with those discussions

hazardous substances 

in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative memorandum account allowing californias ious to recover their hazardous waste cleanup costs including those related to superfund sites or similar sites requiring cleanup recovery of 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurancelitigation expenses is permitted in addition the company has the opportunity to retain a percentage of any insurance recoveries to offset the 10 percent of costs not recovered in rates

at december 31 2005 the company had accrued its estimated remaining investigation and remediation liability related to hazardous waste sites including numerous locations that had been manufacturedgas plants of 46 million of which 90 percent is authorized to be recovered through the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism this estimated cost excludes remediation costs of 103 million associated with sdges former fossilfuel power plants the company believes that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position

estimated liabilities for environmental remediation are recorded when amounts are probable and estimable amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism are recorded as a regulatory asset

electric and magnetic fields emfs

although scientists continue to research the possibility that exposure to emfs causes adverse health effects science has not demonstrated a causeandeffect relationship between exposure to the type of emfs emitted by power lines and other electrical facilities and adverse health effects some laboratory studies suggest that such exposure creates biological effects but those effects have not been shown to be harmful the studies that have most concerned the public are epidemiological studies some of which have reported a weak correlation between childhood leukemia and the proximity of homes to certain power lines and equipment other epidemiological studies found no correlation between estimated exposure and any disease scientists cannot explain why some studies using estimates of past exposure report correlations between estimated emf levels and disease while others do not

to respond to public concerns the cpuc previously directed california ious to adopt a lowcost emfreduction policy that requires reasonable design changes to achieve noticeable reduction of emf levels that are anticipated from new projects the cpuc has recently reviewed the resultant policy in an order instituting ratemaking and found no new scientific research to support a change to the existing policy finding existing policy of prudent avoidance to be sufficient and reasonable

air and water quality 

the transmission and distribution of natural gas require the operation of compressor stations which are subject to increasingly stringent airquality standards costs to comply with these standards are recovered in rates

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other owners of songs previously reached agreement with the california coastal commission to mitigate the environmental damage to the marine environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs units 2 and 3 sdges share of the cost is estimated to be 34 million of which 16 million had been incurred at december 31 2005 rate recovery of 50 of the remaining costs is uncertain

other matters

research development and demonstration rdd

effective january 2005 a surcharge was established by the cpuc for natural gas public interest rdd the natural gas public interest research program is administered by the cec for 2005 the funding level is subject to a statewide cap of 12 million the statewide cap increases to 15 million in 2006 for 2005 socalgas and sdge funding for the natural gas public purpose rdd program was 6 million and 1 million respectively in addition socalgas operates a separate natural gas rdd program as discussed below

the socalgas ratepayerfunded rdd program is focused on utility operations end use utilization advanced distributed power generation and transportation each of these activities provides benefits to customers and society by providing more costeffective efficient natural gas equipment with lower emissions increased safety and reduced operating costs for 2005 socalgas rdd expenditures were 11 million and expenditures averaged 9 million over the past three years

company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f the company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the companys reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission and is accumulated and communicated to the companys management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating these controls and procedures management recognizes that any system of controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives and necessarily applies judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of other possible controls and procedures in addition the company has investments in unconsolidated entities that it does not control or manage and consequently its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to these entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those it maintains with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries

during the year ended december 31 2005 management outsourced certain human resource payroll and employee benefit functions to a thirdparty service provider and implemented a new software application that automates the calculation of the income tax provision the changes strengthen the design and effectiveness of the internal controls and improve the efficiency of these systems as part of the conversion processes management performed substantial testing of related internal controls intended to provide reasonable assurances that the converted data and subsequent ongoing process meet the companys objective to provide reliable financial reporting management has determined that the design of the controls surrounding these new processes satisfies the control objectives and that the controls are operating effectively

except for these changes there have been no changes in the companys internal controls over financial reporting during the companys most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal controls over financial reporting 

the company evaluates the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission under the supervision and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2005 the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level

           risks related to the california utilities

the california utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state
federal and local legislation and regulatory authorities which may
adversely affect the operations performance and growth of their
businesses

the california public utilities commission cpuc which consists of
five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for
staggered sixyear terms regulates the california utilities rates
except electric transmission rates which are regulated by the federal
energy regulatory commission ferc and conditions of service sales
of securities rates of return rates of depreciation uniform systems
of accounts examination of records and longterm resource procurement
the cpuc conducts various reviews of utility performance including
reasonableness and prudency reviews and affiliate relationships and
conducts audits and investigations into various matters which may from
time to time result in disallowances and penalties adversely affecting
earnings and cash flows various proceedings involving the cpuc and
relating to the california utilities rates costs incentive
mechanisms performancebased regulation and compliance with affiliate
and holding company rules are discussed in the notes to consolidated
financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations

periodically the california utilities rates are approved by the cpuc
based on forecasts of capital and operating costs if the california
utilities actual capital and operating costs were to exceed the amount
included in its base rates approved by the cpuc it would adversely
affect earnings and cash flows

to promote efficient operations and improved productivity and to move
away from reasonableness reviews and disallowances the cpuc adopted
performancebased regulation pbr for the california utilities under
pbr regulators require future income potential to be tied to achieving
or exceeding specific performance and productivity goals rather than
relying solely on expanding utility plant to increase earnings the
three areas that are eligible for pbr rewards are operational
incentives based on measurements of safety reliability and customer
satisfaction energy efficiency rewards based on the effectiveness of
the programs and natural gas procurement rewards although the
california utilities have received significant pbr rewards in the past
there can be no assurance that the california utilities will receive
rewards at similar levels in the future or at all additionally if
the california utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance
levels established under the pbr mechanisms they may be assessed
financial disallowances or penalties which could adversely affect their
earnings and cash flows

the ferc regulates electric transmission rates the transmission and
wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce transmission
access and other similar matters involving sdge

the california utilities may be impacted by new regulations decisions
orders or interpretations of the cpuc ferc or other regulatory bodies
new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations
could change how the california utilities operate could affect their


page6


ability to recover their various costs through rates or adjustment
mechanisms or could require the california utilities to incur
additional expenses

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its
ownership of nuclear facilities

sdge owns a 20 interest in the san onofre nuclear generating station
songs a 2150 megawatt nuclear generating facility near san
clemente california the nuclear regulatory commission nrc has broad
authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated
requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities
sdges ownership interest in songs subjects it to the risks of nuclear
generation which include

	the potential harmful effects on the environment and human
health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities
and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive
materials
	limitations on the amounts and types of insurance
commercially available to cover losses that might arise in
connection with nuclear operations and
	uncertainties with respect to the technological and
financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the
end of their licensed lives

the california utilities future results of operations and financial
condition may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending
litigation against them

the california energy crisis of 2000 and 2001 has generated numerous
lawsuits governmental investigations and regulatory proceedings
involving many energy companies including sempra energy and the
california utilities they are the remaining defendants in class action
and individual antitrust and unfair competition lawsuits scheduled for a
jury trial to begin in september 2005 in which the plaintiffs have
asserted that they are entitled to recover 24 billion in damages
additional lawsuits have been filed by the attorney general of nevada and
by others they are also responding to an ongoing investigation being
conducted by the california attorney general and an ongoing cpuc
proceeding related to the increase in natural gas prices at the
californiaarizona border in 20002001 the california utilities have
expended and continue to expend substantial amounts defending these
lawsuits and in connection with related investigations and regulatory
proceedings if these matters are ultimately resolved unfavorably to the
california utilities their results of operations and financial condition
and those of sempra energy may be materially adversely affected

these proceedings are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial
statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations

   risks related to sempra energys electric generation commodities
  trading liquefied natural gas lng pipelines  storage and other
                            businesses

sempra energys businesses are exposed to market risk and its financial
condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be
adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity market prices that are
beyond its control

sempra commodities is a fullservice trading company that markets and
trades physical and financial commodity products its trading portfolios
consist of physical and financial commodity contracts including
contracts for natural gas electricity petroleum products base metals
and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity
or cash although sempra commodities generally seeks to structure its
trading contracts so that a substantial majority of its trading revenues
are realizable within 24 months and strives to maintain appropriate
hedging mechanisms for its trading book sempra commodities may have
substantial unhedged trading positions in the market resulting from the
management of its trading portfolios or from its inability to hedge in
whole or in part particular risks

sempra generation generates electricity that it sells under longterm
contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets it
purchases fuel for its power plants consisting of natural gas and coal
and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy its
contractual obligations

sempra energys sales and results of operations could be adversely
affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas
coal or other commodities whether procured for power plants or to
satisfy contractual obligations with trading counterparties or customers
in regional markets and other competitive markets in which the company
competes change in a direction or manner that it has not anticipated and
for which it has not provided through purchase or sale commitments or
other hedging transactions

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated and other
commodities result from multiple factors including weather conditions
seasonality changes in demand transmission or transportation
constraints or inefficiencies availability of competitively priced
alternative energy sources commodity production levels actions by the
organization of the petroleum exporting countries with respect to the
supply of crude oil federal state and foreign energy and environmental
regulation and legislation natural disasters wars embargoes and other
catastrophic events and expropriation of assets by foreign countries

in 2001 the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power and
transmission rates independent system operators and other entities that
control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales
in some of the markets in which the company operates imposed price
limitations which resulted in unexpected moves in electricity prices the
ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules and other
mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time to time in
the future any such action by the ferc may result in prices for
electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and may



page8


have an adverse effect on sempra energys sales and results of
operations

sempra energy and its subsidiaries cannot and do not attempt to fully
hedge their assets or positions against changes in commodity prices and
their hedging procedures may not work as planned

to reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations
sempra energys subsidiaries routinely enter into contracts to hedge a
substantial portion of their purchase and sale commitments and
inventories of electricity natural gas coal crude oil and refined
petroleum products base metals and other commodities as part of this
strategy they routinely utilize fixedprice forward physical purchase
and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded
in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges however the company
does not cover the entire exposure of its assets or its positions to
market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time to the
extent sempra energys subsidiaries have unhedged positions or if their
hedging positions do not work as planned fluctuating commodity prices
could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys business results
of operations cash flows and financial condition

risk management procedures may not prevent losses

although sempra energy and its subsidiaries have risk management systems
and control systems in place that use advanced methodologies to quantify
and manage risk these systems may not always prevent material losses
risk management procedures may not always be followed or may not always
work as planned in addition daily valueatrisk and loss limits are
derived from historic price movements if prices significantly or
persistently deviate from historic prices the limits may not protect the
company from significant losses as a result of these and other factors
there can be no assurances that sempra energys risk management
procedures will prevent losses that would negatively affect its business
results of operations cash flows and financial condition

a downgrade in sempra energys credit ratings could negatively affect its
commodities trading and other nonutility businesses

if sempra energys credit ratings were to be downgraded the business
prospects of its commodities trading and other nonutility businesses
which generally rely on the creditworthiness of sempra energy would be
adversely affected sempra commodities would be required to comply with
various margin or other credit enhancement obligations under its trading
and marketing contracts substantially all of which are guaranteed by
sempra energy and it may be unable to continue to trade or able to do so
only on lessfavorable terms to meet liquidity requirements sempra
energy and its subsidiaries maintain substantial unused committed lines
of credit for which borrowings are available without regard to credit
ratings however a ratings downgrade could require sempra energy to
divert to sempra commodities all or a portion of the liquidity that these
lines would otherwise provide for the expansion of sempra energys other
nonutility businesses in addition if these lines were to become
unavailable or to be inadequate to meet margin or other credit
enhancement requirements sempra commodities trading partners could
exercise other remedies such as liquidating and netting their exposures
to sempra commodities making it more difficult or impossible for sempra



page9


commodities to manage effectively its remaining trading positions or to
continue its trading business and sempra energy and its subsidiaries may
not have sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations

sempra energys businesses depend on counterparties customers and
suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements and any failure
by them to perform could require the company to incur substantial
expenses and expose it to commodity price risk and volatility which
could adversely affect sempra energys liquidity cash flows and results
of operations

sempra energys subsidiaries are exposed to the risk that counterparties
customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of
market transactions or other longterm agreements will not perform their
obligations under such agreements should they fail to perform the
company may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to
honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices in such
event sempra energys subsidiaries may incur additional losses to the
extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers in
addition the subsidiaries often extend credit to counterparties and
customers while the company performs significant credit analyses prior
to extending credit sempra energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to
the risk that they may not be able to collect amounts owed to them

if the department of water resources dwr were to succeed in setting
aside or were to fail to perform its obligations under its longterm
power contract with sempra generation sempra energys business results
of operations and cash flows will be materially adversely affected

in 2001 sempra generation entered into a 10year power sales agreement
with the dwr to supply up to 1900 megawatts to the state sempra energy
expects the contract with the dwr will be a source of significant revenue
over the 10year period the validity of the power sales agreement with
the dwr has been the subject of extensive litigation between the parties
before the ferc and in california courts sempra generation has prevailed
in all of these challenges to date but the plaintiffs have appealed
several of these rulings if the dwr were to succeed in setting aside its
obligations under the contract or if the dwr fails or is unable to meet
its contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material
adverse effect on sempra energys business results of operations cash
flows and financial condition these proceedings are described in the
notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations

in the future sempra energys subsidiaries may elect not to or may not
be able to enter into longterm supply and sales agreements or longterm
firm capacity agreements for their projects which would subject their
sales to increased volatility and its businesses to increased
competition

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries have become
highly competitive as more plants are built and competitive pressures
increase wholesale electricity prices become more volatile without the
benefit of longterm power sales agreements such as the 10year power
sales agreement between sempra generation and the dwr sempra energys
sales will be subject to increased price volatility and it may be unable


page10


to sell the power generated by sempra generations facilities or operate
those facilities profitably

sempra lng does not intend to commence significant construction of its
proposed lng terminals without first obtaining longterm lng supply
agreements that substantially reduce its exposure to changes in natural
gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or supply
prices tied to prevailing natural gas prices or longterm firm capacity
agreements for a substantial portion of the processing capacity of these
facilities however if these plans were to change and the company were
to construct its terminals without the benefit of such arrangements its
sales would be subject to increased price volatility and it may be
unable to sell the services of its lng facilities or to operate the
facilities profitably if the counterparties customers or suppliers to
one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail or
become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis it
could have a significant negative impact on sempra energys business
results of operations cash flows and financial condition

business development activities may not be successful and projects under
construction may not commence operation as scheduled which could
increase sempra energys costs and impair its ability to recover its
investments

the acquisition development and construction of electric generating
facilities lng receiving terminals and natural gas pipelines and
storage facilities involve numerous risks sempra energy and its
subsidiaries may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary
engineering permitting fuel supply resource exploration legal and
other expenses before it can be established whether a project is
feasible economically attractive or capable of being built sempra
energys success in developing a particular project is contingent upon
among other things negotiation of satisfactory engineering procurement
and construction agreements fuel supply and power sales contracts for
generating facilities supply and natural gas sales agreements or firm
capacity service agreements for lng receiving terminals and natural gas
pipelines and storage facilities receipt of required governmental
permits and timely implementation and satisfactory completion of
construction and successful completion of a particular project may be
adversely affected by unforeseen engineering problems construction
delays and contractor performance shortfalls work stoppages adverse
weather conditions environmental and geological conditions and other
factors if the company is unable to complete the development of a
facility it typically will not be able to recover its investment in the
project

the operation of these facilities also involves many risks including the
breakdown or failure of generation or regasification and storage
facilities or other equipment or processes labor disputes fuel
interruption and operating performance below expected levels in
addition weatherrelated incidents and other natural disasters can
disrupt generation regasification storage and transmission systems the
occurrence of any of these events could lead to operating power plants
below expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or
increased expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties and
could adversely affect sempra energys business cash flows and results
of operations


page11


competition among developers and operators of lng terminals is rapidly
increasing which may adversely affect the profitability of sempra lngs
proposed lng terminals

although there are only a limited number of lng terminal facilities
operating in north america today many companies have announced plans to
develop lng facilities to serve the north american market some of these
competitors have more operating experience more development experience
larger staffs and greater financial resources than the company industry
analysts have predicted that if all of the proposed lng facilities in
north america that have been announced by developers are actually built
there will likely be substantial excess capacity for such terminals in
the near future excess capacity is likely to lead to decreased prices
for such services although its proposed lng facilities in mexico and
louisiana are more advanced in the siting permitting and regulatory
approval processes than the proposed projects of many of its competitors
there can be no assurance that sempra energy will be able to maintain
that advantage

sempra energys subsidiaries rely on transportation assets that they do
not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas

sempra energys subsidiaries depend on electric transmission lines
natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and
operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas they
sell to wholesale markets to supply natural gas and coal to their
electric generation facilities and to provide retail energy services to
customers sempra lng also will rely on specialized lng ships to
transport lng to its proposed lng facilities and on natural gas pipelines
to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities if
transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate the ability of
sempra energys subsidiaries to sell and deliver their products and
services may be hindered as a result they may be responsible for
damages incurred by their customers such as the additional cost of
acquiring alternative supply at thencurrent spot market rates

sempra energys businesses require numerous permits and other
governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign
governmental agencies and any failure to obtain or maintain required
permits or approvals could cause sempra energys sales to decline andor
its costs to increase

the acquisition ownership and operation of electric generation
facilities lng receiving terminals and natural gas pipelines and
storage facilities require numerous permits approvals and certificates
from federal state local and foreign governmental agencies all of the
existing and planned development projects of sempra energys subsidiaries
require multiple permits they may not be able to obtain or maintain all
required regulatory approvals if there is a delay in obtaining any
required regulatory approvals or if the company fails to obtain any
required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations
it may not be able to operate its facilities or it may be forced to
incur additional costs


page12


sempra energys businesses are subject to complex government regulations
and may be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their
interpretation or implementation

in recent years the regulatory environment applicable to the electric
power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on
both federal and state levels which have affected the nature of these
industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their
businesses these changes are ongoing and sempra energy cannot predict
the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the
ultimate affect that this changing regulatory environment will have on
its businesses moreover existing regulations may be revised or
reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become
applicable to the company and its facilities future changes in laws and
regulations may have a detrimental effect on sempra energys business
cash flows financial condition and results of operations

sempra energys energy and commodity trading operations are subject to
affiliate rules relating to transactions with the california utilities
these businesses could be adversely affected by changes in these rules or
by additional cpuc or ferc rules further restricting their ability to
sell electricity or natural gas or to trade with the california
utilities affiliate transaction rules also could require these
businesses to obtain the prior approval of the cpuc before entering into
any such transactions with the california utilities any such
restrictions or approval requirements could adversely affect the electric
generation plants natural gas pipelines lng receiving terminals or
trading operations of the companys subsidiaries

various proceedings inquiries and investigations relating to the
business activities of sempra generation and sempra commodities are
currently pending before the ferc a description of such proceedings
inquiries and investigations is provided in the notes to consolidated
financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations

sempra energys businesses have significant environmental compliance
costs and future environmental compliance costs could adversely affect
sempra energys profitability

sempra energys subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state
local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to
environmental protection they are required to obtain numerous
governmental permits licenses and other approvals to construct and
operate their businesses additionally to comply with these legal
requirements they must spend significant sums on environmental
monitoring pollution control equipment and emissions fees the company
also is generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated with
the environmental condition of its electric generation facilities and
other energy projects which it has acquired or developed regardless of
when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown if
sempra energys subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable environmental
laws they may be subject to penalties fines andor curtailments of
their operations

the scope and effect of any new environmental laws and regulations
including their affects on operations are difficult to predict however


page13


increasing national and international concerns regarding global warming
and proposed regulations regarding mercury nitrogen oxide and sulfur
dioxide emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution
control equipment or significant emissions fees or taxes particularly
with respect to coalfired generation facilities that could adversely
affect sempra generation in addition existing environmental regulations
could be revised or reinterpreted and other new laws and regulations
could be adopted or become applicable to the company and its facilities

sempra energys international businesses are exposed to different local
regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a material
adverse effect on sempra energys financial condition cash flows and
results of operations

sempra energy subsidiaries currently have interests in electricity
generation natural gas transmission and lng terminal projects in mexico
and also have trading marketing and risk management operations in
canada europe and asia sempra pipelines  storage also has ownership
interests in electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in
argentina chile and peru developing infrastructure projects owning
energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject
the company to significant political and financial risks which vary by
country including

	changes in foreign laws and regulations including tax and
environmental laws and regulations
	changes in us laws and regulations including tax and
environmental laws and regulations related to foreign
operations
	high rates of inflation
	changes in government policies or personnel
	trade restrictions
	limitations on us company ownership in foreign countries
	permitting and regulatory compliance
	changes in labor supply and labor relations in operations
outside the us
	adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals and difficulty
in enforcing contractual rights in foreign jurisdictions and
	general political economic and business conditions

sempra energys international businesses also are subject to foreign
currency risks these risks arise from both volatility in foreign
currency exchange rates and devaluations of foreign currencies in such
cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could
reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign


page14


subsidiaries for example the devaluation of the argentine peso against
the us dollar in recent years as well as the argentine governments
unilateral retroactive abrogation of utility agreements in early 2002
has had a material adverse effect on sempra pipelines  storages two
unconsolidated subsidiaries in argentina on september 6 2002 sempra
pipelines  storage initiated arbitration proceedings under the 1994
bilateral investment treaty between the us and argentina for recovery
of the diminution of the value of its investments that has resulted from
argentine governmental actions sempra pipelines  storage has claimed
damages of at least 258 million in these proceedings which are
continuing a description of legal proceedings relating to sempra
pipelines  storages business operations in argentina is provided in the
notes to consolidated financial statements while sempra pipelines 
storage believes that it has contracts and other measures in place to
mitigate its most significant foreign currency exchange risks it has
some exposure that is not fully mitigated

               other risks related to the company

sempra energys cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet
its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its
subsidiaries

sempra energy is a holding company and conducts its operations entirely
through its subsidiaries sempra energys california utilities are its
major source of liquidity funding of other business units capital
expenditures is largely dependent on the california utilities paying
sufficient dividends to sempra energy which depends on the sufficiency
of utility earnings and cash flows in excess of utility needs in
addition sempra energys cash flows ability to meet its obligations to
creditors and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock are
largely dependent upon the earnings of the subsidiaries and the
distribution of such earnings to sempra energy in the form of dividends
the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be
precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances
including as a result of legislation or regulation or in times of
financial distress

natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could
materially adversely affect sempra energys business earnings and cash
flows

like other major industrial facilities sempra energys generation plants
including songs electric transmission facilities lng receiving
terminals and storage facilities chartered oil and lng tankers and
natural gas pipelines and storage facilities may be damaged by natural
disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism any such
incidents could result in severe business disruptions significant
decreases in revenues or significant additional costs to the company
which could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys earnings
and cash flows given the nature and location of these facilities any
such incidents also could cause fires leaks explosions spills or other
significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third
parties or personal injuries which could lead to significant claims
against sempra energy and its subsidiaries insurance coverage may become
unavailable for certain of these risks and the insurance proceeds
received for any loss of or damage to any of its facilities or for any


page15


loss of or damage to natural resources or property or personal injuries
caused by its operations may be insufficient to cover the companys
losses or liabilities without materially adversely affecting the
companys financial condition earnings and cash flows

government regulation

the most significant government regulation affecting sempra energy is
that affecting its utility subsidiaries

california utility regulation

the cpuc which consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor
of california for staggered sixyear terms regulates sdges and
socalgas rates and conditions of service sales of securities rate of
return rates of depreciation uniform systems of accounts examination
of records and longterm resource procurement the cpuc conducts various
reviews of utility performance and conducts investigations into various
matters such as deregulation competition and the environment to
determine its future policies the cpuc also regulates the relationship
of utilities with their holding companies and is currently conducting an
investigation into this relationship this investigation is further
discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the california energy commission cec has discretion over electric
demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories
based upon these forecasts the cec determines the need for additional
energy sources and for conservation programs the cec sponsors
alternativeenergy research and development projects promotes energy
conservation programs and maintains a statewide plan of action in case
of energy shortages in addition the cec certifies powerplant sites and
related facilities within california

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of supply availability and prices for
every market sector consuming natural gas in california this forecast
includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural gas demand
and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and distribution this
analysis is used to support longterm investment decisions

united states utility regulation

the ferc regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas
the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate
commerce transmission access the uniform systems of accounts rates of
depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale both the ferc
and the cpuc are currently investigating prices charged to the california
investorowned utilities ious by various suppliers of natural gas and
electricity further discussion is provided in notes 14 and 15 of the
notes to consolidated financial statements

the nrc oversees the licensing construction and operation of nuclear
facilities nrc regulations require extensive review of the safety
radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities periodically
the nrc requires that newly developed data and techniques be used to re
analyze the design of a nuclear power plant and as a result requires
plant modifications as a condition of continued operation in some cases

local regulation

socalgas has natural gas franchises with the 240 legal jurisdictions in
its service territory these franchises allow socalgas to locate operate
and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural
gas in streets and other public places some franchises have fixed terms
such as that for the city of los angeles which expires in 2012 the
range of expiration dates for the franchises with definite terms is 2005

customers

for regulatory purposes customers are separated into core and noncore
customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial
and industrial customers without alternative fuel capability noncore
customers consist primarily of electric generation wholesale large
commercial industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from the california
utilities core customers are permitted to aggregate their natural gas
requirement and purchase directly from brokers or producers the
california utilities continue to be obligated to purchase reliable
supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of the core customers


page18


natural gas procurement and transportation

most of the natural gas purchased and delivered by the california
utilities is produced outside of california primarily in the
southwestern us and canada the california utilities purchase natural
gas under shortterm and longterm contracts shortterm purchases are
primarily based on monthly spotmarket prices

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to the distribution
system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas
is committed to firm pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment
of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation entitlements
socalgas sells excess capacity if any on a shortterm basis interstate
pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas company and
transwestern pipeline company provide transportation services into
socalgas intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by
socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of california all
of these contracts will have expired by 2007 the rates that interstate
pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services
are regulated by the ferc

sdge has longterm natural gas transportation contracts with various
interstate pipelines that expire on various dates between 2005 and 2023
sdge currently purchases natural gas on a spot basis to fill its long
term pipeline capacity and purchases additional spot market supplies
delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements sdge
continues its ongoing assessment of its pipeline capacity portfolio
including the release of a portion of this capacity to third parties in
accordance with regulatory directives sdge will reconfigure its
pipeline capacity portfolio by november 2005 to secure firm
transportation rights from a diverse mix of us and canadian supply
sources for its projected core customer natural gas requirements all of
sdges natural gas is delivered through socalgas pipelines under a
shortterm transportation agreement in addition under a separate
agreement expiring in march 2006 socalgas provides sdge eight billion
cubic feet of storage capacity

according to btus daily gas wire the annual average spot price of
natural gas at the californiaarizona border was 553 per million
british thermal unit mmbtu in 2004 635 per mmbtu in december 2004
compared with 510 per mmbtu in 2003 and 314 per mmbtu in 2002 prices
for natural gas increased toward the end of 2002 2003 and in 2004  the
california utilities weighted average cost including transportation
charges per mmbtu of natural gas was 594 in 2004 506 in 2003 and
312 in 2002

with improved delivery capacity to california the company expects
adequate resources to be available at prices that generally will follow
national natural gas pricing trends and volatility

natural gas storage

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for use by the core
noncore and offsystem customers core customers are allocated a portion
of socalgas storage capacity remaining customers including sdge can
bid and negotiate the desired amount of storage on a contract basis the


page19


storage service program provides opportunities for customers to store
natural gas usually during the summer to reduce winter purchases when
natural gas costs are generally higher this allows customers to select
the level of service they desire to assist them in managing their fuel
procurement and transportation needs

demand for natural gas

the california utilities face competition in the residential and
commercial customer markets based on the customers preferences for
natural gas compared with other energy products the demand for natural
gas by electric generators is influenced by a number of factors in the
shortterm natural gas use by electric generators is impacted by the
availability of alternative sources of generation the availability of
hydroelectricity is highly dependent on precipitation in the western
united states in addition natural gas use is impacted by the
performance of other generation sources in the western united states
including nuclear and coal and other natural gas facilities outside the
service area natural gas use is also impacted by changes in enduse
electricity demand for example natural gas use generally increases
during summer heat waves over the longterm natural gas use will be
greatly influenced by additional factors such as the location of new
power plant construction more generation capacity currently is being
constructed outside southern california than within the california
utilities service area this new generation will likely displace the
output of older less efficient local generation reducing use of natural
gas for local electric generation

effective march 31 1998 electric industry restructuring provided out
ofstate producers the option to purchase energy for california utility
customers as a result natural gas demand for electric generation within
southern california competes with electric power generated throughout the
western united states although electric industry restructuring has no
direct impact on the california utilities natural gas operations future
volumes of natural gas transported for electric generating plant
customers may be significantly affected to the extent that regulatory
changes divert electric generation from the california utilities service
area

growth in the natural gas markets is largely dependent upon the health
and expansion of the southern california economy and prices of other
energy products external factors such as weather the price of
electricity electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power
competing pipelines and general economic conditions can result in
significant shifts in demand and market price the california utilities
added 86000 and 83000 new natural gas customer meters in 2004 and 2003
respectively representing growth rates of 14 percent in both cases the
california utilities expect that their growth rate for 2005 will
approximate that for 2004

in the interruptible industrial market customers are capable of burning
a fuel other than natural gas fuel oil is the most significant competing
energy alternative the companys ability to maintain its industrial
market share is largely dependent on price the relationship between
natural gas supply and demand has the greatest impact on the price of the
companys product with the reduction of natural gas production from
domestic sources the cost of natural gas from nondomestic sources may


page20


play a greater role in the companys competitive position in the future
the price of oil depends upon a number of factors including the
relationship between worldwide supply and demand and the policies of
foreign and domestic governments

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal in nature as variations
in weather conditions generally result in greater revenues during the
winter months when temperatures are colder as is prevalent in the
industry the company injects natural gas into storage during the summer
months usually april through october for withdrawal from storage during
the winter months usually november through march when customer demand
is higher

in july 2004 sempra financial sold its investment in an enterprise that
earns section 29 income tax credits that investment comprised onethird
of sempra energys section 29 participation the rest being held by
sempra commodities and was sold because the companys alternative
minimum tax position defers utilization of the credits in the
determination of income taxes currently payable the transaction has been
accounted for under the costrecovery method whereby future proceeds in
excess of the carrying value of the investment will be recorded as income
when they are received as a result of this sale sempra financial will
not be receiving section 29 income tax credits in the future

environmental matters

discussions about environmental issues affecting the company are included
in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the
following additional information should be read in conjunction with those
discussions

hazardous substances

in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative memorandum
account allowing californias ious to recover their hazardous waste
cleanup costs including those related to superfund sites or similar
sites requiring cleanup cleanup costs at sites related to electric
generation were specifically excluded from the collaborative by the cpuc
recovery of 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related
thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related insurance
litigation expenses is permitted in addition the company has the
opportunity to retain a percentage of any insurance recoveries to offset
the 10 percent of costs not recovered in rates

during the early 1900s the california utilities and their predecessors
manufactured gas from coal or oil the manufacturedgas plants mgps
often have become contaminated with the hazardous residual byproducts of
the process socalgas has identified 42 such sites at which it together
with other users as to 21 of these sites may have cleanup obligations
at a minimum preliminary investigations have been completed on 41 of the
sites as of december 31 2004 27 of these sites have been remediated
of which 22 have received certification from the california environmental
protection agency at december 31 2004 socalgas estimated remaining
investigation and remediation liability for the mgps is 405 million
sdge identified three former mgps two of which were remediated in 1998
and 2000 with closure letters being received the estimated remaining
remediation liability on the third site is 18 million

sdge sold its fossilfuel generating facilities in 1999 as a part of
its due diligence for the sale sdge conducted a thorough environmental
assessment of the facilities pursuant to the sale agreements for such
facilities sdge and the buyers have apportioned responsibility for such
environmental conditions generally based on contamination existing at the
time of transfer and the cleanup level necessary for the continued use of
the sites as industrial sites while the sites are relatively clean the
assessments identified some instances of significant contamination
principally resulting from hydrocarbon releases for which sdge has a
cleanup obligation under the agreement estimated costs to perform the
necessary remediation are 11 million these costs were offset against
the sales price for the facilities together with other appropriate
costs and the remaining net proceeds were included in the calculation of
customer rates remediation of the plants commenced in early 2001 during
2002 cleanup was completed at several minor sites at a cost of 04
million in late 2002 additional assessments were started at the primary
sites where cleanup commenced in 2003 and is expected to be completed
during 2005 in 2003 cleanup was completed at the encina power plant
site at a cost of 08 million in 2004 cleanup was completed at two
combustion turbine sites at a cost of 07 million

the california utilities lawfully dispose of wastes at permitted
facilities owned and operated by other entities operations at these


page29


facilities may result in actual or threatened risks to the environment or
public health under california law businesses that arrange for legal
disposal of wastes at a permitted facility from which wastes are later
released or threaten to be released can be held financially responsible
for corrective actions at the facility

the company and certain subsidiaries are named as potentially responsible
parties prps for one landfill site and two industrial waste disposal
sites from which releases have occurred

remedial actions and negotiations with other prps and the united states
environmental protection agency have been in progress since 1993 for the
casmalia landfill site the companys share of costs to remediate this
site is estimated to be 13 million of which 09 million has been
spent

in december 1999 socalgas was notified that it is a prp at a waste
treatment facility in bakersfield california socalgas is working with
other prps in order to remove from the site certain liquid wastes that
threaten to be released socalgas share of total site cleanup costs is
estimated at 07 million of which 02 million has been spent

the company and 10 other entities have been named prps by the department
of toxic substance control dtsc as liable for any required corrective
action regarding contamination at an industrial waste disposal site in
pico rivera california dtsc has taken this action because sdge and
others sold used transformers to the sites owner sdge and the other
prps have entered into a costsharing agreement to provide funding for
the implementation of a consent order between dtsc and the site owner for
the development of a cleanup plan sdges interim share under the
agreement is 10 percent subject to adjustment based on allocations of
responsibility the total estimate for all prps is 1 million for the
development of the cleanup plan and 2 million to 8 million for the
actual cleanup since inception sdges share of the cleanup expenses
and plan development was 02 million cleanup is expected to commence in
2005

at december 31 2004 the companys estimated remaining investigation and
remediation liability related to hazardous waste sites including the
mgps was 446 million of which 90 percent is authorized to be
recovered through the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism this
estimated cost excludes remediation costs associated with sdges former
fossilfuel power plants the company believes that any costs not
ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not
have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of
operations or financial position

estimated liabilities for environmental remediation are recorded when
amounts are probable and estimable amounts authorized to be recovered in
rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism are recorded as a
regulatory asset

electric and magnetic fields emfs

although scientists continue to research the possibility that exposure to
emfs causes adverse health effects science has not demonstrated a cause
andeffect relationship between exposure to the type of emfs emitted by



page30


power lines and other electrical facilities and adverse health effects
some laboratory studies suggest that such exposure creates biological
effects but those effects have not been shown to be harmful the studies
that have most concerned the public are epidemiological studies some of
which have reported a weak correlation between the proximity of homes to
certain power lines and equipment and childhood leukemia other
epidemiological studies found no correlation between estimated exposure
and any disease scientists cannot explain why some studies using
estimates of past exposure report correlations between estimated emf
levels and disease while others do not

to respond to public concerns the cpuc has directed california ious to
adopt a lowcost emfreduction policy that requires reasonable design
changes to achieve noticeable reduction of emf levels that are
anticipated from new projects however consistent with the major
scientific reviews of the available research literature the cpuc has
indicated that no health risk has been identified during 2004 the cpuc
instituted a rulemaking to reexamine its policies related to emfs and
determine whether the current mitigation policies and utility directives
should be updated in light of science that has developed over the last
decade

air and water quality

californias air quality standards are more restrictive than federal
standards however as a result of the sale of the companys fossilfuel
generating facilities the companys primary airquality issue
compliance with these standards now has had less significance to the
companys operation that is changing as sempra generation operates more
generating facilities

the transmission and distribution of natural gas require the operation of
compressor stations which are subject to increasingly stringent air
quality standards costs to comply with these standards are recovered in
rates

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the other
owners of songs previously reached agreement with the california coastal
commission to mitigate the environmental damage to the marine environment
attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs units 2 and 3 this
mitigation program includes an enhanced fishprotection system a 150
acre artificial kelp reef and restoration of 150 acres of coastal
wetlands in addition the owners must deposit 36 million with the
state for the enhancement of fish hatchery programs and pay for
monitoring and oversight of the mitigation projects sdges share of the
cost is estimated to be 34 million these mitigation projects are
expected to be completed in 2008 through december 31 2003 songs
mitigation costs were recovered through the incremental cost incentive
pricing mechanism songs mitigation costs incurred after december 31
2003 are being capitalized and recovered from ratepayers over the
remaining life of the songs units subject to cpuc approval in the edison
rate case additional information on songs cost recovery is provided in
note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

utilities actual capital and operating costs were to exceed the amount
included in its base rates approved by the cpuc it would adversely
affect earnings and cash flows

to promote efficient operations and improved productivity and to move
away from reasonableness reviews and disallowances the cpuc adopted
performancebased regulation pbr for sdge effective in 1994 and for
socalgas effective in 1997 under pbr regulators require future income
potential to be tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and
productivity goals rather than relying solely on expanding utility
plant to increase earnings  the three areas that are eligible for pbr
rewards are  operational incentives based on measurements of safety
reliability and customer satisfaction demandside management dsm
rewards based on the effectiveness of the programs and natural gas
procurement rewards  although the california utilities have received
significant pbr rewards in the past there can be no assurance that the
california utilities will receive rewards at similar levels in the
future or at all  additionally if the california utilities fail to
achieve certain minimum performance levels established under the pbr
mechanisms they may be assessed financial disallowances or penalties
which could adversely affect their earnings and cash flows

the ferc regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity
in interstate commerce transmission access and other similar matters
involving sdge

the california utilities may be impacted by new regulations decisions
orders or interpretations of the cpuc ferc or other regulatory bodies
new legislation regulations decisions orders or interpretations could
change how the california utilities operate could affect their ability
to recover their various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms
or could require the california utilities to incur additional expenses

sdge may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its
ownership of nuclear facilities

sdge owns a 20 interest in the san onofre nuclear generating station
songs a 2150 megawatt nuclear generating facility near san clemente

california  the nuclear regulatory commission has broad authority under
federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the
operation of nuclear generation facilities  sdges ownership interest
in songs subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation which include

 the potential harmful effects on the environment and human
   health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities
   and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive
   materials
 limitations on the amounts and types of insurance
   commercially available to cover losses that might arise in
   connection with nuclear operations and
 uncertainties with respect to the technological and

the california utilities future results of operations and financial
condition may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending
litigation against them

lawsuits filed in 2000 and currently consolidated in san diego superior
court seek classaction certification and damages alleging sempra
energy and the california utilities along with el paso energy corp and
several of its affiliates unlawfully sought to control natural gas
markets  similar lawsuits have been filed by the attorneys general of
arizona and nevada and by others  although the california utilities
expect to prevail in these cases they have expended or accrued
substantial amounts to pay the costs of defending these claims  if the
plaintiffs in these cases were to prevail in their claims the future
results of operations and financial condition of sempra energy and the
california utilities may be materially adversely affected in addition
various other lawsuits are pending against sdge and other sempra energy
subsidiaries alleging that the companies unlawfully manipulated the
electric energy market

in december 2002 the cpuc approved a settlement with sdge allocating
between sdges customers and shareholders the profits from certain
intermediateterm power purchase contracts that sdge had entered into
during the early stages of californias electric utility industry
restructuring  as a result of the cpucs decision sdge recognized
additional aftertax income of 65 million in 2003  the utility
consumers action network ucan has appealed the decision and the
california court of appeals granted the petition for review

risks related to sempra energys electric generation
energy trading liquefied natural gas lng energy solutions
international and other businesses

sempra energys businesses are exposed to market risk and its financial
condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be
adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity market prices that are
beyond its control

sempra energy trading set is a fullservice trading company that
markets and trades physical and financial commodity products  its
trading portfolios consist of physical and financial commodity contracts
including contracts for natural gas electricity petroleum products
base metals and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of
the commodity or cash  although set generally seeks to structure its
trading contracts so that a substantial majority of its trading revenues
are realizable within 24 months and strives to maintain proper hedging
mechanisms for its trading book at times set may have unhedged trading
positions in the market resulting from the management of its trading
portfolios or from its inability to hedge in whole or in part
particular risks

sempra energy resources ser generates and sells electricity on a long
term basis or into the spot market or other competitive markets and
purchases natural gas for its power plants and sometimes purchases
electricity in the open market to satisfy its contractual obligations

sempra energy solutions ses procures electricity and natural gas for
its commercial and industrial customers the market prices for these
commodities may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of
time

sempra energys sales and results of operations could be adversely
affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity natural gas or
other commodities that are procured for power plants or to satisfy
contractual obligations whether to trading counterparties or
otherwise or that are provided to customers in regional markets and
other competitive markets in which the company competes change in a
direction or manner that it does not anticipate

unanticipated changes in market prices for energyrelated and other
commodities result from multiple factors including  weather
conditions seasonality changes in demand transmission or
transportation constraints or inefficiencies availability of
competitively priced alternative energy sources commodity production
levels actions by opec organization of the petroleum exporting
countries with respect to the supply of crude oil federal state and
foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation natural
disasters wars embargoes and other catastrophic events and
expropriation of assets by foreign countries

in 2001 the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power and
transmission rates and independent system operators and other entities
that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power
sales in some of the markets in which the company operates imposed
price limitations which resulted in unexpected moves in electricity
prices  the ferc may impose additional price limitations bidding rules

page8

and other mechanisms or terminate existing price limitations from time
to time in the future  any such action by the ferc may result in prices
for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and
may have an adverse effect on sempra energys sales and results of
operations

sempra energy and its subsidiaries cannot and do not attempt to fully
hedge their assets or positions against changes in commodity prices and
their hedging procedures may not work as planned

to lower financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations
sempra energys subsidiaries routinely enter into contracts to hedge a
substantial portion of their purchase and sale commitments and
inventories of electricity natural gas crude oil refined petroleum
products and other commodities  as part of this strategy they
routinely utilize fixedprice forward physical purchase and sales
contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the
overthecounter markets or on exchanges  however the company does not
always cover the entire exposure of its assets or its positions to
market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time  to the
extent sempra energy or its subsidiaries have unhedged positions or if
their hedging positions do not work as planned fluctuating commodity
prices could have a material adverse effect on sempra energys business
results of operations cash flows and financial condition

risk management procedures may not prevent losses

although sempra energy and its subsidiaries have risk management systems
and control systems in place that use advanced methodologies to quantify
risk these systems may not prevent material losses  the risk
management procedures the company has in place may not always be
followed or may not always work as planned  in addition daily value
atrisk and loss limits are derived from historic price movements  if
prices significantly deviate from historic prices the limits may not
protect the company from significant losses as a result of these and
other factors there can be no assurances that sempra energys risk
management procedures will prevent losses that would negatively affect
its business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

a downgrade in sempra energys credit ratings could negatively affect
its energy trading and other nonutility businesses

if sempra energys credit ratings were to be downgraded the business
prospects of its energy trading and other nonutility businesses which
generally rely on the creditworthiness of sempra energy would be
adversely affected  set would be required to comply with various margin
or other credit enhancement obligations under many of the trading and
marketing contracts into which it has entered substantially all of
which are guaranteed by sempra energy and it may be able to continue to
trade only on less favorable terms to meet liquidity requirements
sempra energy and its subsidiaries maintain substantial unused committed
lines of credit for which borrowings are available without regard to
credit ratings a ratings downgrade could require sempra energy to
divert to set all or a portion of the liquidity that these lines would
otherwise provide for the expansion of sempra energys other nonutility
businesses in addition if these lines were to become unavailable or to
be inadequate to meet sets margin or other credit enhancement

page9

requirements sets trading partners could exercise other remedies such
as liquidating and netting their exposures to set making it more
difficult or impossible for set to manage effectively its remaining
trading positions or to continue its trading business and sempra energy
and its subsidiaries may not have sufficient liquidity to meet their
obligations

sempra energys businesses depend on counterparties customers and
suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements and any
failure by them to perform could require the company to incur
substantial expenses and expose it to commodity price risk and
volatility which could adversely affect sempra energys liquidity cash
flows and results of operations

sempra energys subsidiaries are exposed to the risk that
counterparties customers and suppliers that owe money or energy as a
result of market transactions or other longterm agreements will not
perform their obligations under such agreements  should they fail to
perform the company may be required to acquire alternative hedging
arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent
market prices  in such event sempra energys subsidiaries may incur
additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such
counterparties or suppliers  in addition the subsidiaries often extend
credit to counterparties and customers  while the company performs
significant credit analyses prior to extending credit sempra energy and
its subsidiaries are exposed to the risk that they may not be able to
collect amounts owed to them

if the dwr were to succeed in setting aside or were to fail to perform
its obligations under its longterm power contract with ser sempra
energys business results of operations and cash flows will be
materially adversely affected

in 2001 ser entered into a 10year power sales agreement with the dwr
to supply up to 1900 megawatts to the state  sempra expects the
contract with the dwr will be a source of significant revenue over the
10year period  the validity of the power sales agreement with the dwr
has been the subject of extensive litigation between the parties before
the ferc and in california courts  although ser has prevailed in all of
these challenges to date the plaintiffs in these actions have appealed
several of these rulings  although ser expects to prevail in these
appeals if the dwr were to succeed in setting aside its obligations
under the contract or if the dwr fails or is unable to meet its
contractual obligations on a timely basis it could have a material
adverse effect on sempra energys business results of operations cash
flows and financial condition  these proceedings are described in the
notes to consolidated financial statements and in managements
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations  incorporated by reference in this report

in the future sempra energy and its subsidiaries may elect not to or
may not be able to enter into longterm supply and sales agreements or
longterm firm capacity agreements for their projects which would
subject sempra energys sales to increased volatility and its businesses
to increased competition

page10

the electric generation and wholesale power sales industries have become
highly competitive  as more plants are built and competitive pressures
increase the wholesale pricing of electricity becomes more volatile
without the benefit of longterm power sales agreements such as the 10
year power sales agreement between ser and the dwr sempra energys
sales will be subject to increased price volatility and it may be
unable to sell the power generated by sers facilities or operate those
facilities profitably

sempra energy lng corp selng does not intend to commence significant
construction of its proposed lng terminals without first entering into
longterm lng supply agreements and corresponding natural gas sales
agreements or longterm firm capacity service agreements for a
substantial portion of the processing capacity of these facilities
however if these plans were to change and the company were to construct
its terminals without the benefit of such longterm agreements its
sales would be subject to increased price volatility and it may be
unable to sell the services of its lng facilities or to operate the
facilities profitably  if the counterparties customers or suppliers to
one or more of the key agreements for the lng facilities were to fail or
become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis
it could have a significant negative impact on sempra energys business
results of operations cash flows and financial condition

business development activities may not be successful and projects under
construction may not commence operation as scheduled which could
increase sempra energys costs and impair its ability to recover its
investments

the acquisition development and construction of electric generating
facilities and lng receiving terminals involve numerous risks  sempra
energy and its subsidiaries may be required to expend significant sums
for preliminary engineering permitting fuel supply resource
exploration legal and other expenses in preparation for competitive
bids which they may not win or before it can be established whether a
project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built
sempra energys success in developing a particular project is contingent
upon among other things negotiation of satisfactory engineering
procurement and construction agreements fuel supply and power sales
contracts for generating facilities lng supply and natural gas sales
agreements or firm capacity service agreements for lng receiving
terminals receipt of required governmental permits and timely
implementation and satisfactory completion of construction  successful
completion of a particular project may also be adversely affected by
unforeseen engineering problems construction delays and contractor
performance shortfalls work stoppages adverse weather conditions
environmental and geological conditions and other factors  if the
company is unable to complete the development of a facility it
typically will not be able to recover its investment in the project

generation facilities andor lng terminals may not operate as planned
which may adversely affect sempra energys business cash flows and
results of operations

the operation of power plants and lng receiving terminals involves many
risks including the breakdown or failure of generation or
regasification and storage facilities or other equipment or processes

page11

labor disputes fuel interruption and operating performance below
expected levels  in addition weatherrelated incidents and other
natural disasters can disrupt generation regasification and
transmission delivery systems  the occurrence of any of these events
could lead to operation of power plants or lng terminals below their
expected capacity levels which may result in lost revenues or increased
expenses including higher maintenance costs and penalties and could
adversely affect sempra energys business cash flows and results of
operations

competition among developers and operators of lng terminals is rapidly
increasing which may adversely affect the profitability of selngs
proposed lng terminals

although there are only a limited number of lng terminal facilities
operating in north america today many companies have announced plans to
develop lng facilities to serve the north american market  some of
these competitors have more operating experience more development
experience larger staffs and greater financial resources than the
company  industry analysts have predicted that if all of the proposed
lng facilities in north america that have been announced by developers
are actually built there will likely be substantial excess capacity for
such terminals in the near future  excess capacity is likely to lead to
decreased prices for such services  although its proposed lng
facilities in mexico and louisiana are more advanced in the siting
permitting and regulatory approval processes than the proposed projects
of most of its competitors there can be no assurance that sempra energy
will be able to maintain that advantage

sempra energys subsidiaries rely on transmission and distribution
assets that they do not own or control to deliver electricity and
natural gas

sempra energys subsidiaries depend on transmission and distribution
facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the
electricity and natural gas they sell to wholesale markets to supply
some of their electric generation facilities and to provide retail
energy services to customers  selng also will rely on natural gas
transmission facilities to transport natural gas for customers of its
proposed lng terminal facilities  if transmission is disrupted or if
capacity is inadequate the ability of sempra energys subsidiaries to
sell and deliver their products and services may be hindered  as a
result they may be responsible for damages incurred by their customers
such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then
current spot market rates

sempra energys businesses require numerous permits and other
governmental approvals from various federal state local and foreign
governmental agencies and any failure to obtain or maintain required
permits or approvals could cause sempra energys sales to decline andor
its costs to increase

the acquisition ownership and operation of electric generation
facilities natural gas pipelines and lng receiving terminals require
numerous permits approvals and certificates from federal state local
and foreign governmental agencies  all of the existing and planned
development projects of sempra energys subsidiaries require multiple

page12

permits  they may not be able to obtain or maintain all required
regulatory approvals  if there is a delay in obtaining any required
regulatory approvals or if the company fails to obtain any required
approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations it may
not be able to operate its facilities or it may be forced to incur
additional costs

sempra energys future results of operations cash flows and financial
condition may be adversely affected by the outcomes of pending
litigation and other adversarial proceedings involving sempra energy and
some of its subsidiaries including set and ser

lawsuits have been filed by the attorneys general of arizona and nevada
alleging that sempra energy and some of its subsidiaries along with el
paso energy and several of its affiliates unlawfully sought to control
the natural gas markets in their respective states  similar lawsuits
have been filed elsewhere  in addition various lawsuits are pending
against sempra energy set ser and other sempra energy subsidiaries
alleging that the companies unlawfully manipulated the electric energy
market  although the company expects to prevail in these cases it has
expended or accrued substantial amounts to pay the costs of defending
these claims  if the plaintiffs in these cases were to prevail in their
claims sempra energys future results of operations cash flows and
financial condition may be materially adversely affected  these
proceedings are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial
statements and in managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations incorporated by reference in this
report

sempra energys energy and energy trading businesses are subject to
complex government regulations and may be adversely affected by changes
in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation

in recent years the regulatory environment applicable to the electric
power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes both
on a federal and state level which have impacted the nature of these
industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their
businesses  these changes are ongoing and sempra energy cannot predict
the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the
ultimate affect that this changing regulatory environment will have on
its businesses  moreover existing regulations may be revised or
reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become
applicable to the company and its facilities  future changes in laws
and regulations may have a detrimental effect on sempra energys
business cash flows financial condition andor results of operations

sempra energys energy and energy trading operations are subject to
affiliate rules relating to transactions with the california utilities
these businesses could be adversely affected by changes in these rules
or by additional cpuc or ferc rules further restricting their ability
to sell electricity or gas or to trade with the california utilities
affiliate transaction rules also could require these businesses to
obtain the prior approval of the cpuc before entering into any such
transactions with the california utilities  any such restrictions or
approval requirements could adversely affect sers and seis electric
generation plants or natural gas pipelines selngs proposed lng
receiving terminals or set trading operations

page13

various proceedings inquiries and investigations relating to the
business activities of ser and set are currently pending before the
ferc  for a description of such proceedings inquiries and
investigations see the notes to consolidated financial statements and
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations incorporated by reference in this report

sempra energys businesses have significant environmental compliance
costs and future environmental compliance costs could adversely affect
sempra energys profitability

sempra energys subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state
local and foreign statutes rules and regulations relating to
environmental protection  they are required to obtain numerous
governmental permits licenses and other approvals to construct and
operate their businesses  additionally to comply with these legal
requirements they must spend significant sums on environmental
monitoring pollution control equipment and emissions fees the company
also is generally responsible for all onsite liabilities associated
with the environmental condition of its electric generation facilities
and other energy projects which it has acquired or developed regardless
of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown  if
sempra energys subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable
environmental laws they may be subject to penalties fines andor
curtailments of their operations

the scope and extent of any new environmental regulations including
their affects on operations are difficult to predict  in addition
existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and
new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to the
company and its facilities

sempra energys international businesses are exposed to different local
regulatory and business risks and challenges which could have a
material adverse effect on sempra energys financial condition cash
flows and results of operations

sempra energy subsidiaries currently have interests in electricity
generation natural gas transmission and lng terminal projects in
mexico and also have trading marketing and risk management operations
in canada europe and asia  sempra energy international sei also has
electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in argentina chile
and peru  having energy infrastructure projects owning energy assets
and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject the company to
significant political and financial risks which vary by country
including

 changes in foreign laws and regulations including tax and
   environmental laws and regulations
 changes in us laws and regulations including tax and
   environmental laws and regulations related to foreign
   operations
 high rates of inflation
 changes in government policies or personnel
 trade restrictions

page14

 limitations on us company ownership in foreign countries
 permitting and regulatory compliance
 changes in labor supply and labor relations in operations
   outside the united states
 adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals and difficulty
   in enforcing contractual rights in foreign jurisdictions and
 general political economic and business conditions

sempra energys international businesses also are subject to foreign
currency risks  these risks arise from both volatility in foreign
currency exchange rates and devaluations of foreign currencies  in such
cases an appreciation of the us dollar against a local currency could
reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign
subsidiaries  for example the devaluation of the argentine peso
against the us dollar in recent years as well as the argentine
governments unilateral retroactive abrogation of utility agreements
early in 2002 has had a material adverse effect on seis two
unconsolidated subsidiaries in argentina  on september 6 2002 sei
initiated arbitration proceedings under the 1994 bilateral investment
treaty between the united states and argentina for recovery of the
diminution of the value of its investments that has resulted from
argentine governmental actions  sei has claimed damages of at least
258 million these proceedings which are continuing  for a description
of legal proceedings relating to seis business operations in argentina
see the notes to consolidated financial statements incorporated by
reference in this report  while sei believes that it has contracts and
other measures in place to mitigate its most significant foreign
currency exchange risks it has some exposure that is not fully
mitigated

other risks related to the company

sempra energys cash flows ability to pay dividends and ability to meet
its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its
subsidiaries

sempra energy is a holding company and conducts its operations entirely
through its subsidiaries sempra energys california utilities are its
major source of liquidity funding of other business units capital
expenditures is largely dependent on the california utilities paying
sufficient dividends to sempra energy which depends on the sufficiency
of utility earnings and cash flows in excess of utility needs  in
addition sempra energys cash flows ability to meet its obligations to
creditors and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock are
largely dependent upon the earnings of the subsidiaries and the
distribution of such earnings to sempra energy in the form of dividends
the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be
precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances
including as a result of legislation or regulation or in times of
financial distress

natural disasters catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could
materially adversely affect sempra energys business earnings and cash
flows

page15

like other major industrial facilities sempra energys generation
plants including songs electric transmission facilities lng
receiving terminals and storage facilities chartered oil tankers and
natural gas pipelines may be damaged by natural disasters catastrophic
accidents or acts of terrorism any such incidents could result in
severe business disruptions significant decreases in revenues andor
significant additional costs to the company which could have a material
adverse effect on sempra energys earnings and cash flows  given the
nature and location of these facilities any such incidents also could
cause fires leaks explosions spills or other significant damage to
natural resources andor property belonging to third parties or
personal injuries which could lead to significant claims against sempra
energy and its subsidiaries  insurance coverage may become unavailable
for certain of these risks and the insurance proceeds received for any
loss of or damage to any of its facilities or for any loss of or damage
to natural resources or property or personal injuries caused by its
operations may be insufficient to cover the companys losses or
liabilities without materially adversely affecting the companys
financial condition earnings and cash flows

sempra energy could incur significant income tax expense and its results
of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected if the
internal revenues service irs denies or otherwise makes income tax
credits related to its coal and synthetic fuels businesses unusable

sempra energy generates substantial income tax credits as a result of
synthetic fuel operations and affordablehousing investments  these
credits substantially reduce the companys income tax expense

in 2003 the irs questioned the scientific validity of the testing
procedures used to support synthetic fuel credits  the irs has
completed its review of these procedures and resumed issuing letter
rulings based on its previous requirements including one involving
operations owned by sempra energy  however as part of its recently
commenced normal audit program for the company for the period 19982001
the irs has begun auditing the companys synthetic fuel operations  in
addition a us senate subcommittee has initiated an investigation into
income tax credits and sempra energy and other companies are responding
to subcommittee requests regarding their synthetic fuel operations
through december 31 2003 sempra energy has recorded cumulative
synthetic fuel income tax credits of 256 million including 106
million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2003

although sempra energy believes the retroactive disallowance of its
synthetic fuel credits is unlikely any such retroactive disallowance
could result in a significant liability for income tax credits
previously taken  in addition sempra energys use of income tax
credits in the future could be limited by any new irs interpretations or
regulations or by any new income tax legislation

government regulation

the most significant government regulation affecting sempra energy is
that affecting its utility subsidiaries

page16

california utility regulation

the cpuc which consists of five commissioners appointed by the governor
of california for staggered sixyear terms regulates sdges and
socalgas rates and conditions of service sales of securities rate of
return rates of depreciation uniform systems of accounts examination
of records and longterm resource procurement the cpuc conducts
various reviews of utility performance and conducts investigations into
various matters such as deregulation competition and the environment
to determine its future policies the cpuc also regulates the
relationship of utilities with their holding companies and is currently
conducting an investigation into this relationship

the california energy commission cec has discretion over electric
demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories
based upon these forecasts the cec determines the need for additional
energy sources and for conservation programs the cec sponsors
alternativeenergy research and development projects promotes energy
conservation programs and maintains a statewide plan of action in case
of energy shortages in addition the cec certifies powerplant sites
and related facilities within california

the cec conducts a 20year forecast of supply availability and prices
for every market sector consuming natural gas in california  this
forecast includes resource evaluation pipeline capacity needs natural
gas demand and wellhead prices and costs of transportation and
distribution  this analysis is used to support longterm investment
decisions

the nuclear regulatory commission nrc oversees the licensing
construction and operation of nuclear facilities nrc regulations
require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental
aspects of these facilities periodically the nrc requires that newly
developed data and techniques be used to reanalyze the design of a
nuclear power plant and as a result requires plant modifications as a
condition of continued operation in some cases

local regulation

socalgas has natural gas franchises with the 240 legal jurisdictions in
its service territory these franchises allow socalgas to locate
facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas in the
streets and other public places some franchises have fixed terms such
as that for the city of los angeles which expires in 2012 most of the
franchises do not have fixed terms and continue indefinitely the range

page17

of expiration dates for the franchises with definite terms is 2005 to
2048

sdge has electric franchises with the two counties and the 26 cities in
its electric service territory and natural gas franchises with the one
county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory these
franchises allow sdge to locate facilities for the transmission and
distribution of electricity andor natural gas in the streets and other
public places the franchises do not have fixed terms except for the
electric and natural gas franchises with the cities of encinitas 2012
san diego 2021 and coronado 2028 and the natural gas franchises
with the city of escondido 2036 and the county of san diego 2030

subject to regulation as to operations and financial position among
other things its operations are subject to the new york mercantile
exchange the london metals exchange the commodity futures trading
commission the ferc and the national futures association

other subsidiaries are also subject to varying amounts of regulation by
various governments including various states in the united states

licenses and permits

the california utilities obtain a number of permits authorizations and
licenses in connection with the transmission and distribution of natural
gas  in addition sdge obtains a number of permits authorizations and
licenses in connection with the transmission and distribution of
electricity both require periodic renewal which results in continuing
regulation by the granting agency

the companys unregulated affiliates are also required to obtain
permits authorizations and licenses in the normal course of business
some of these permits authorizations and licenses require periodic
renewal  ser and its subsidiaries obtain a number of permits
authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and

customers

for regulatory purposes customers are separated into core and noncore
customers core customers are primarily residential and small commercial
and industrial customers without alternative fuel capability noncore
customers consist primarily of electric generation eg wholesale
large commercial industrial and enhanced oil recovery customers

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from the california
utilities core customers are permitted to aggregate their natural gas
requirement and purchase directly from brokers or producers the
california utilities continue to be obligated to purchase reliable
supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of the core customers

natural gas procurement and transportation

most of the natural gas purchased and delivered by the california
utilities is produced outside of california primarily in the
southwestern us and canada the california utilities purchase natural
gas under shortterm contracts primarily based on monthly spotmarket
prices

to ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to the distribution
system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers socalgas
is committed to firm pipeline capacity contracts that require the
payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation

page19

entitlements socalgas releases and brokers excess capacity on a short
term basis interstate pipeline companies primarily el paso natural gas
company and transwestern pipeline company provide transportation
services into socalgas intrastate transmission system for supplies
purchased by socalgas or its transportation customers from outside of
california the last of these contracts expires in 2007  the rates that
interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and
transportation services are regulated by the ferc

sdge also has longterm natural gas transportation contracts with
various interstate pipelines which expire on various dates through 2023
sdge currently purchases natural gas on a spot basis to fill its long
term pipeline capacity and purchases additional spot market supplies
delivered directly to california for its remaining requirements sdge
continues to evaluate its longterm pipeline capacity portfolio
including the release of a portion of this capacity to third parties
all of sdges natural gas is delivered through socalgas pipelines under
a shortterm transportation agreement authorized by the cpuc  in
addition under a separate agreement expiring march 2005 socalgas
provides sdge 8 bcf of storage inventory capacity with firm injection
and withdrawal rights

according to btus daily gas wire the annual average spot price of
natural gas at the californiaarizona border was 510 per million
british thermal unit mmbtu in 2003 559 in december 2003 compared
with 314 per mmbtu in 2002 and 727 per mmbtu in 2001 a number of
factors associated with californias energy crisis from late 2000
through early 2001 resulted in higher natural gas prices during that
period prices for natural gas decreased in the later part of 2001 and
increased toward the end of 2002 and in 2003  the following table
summarizes the average commodity costs of natural gas sold for the last
three years which are above previous levels

natural gas storage

socalgas provides natural gas storage services for use by the core
noncore and offsystem customers core customers are allocated a portion
of socalgas storage capacity remaining customers can bid and negotiate
the desired amount of storage on a contract basis the storage service
program provides opportunities for customers to store natural gas
usually during the summer to reduce winter purchases when natural gas
costs are generally higher this allows customers to select the level of

service they desire to assist them to manage their fuel procurement and
transportation needs

demand for natural gas

the california utilities face competition in the residential and
commercial customer markets based on the customers preferences for
natural gas compared with other energy products  the demand for natural
gas by electric generators is influenced by a number of factors  in the
shortterm natural gas use by egs is impacted by the availability of
alternative sources of generation  the availability of hydroelectricity
is highly dependent on precipitation in the western united states  in
addition natural gas use is impacted by the performance of other
generation sources in the western united states including nuclear and
coal and other natural gas facilities outside the service area
natural gas use is also impacted by changes in enduse electricity
demand  for example natural gas use generally increases during summer
heat waves over the longterm natural gas use will be greatly
influenced by additional factors such as the location of new power plant
construction  more generation capacity currently is being constructed
outside southern california than within the utility service area  this
new generation will likely displace the output of older less efficient
local generation reducing eg natural gas use

effective march 31 1998 electric industry restructuring provided out
ofstate producers the option to purchase energy for california utility
customers as a result natural gas demand for electric generation
within southern california competes with electric power generated
throughout the western united states although electric industry
restructuring has no direct impact on the california utilities natural
gas operations future volumes of natural gas transported for electric
generating plant customers may be significantly affected to the extent
that regulatory changes divert electric generation from the california
utilities service area

growth in the natural gas markets is largely dependent upon the health
and expansion of the southern california economy and prices of other
energy products  external factors such as weather the price of
electricity electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power
competing pipelines and general economic conditions can result in
significant shifts in demand and market price the california utilities
added 83000 and 75000 new customer meters in 2003 and 2002
respectively representing growth rates of 14 percent and 12 percent
respectively the california utilities expect that their growth rate for
2004 will approximate that for 2003

in the interruptible industrial market customers are capable of burning
a fuel other than natural gas  fuel oil is the most significant
competing energy alternative  the companys ability to maintain its
industrial market share is largely dependent on price  the relationship
between natural gas supply and demand has the greatest impact on the
price of the companys product  with the reduction of natural gas
production from domestic sources the cost of natural gas from non
domestic sources may play a greater role in the companys competitive
position in the future  the price of oil depends upon a number of
factors beyond the companys control including the relationship between
supply and demand and policies of foreign and domestic governments

page21

the natural gas distribution business is seasonal in nature as
variations in weather conditions generally result in greater revenues
during the winter months when temperatures are colder  as is prevalent
in the industry the company injects natural gas into storage during the
summer months usually april through october for withdrawal storage
during the winter months usually november through march when customer
demand is higher

in december 2003 in connection with plans to develop energia costa
azul an lng receiving terminal in baja california on the west coast of
mexico 50 miles south of san diego selng and shell international gas
limited shell announced plans to form a 5050 joint venture to build
own and operate the 600 million facility  the terminal would be
capable of supplying 1 billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas per day
shell and selng would share the investment costs of the terminal equally
and each would take 50 percent of the capacity in the terminal 500
million cubic feet per day of natural gas from the terminal would be
used to meet the growing energy demands in western mexico  any surplus
gas from the facility would be used to provide new natural gas supplies
for the southwestern united states the proposed joint venture would
combine the two separate baja california lng receiving terminals
proposed by shell and selng into a single project significantly
reducing the impact on the local environment it is expected that
construction would begin in 2004 with terminal operations commencing in
2007

in connection with this project mexicos national environmental agency
issued an environmental permit in april 2003 three other significant

hazardous substances

in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative memorandum
account allowing californias ious to recover their hazardous waste
cleanup costs including those related to superfund sites or similar
sites requiring cleanup recovery of 90 percent of hazardous waste
cleanup costs and related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of
the related insurancelitigation expenses is permitted in addition the
company has the opportunity to retain a percentage of any insurance
recoveries to offset the 10 percent of costs not recovered in rates
cleanup costs at sites related to electric generation were specifically
excluded from the collaborative by the cpuc

during the early 1900s the california utilities and their predecessors
manufactured gas from coal or oil the manufacturedgas plants mgps
often have become contaminated with the hazardous residues of the
process socalgas has identified 42 such sites at which it together
with other users as to 21 of these sites may have cleanup obligations
preliminary investigations at a minimum have been completed on 41 of

page28

the sites as of december 31 2003 26 of these sites have been
remediated of which 20 have received certification from the california
environmental protection agency at december 31 2003 socalgas
estimated remaining investigation and remediation liability for the mgps
is 429 million sdge identified three former mgps remediation of
which was completed at two of the sites in 1998 and 2000 closure
letters have been received for the two sites at december 31 2003
estimated remaining remediation liability on the third site is 58
million

sdge sold its fossilfuel generating facilities in 1999 as a part of
its due diligence for the sale sdge conducted a thorough environmental
assessment of the facilities pursuant to the sale agreements for such
facilities sdge and the buyers have apportioned responsibility for
such environmental conditions generally based on contamination existing
at the time of transfer and the cleanup level necessary for the
continued use of the sites as industrial sites while the sites are
relatively clean the assessments identified some instances of
significant contamination principally resulting from hydrocarbon
releases for which sdge has a cleanup obligation under the agreement
total costs to perform the necessary remediation were estimated at 11
million at the time of sale these costs were offset against the sales
price for the facilities together with other appropriate costs and the
remaining net proceeds were included in the calculation of customer
rates remediation of the plants commenced in early 2001 during 2002
cleanup was completed at several minor sites at a cost of 04 million
in late 2002 additional assessments were started at the primary sites
where cleanup commenced in 2003 and is expected to be completed by 2005
in 2003 at a cost of 08 million cleanup was completed at the site of
a power plant that was sold in 1999 remaining costs to remediate these
sites are estimated at 8 million at december 31 2003

the california utilities lawfully dispose of wastes at permitted
facilities owned and operated by other entities operations at these
facilities may result in actual or threatened risks to the environment
or public health under california law businesses that arrange for
legal disposal of wastes at a permitted facility from which wastes are
later released or threaten to be released can be held financially
responsible for corrective actions at the facility

the company and certain subsidiaries are currently named as potentially
responsible parties prps for one landfill site and two industrial
waste disposal sites from which releases have occurred as described
below

at december 31 2003 the companys estimated remaining investigation
and remediation liability related to hazardous waste sites including
the mgps was 506 million of which 90 percent is authorized to be
recovered through the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism this
estimated cost excludes remediation costs associated with sdges former
fossilfuel power plants the company believes that any costs not
ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will not
have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of
operations or financial position

estimated liabilities for environmental remediation are recorded when
amounts are probable and estimable amounts authorized to be recovered

electric and magnetic fields emfs

although scientists continue to research the possibility that exposure
to emfs causes adverse health effects science has not demonstrated a
causeandeffect relationship between exposure to the type of emfs
emitted by power lines and other electrical facilities and adverse
health effects some laboratory studies suggest that such exposure
creates biological effects but those effects have not been shown to be
harmful the studies that have most concerned the public are
epidemiological studies some of which have reported a weak correlation
between the proximity of homes to certain power lines and equipment and
childhood leukemia other epidemiological studies found no correlation
between estimated exposure and any disease scientists cannot explain
why some studies using estimates of past exposure report correlations
between estimated emf levels and disease while others do not

to respond to public concerns the cpuc has directed california ious to
adopt a lowcost emfreduction policy that requires reasonable design
changes to achieve noticeable reduction of emf levels that are
anticipated from new projects however consistent with the major
scientific reviews of the available research literature the cpuc has
indicated that no health risk has been identified

air and water quality

californias air quality standards are more restrictive than federal
standards however as a result of the sale of the companys fossilfuel
generating facilities the companys primary airquality issue
compliance with these standards now has less significance to the
companys operation although that could change as ser owns and operates
more generating facilities

the transmission and distribution of natural gas require the operation
of compressor stations which are subject to increasingly stringent air
quality standards costs to comply with these standards are recovered in
rates

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the
other owners of songs previously reached agreement with the california
coastal commission to mitigate the environmental damage to the marine
environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs units 2
and 3 this mitigation program includes an enhanced fishprotection
system a 150acre artificial kelp reef and restoration of 150 acres of
coastal wetlands in addition the owners must deposit 36 million with
the state for the enhancement of fish hatchery programs and pay for
monitoring and oversight of the mitigation projects sdges share of
the cost is estimated to be 340 million these mitigation projects are
expected to be completed in 2007 through december 31 2003 songs
mitigation costs were recovered through the icip mechanism  songs
mitigation costs incurred after december 31 2003 will be capitalized
and recovered from ratepayers over the remaining life of the songs
units subject to cpuc approval in edisons general rate case
additional information on songs cost recovery is provided in note 13 of

sdge also transports natural gas to approximately 300 customers who
procure the natural gas from other sources

supplies of natural gas

the california utilities buy natural gas under several shortterm and
longterm contracts shortterm purchases are from various southwest
united states and canadian suppliers and are primarily based on monthly
spotmarket prices the california utilities transport natural gas
under longterm firm pipeline capacity agreements that provide for
annual reservation charges which are recovered in rates socalgas has
commitments for firm pipeline capacity under contracts with pipeline
companies that expire at various dates through 2006 sdge has long

expires in august 2003 and in which the delivered cost is tied to the
california border spotmarket price sdge purchases natural gas on a
spot basis to fill its additional longterm pipeline capacity sdge
intends to continue using the longterm pipeline capacity in other ways
as well including the transport of other natural gas for its own use
and the release of a portion of this capacity to third parties

most of the natural gas purchased and delivered by the company is
produced outside of california these supplies are delivered to the
companys intrastate transmission system by interstate pipeline
companies primarily el paso natural gas company and transwestern
natural gas company these interstate companies provide transportation
services for supplies purchased from other sources by the company or
its transportation customers the rates that interstate pipeline
companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services are

marketsensitive natural gas supplies supplies purchased on the spot
market as well as under longerterm contracts ranging from one month
to two years based on spot prices accounted for 100 percent of total
natural gas volumes purchased by the company the annual average price
of natural gas at the californiaarizona border was 314million
british thermal units mmbtu in 2002 compared with 727mmbtu in
2001 and 625mmbtu in 2000 supplydemand imbalances and a number of
other factors associated with californias energy crisis from late 2000
through early 2001 resulted in higher natural gas prices during that
period  prices for natural gas decreased in the later part of 2001 and
increased toward the end of 2002  as of december 31 2002 the average
spot cash price at the californiaarizona border was 447mmbtu  the
cost of gas purchased may vary and can exceed the annual average price

during 2002 the california utilities delivered 982 billion cubic feet
bcf of natural gas approximately 59 percent of these deliveries were
customerowned natural gas for which the california utilities provided
transportation services the remaining natural gas deliveries were
purchased by the california utilities and resold to customers

customers

for regulatory purposes customers are separated into core and noncore
customers core customers are primarily residential and small
commercial and industrial customers without alternative fuel
capability noncore customers consist primarily of ueg wholesale
large commercial industrial and offsystem outside the companys
normal service territory customers of the 61 million meters in the
california utilities service territories only 1400 serve the noncore
market

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from the california
utilities core customers are permitted to aggregate their natural gas
requirement and for up to 10 percent of each companys core market to
purchase natural gas directly from brokers or producers  the cpuc
tentatively authorized the removal of the 10 percent limit but this
has yet to be implemented  the california utilities continue to be
obligated to purchase reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the
requirements of its core customers in early 2002 the california
utilities filed an application with the cpuc to combine their core
procurement portfolios on august 22 2002 the cpuc issued an interim
decision denying the request pending completion of the cpucs ongoing
investigation of market power issues

the cpuc ordered that utility procurement services offered to noncore
customers be phased out sometime in 2003  noncore customers would have
the option to either become core customers and continue to receive
utility procurement services or remain noncore customers and purchase
their natural gas from other sources such as brokers or producers
noncore customers would also have to make arrangements to deliver their
purchases to the california utilities receipt points for delivery
through the california utilities transmission and distribution system
the proposed implementation of the order has encountered significant
opposition and the cpuc is reconsidering its decision

in 2002 for socalgas 85 percent of the cpucauthorized natural gas
margin was allocated to the core customers with 15 percent allocated
to the noncore customers in 2002 for sdge 89 percent of the cpuc
authorized natural gas margin was allocated to the core customers with
11 percent allocated to the noncore customers

although revenues from transportation throughput is less than for
natural gas sales the california utilities generally earn the same
margin whether they buy the natural gas and sell it to the customer or
transport natural gas already owned by the customer

socalgas also provides natural gas storage services for noncore and
offsystem customers on a bid and negotiated contract basis the
storage service program provides opportunities for customers to store
natural gas on an as available basis usually during the summer to
reduce winter purchases when natural gas costs are generally higher as
of december 31 2002 socalgas was storing approximately 34 bcf of
customerowned gas

demand for natural gas

natural gas is a principal energy source for residential commercial
industrial and ueg plant customers natural gas competes with
electricity for residential and commercial cooking water heating
space heating and clothes drying and with other fuels for large
industrial commercial and ueg uses growth in the natural gas markets
is largely dependent upon the health and expansion of the southern
california economy the california utilities added 75000 and 71000
new customer meters in 2002 and 2001 respectively representing a
growth rate of 12 percent in both years the california utilities
expect that their growth rate for 2003 will approximate that of 2002

during 2002 99 percent of residential energy customers in socalgas
service area used natural gas for water heating 96 percent for space
heating 76 percent for cooking and 55 percent for clothes drying in
sdges service area 90 percent of residential energy customers used
natural gas for water heating 73 percent for space heating 54 percent
for cooking and 38 percent for clothes drying

demand for natural gas by noncore customers is very sensitive to the
price of competing fuels although the number of noncore customers in
2002 was only 1400 they accounted for approximately 7 percent of the
authorized natural gas revenues and 58 percent of total natural gas
volumes external factors such as weather the price of electricity
electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power competing
pipelines and general economic conditions can result in significant
shifts in demand and market price the demand for natural gas by large
ueg customers is also greatly affected by the price and availability of
electric power generated in other areas

effective march 31 1998 electric industry restructuring gave
california electric utilities the option of purchasing energy for their
customers from outofstate producers as a result natural gas demand
for electric generation within southern california competes with
electric power generated throughout the western united states although
electric industry restructuring has no direct impact on the california
utilities natural gas operations future volumes of natural gas
transported for electric generating plant customers may be
significantly affected to the extent that regulatory changes divert
electricity generation from the california utilities service area

other

the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 which became public law on
december 17 2002 requires that baseline inspections be completed over
a tenyear period with 50 percent of the inspections complete at the
end of five years related to these inspections and potential
retrofits the company estimates that it will have 33 million in
operating and maintenance expense each year and 23 million in capital
expenditures

electric operations

resource planning

in 1996 california enacted legislation restructuring californias
investorowned electric utility industry the legislation and related
decisions of the cpuc were intended to stimulate competition and
reduce rates

supplydemand imbalances and a number of factors resulted in
abnormally high wholesale electric prices beginning in mid2000 which
caused sdges monthly customer bills to be substantially higher than
normal these conditions and the resultant abnormally high electric
commodity prices continued into 2001 resulting in growth of the
undercollection of sdges electricity costs

in response to these high commodity prices the california legislature
adopted legislation intended to stabilize the california electric
utility industry and reduce wholesale electric commodity prices this
resulted in several legislative and regulatory responses including
california assembly bill ab 265 enacted in september 2000 and in
effect through december 31 2002 ab 265 imposed a ceiling of 65
centskilowatt hour kwh on the cost of the electric commodity that
sdge could pass on to its smallusage customers on a current basis
effective retroactive to june 1 2000 further actions included the
dwrs purchasing through december 31 2002 the net short position of
sdge the power needed by sdges customers other than that provided
by sdges nuclear generating facilities or its previously existing
purchase power contracts in addition implementation of some of the
provisions of the memorandum of understanding mou entered into by
representatives of california governor davis the dwr sempra energy
and sdge resulted in the cessation of growth in the ab 265
undercollection

electric resources

in connection with californias electricindustry restructuring
beginning march 31 1998 the california ious were obligated to bid
their power supply including owned generation and purchasedpower
contracts into the px the ious also were obligated to purchase from
the px the power that they sell to their customers in 1999 sdge
completed divestiture of its owned generation other than nuclear an
independent system operator iso schedules power transactions and
access to the transmission system as discussed in note 13 of the
notes to consolidated financial statements due to the conditions in
the california electric utility industry the px suspended its trading
operations on january 31 2001

as discussed above the california legislature passed laws eg
assembly bill x1 in february 2001 authorizing the dwr to enter into
longterm contracts to purchase the portion of power used by sdge
customers that is not provided by sdges existing supply through
december 31 2002  sdges residual net short requirements have been
met by the dwr since february 7 2001

in august 2002 sdge was granted authority by the cpuc to once again
procure electric power to meet the load requirements of its customers
effective january 1 2003  the california legislature also passed
several laws eg ab 57 senate bill sb 1078 and sb 1038 which
required that a purchases made by sdge beginning january 1 2003
not be subject to hindsight regulatory review except for contract
administration functions and b sdge procure at least one percent of
its annual retail energy supply from renewable producers each iou is
directed to procure from renewable sources at least one percent of its
2003 total energy sales and add at least one percent of energy sales
each year thereafter such that a 20percent renewable resources
portfolio is achieved by the year 2017

on september 20 2002 sdge issued a request for offer seeking to
purchase a variety of energy products from both renewable and non
renewable entities  sdge did not enter into any contracts with non
renewable entities but did enter into contracts with 11 renewable
suppliers for 15 projects for 237 megawatts mw of nonfirm power
starting in 2003  on december 5 2002 the cpuc issued its resolution
approving sdges renewable contract purchases and on december 19
2003 the cpuc approved sdges 2003 procurement plan sdge has
contracted to procure approximately four percent of its 2003 total
energy sales from renewable sources and pursuant to the december 2002
cpuc resolution may credit toward future years compliance any excess
over its onepercent requirement

the cpuc also allocated to sdge seven of the contracts signed by the
dwr during the energy crisis in 2001  the contracts represent 2754
mw of capacity available to sdge in a combination of musttake and
dispatchable resources  sdge will be responsible for scheduling and
dispatching these contracts where applicable as well as some
contract administration duties

has resulted in modification to the general rate case and certain other
regulatory proceedings for the california utilities under pbr
regulators require future income potential to be tied to achieving or
exceeding specific performance and productivity goals rather than
relying solely on expanding utility plant to increase earnings the
three areas that are eligible for pbr rewards are operational
incentives based on measurements of safety reliability and customer
satisfaction demandside management dsm rewards based on the
effectiveness of the programs and natural gas procurement rewards

environmental matters

discussions about environmental issues affecting the company are
included in note 15 of the 2002 annual report to shareholders which is
incorporated by reference the following additional information should
be read in conjunction with those discussions

hazardous substances

in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative memorandum
account allowing californias ious to recover their hazardous waste
cleanup costs including those related to superfund sites or similar
sites requiring cleanup cleanup costs at sites related to electric
generation were specifically excluded from the collaborative by the
cpuc recovery of 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and
related thirdparty litigation costs and 70 percent of the related
insurancelitigation expenses is permitted in addition the company
has the opportunity to retain a percentage of any insurance recoveries
to offset the 10 percent of costs not recovered in rates

during the early 1900s the california utilities and their predecessors
manufactured gas from coal or oil the manufacturing sites often have
become contaminated with the hazardous residual byproducts of the
process socalgas has identified 42 such sites at which it together
with other users as to 21 of these sites may have cleanup obligations
preliminary investigations at a minimum have been completed on 41 of
the sites as of december 31 2002 22 of these sites have been
remediated of which 18 have received certification from the california
environmental protection agency epa at december 31 2002 socalgas
estimated remaining investigation and remediation liability for all of
these sites is 43 million sdge identified three former manufactured
gas plant sites remediation of which was completed at two of the sites
in 1998 and 2000 closure letters have been received for the two sites
at december 31 2002 estimated remaining remediation liability on the
third site is 15 million

sdge sold its fossilfuel generating facilities in 1999 as a part of
its due diligence for the sale sdge conducted a thorough
environmental assessment of the facilities pursuant to the sale
agreements for such facilities sdge and the buyers have apportioned
responsibility for such environmental conditions generally based on
contamination existing at the time of transfer and the cleanup level
necessary for the continued use of the sites as industrial sites while
the sites are relatively clean the assessments identified some
instances of significant contamination principally resulting from
hydrocarbon releases for which sdge has a cleanup obligation under
the agreement estimated costs to perform the necessary remediation are
11 million these costs were offset against the sales price for the
facilities together with other appropriate costs and the remaining

net proceeds were included in the calculation of customer rates
remediation of the plants commenced in early 2001 during 2002 cleanup
was completed at several minor sites at a cost of 04 million in late
2002 additional assessments were started at the primary sites where
cleanup in expected to commence by the end of 2003 and be completed by
2005

the california utilities lawfully dispose of wastes at permitted
facilities owned and operated by other entities operations at these
facilities may result in actual or threatened risks to the environment
or public health under california law businesses that arrange for
legal disposal of wastes at a permitted facility from which wastes are
later released or threaten to be released can be held financially
responsible for corrective actions at the facility

the company and certain subsidiaries have been named as potentially
responsible parties prps for two landfill sites and six industrial
waste disposal sites from which releases have occurred

remedial actions and negotiations with other prps and the united states
epa have been in progress since 1986 and 1993 for the two landfill
sites the companys share of costs to remediate these sites is
estimated to be 07 million for the first site and 104 million for
the second site since 1987 119 million has been spent 65 million
in 2002 including 64 million for two consent decrees to settle and
liquidate all remaining liabilities at the second site

at december 31 2002 the companys estimated remaining investigation
and remediation liability related to hazardous waste sites including
the manufactured gas sites was 456 million of which 90 percent is
authorized to be recovered through the hazardous waste collaborative
mechanism this estimated cost excludes remediation costs associated
with sdges former fossilfuel power plants the company believes that
any costs not ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other
means will not have a material adverse effect on the companys
consolidated results of operations or financial position

estimated liabilities for environmental remediation are recorded when
amounts are probable and estimable amounts authorized to be recovered
in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative mechanism are recorded
as a regulatory asset

electric and magnetic fields emfs

although scientists continue to research the possibility that exposure
to emfs causes adverse health effects science has not demonstrated a
causeandeffect relationship between exposure to the type of emfs
emitted by power lines and other electrical facilities and adverse
health effects some laboratory studies suggest that such exposure
creates biological effects but those effects have not been shown to be
harmful the studies that have most concerned the public are
epidemiological studies some of which have reported a weak correlation
between the proximity of homes to certain power lines and equipment and
childhood leukemia other epidemiological studies found no correlation
between estimated exposure and any disease scientists cannot explain
why some studies using estimates of past exposure report correlations
between estimated emf levels and disease while others do not

23
page

to respond to public concerns the cpuc has directed california ious to
adopt a lowcost emfreduction policy that requires reasonable design
changes to achieve noticeable reduction of emf levels that are
anticipated from new projects however consistent with the major
scientific reviews of the available research literature the cpuc has
indicated that no health risk has been identified

air and water quality

californias air quality standards are more restrictive than federal
standards however as a result of the sale of the companys fossil
fuel generating facilities the companys primary airquality issue
compliance with these standards now has less significance to the
companys operation although that will change as ser constructs more
generating facilities

the transmission and distribution of natural gas require the operation
of compressor stations which are subject to increasingly stringent
airquality standards costs to comply with these standards are
recovered in rates

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the
other owners of songs reached agreement with the california coastal
commission to mitigate the environmental damage to the marine
environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs units
2 and 3 this mitigation program includes an enhanced fishprotection
system a 150acre artificial reef and restoration of 150 acres of
coastal wetlands in addition the owners must deposit 36 million
with the state for the enhancement of fish hatchery programs and pay
for monitoring and oversight of the mitigation projects sdges share
of the cost is estimated to be 348 million these mitigation projects
are expected to be completed by 2007 through december 31 2003 songs
mitigation costs are recovered through the incremental cost incentive
pricing mechanism costs thereafter are anticipated to be recovered in
customer rates

other matters

research development and demonstration rdd

the socalgas rdd portfolio is focused in five major areas operations
utilization systems power generation public interest and
transportation each of these activities provides benefits to customers
and society by providing more costeffective efficient natural gas
equipment with lower emissions increased safety and reduced
environmental mitigation and other operating costs the cpuc has
authorized socalgas to recover its operating costs associated with
rdd socalgas annual rdd costs have averaged 59 million over the
past three years

for 2002 the cpuc authorized sdge to fund 12 million and 40
million for its natural gas and electric rdd programs respectively
which includes 39 million to the cec for its pier public interest
energy research program sdge cofunded several of these projects
with the cec sdges annual rdd costs have averaged 44 million over
the past three years

other subsidiaries are also subject to governmental regulation

local regulation
southern california gas company socalgas has gas franchises with the
239 legal jurisdictions in its service territory these franchises
allow socalgas to locate facilities for the transmission and
distribution of natural gas in the streets and other public places
some franchises have fixed terms such as that for the city of los
angeles which expires in 2012 most of the franchises do not have
fixed terms and continue indefinitely the range of expiration dates
for the franchises with definite terms is 2003 to 2048

san diego gas and electric sdge has electric franchises with the
three counties and the 26 cities and gas franchises with one county
and the 23 cities in its service territory these franchises allow
sdge to locate facilities for the transmission and distribution of
electricity andor natural gas in the streets and other public places
the franchises do not have fixed terms except for the electric and
natural gas franchises with the cities of chula vista 2003
encinitas 2012 san diego 2021 and coronado 2028 and the
natural gas franchises with the city of escondido 2036 and the
county of san diego 2030

california utility regulation
the state of california legislature from time to time passes laws
that regulate sdges and socalgas operations for example in 1996
the legislature passed an electric industry deregulation bill and
then in 2000 and 2001 passed additional bills aimed at addressing
problems in the deregulated electric industry in addition the
legislature enacted a law in 1999 addressing natural gas industry
restructuring

the california public utilities commission cpuc which consists of
five commissioners appointed by the governor of california for
staggered sixyear terms regulates sdges and socalgas rates and
conditions of service sales of securities rate of return rates of
depreciation uniform systems of accounts examination of records and
longterm resource procurement the cpuc also conducts various reviews
of utility performance and conducts investigations into various
matters such as deregulation competition and the environment to
determine its future policies

the california energy commission cec has discretion over electric
demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories
based upon these forecasts the cec determines the need for additional
energy sources and for conservation programs the cec sponsors
alternativeenergy research and development projects promotes energy
conservation programs and maintains a statewide plan of action in
case of energy shortages in addition the cec certifies powerplant
sites and related facilities within california

united states utility regulation
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the
interstate sale and transportation of natural gas the transmission
and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce
transmission access the uniform systems of accounts rates of
depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale

the nuclear regulatory commission nrc oversees the licensing
construction and operation of nuclear facilities nrc regulations
require extensive review of the safety radiological and environmental
aspects of these facilities periodically the nrc requires that newly
developed data and techniques be used to reanalyze the design of a
nuclear power plant and as a result requires plant modifications as
a condition of continued operation in some cases

international utility regulation
the companys consolidated and unconsolidated affiliates have
locations in argentina canada chile mexico peru and uruguay these
operations are subject to the local federal and other regulations of
the countries in which they are located

socalgas and sdge obtain a number of permits authorizations and
licenses in connection with the transmission and distribution of
natural gas in addition sdge obtains a number of permits
authorizations and licenses in connection with the transmission and
distribution of electricity both require periodic renewal which
results in continuing regulation by the granting agency the companys
unregulated affiliates are also required to obtain permits
authorizations and licenses in the normal course of business

other regulatory matters are described in notes 14 and 15 of the 2001
annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference

scale sempra energy international sei operates natural gas
distribution systems in mexico through 60 percent 95 percent and 100
percent ownership of companies operating in mexicali chihuahua and la
laguna durango respectively  sei also has a 10year contract to
deliver up to 300 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to a power
plant in rosarito mexico these north american operations are
included in the following discussion of the companys natural gas
operations sei also has interests in natural gas operations in south
america which are not consolidated and therefore are not included in
these discussions additional information on international operations
is provided in managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations

in december 1999 sempra atlantic gas sag a subsidiary of sei was
awarded a 25year franchise by the provincial government of nova
scotia to build and operate a natural gas distribution system in
september 2001 due to new conditions required by the government of
nova scotia sag notified the government that it intended to surrender
its natural gas distribution franchise

supplies of natural gas
the company buys natural gas under several shortterm and longterm
contracts shortterm purchases are from various southwest us and
canadian suppliers and are primarily based on monthly spotmarket
prices socalgas and sdge transport gas under longterm firm pipeline
capacity agreements that provide for annual reservation charges which
are recovered in rates socalgas has commitments for firm pipeline
capacity under contracts with pipeline companies that expire at
various dates through 2006 sdge has longterm natural gas
transportation contracts with various interstate pipelines which
expire on various dates between 2003 and 2023

most of the natural gas purchased and delivered by the company is
produced outside of california these supplies are delivered to the
companys intrastate transmission system by interstate pipeline
companies primarily el paso natural gas company and transwestern
natural gas company these interstate companies provide transportation
services for supplies purchased from other sources by the company or
its transportation customers the rates that interstate pipeline
companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services are
regulated by the ferc

marketsensitive natural gas supplies supplies purchased on the spot
market as well as under longerterm contracts ranging from one month
to two years based on spot prices accounted for 100 percent of total
natural gas volumes purchased by the company the average price of
natural gas at the californiaarizona border was 727mmbtu in 2001
compared with 625mmbtu in 2000 and 233mmbtu in 1999
supplydemand imbalances and a number of other factors associated with
californias energy crisis in late 2000 and in early 2001 resulted in
higher natural gas prices during that period  prices for natural gas
have subsequently decreased in the later part of 2001  as of december
31 2001 the average spot cash price at the californiaarizona border
was 263mmbtu

during 2001 the california utilities delivered 1131 bcf of natural
gas through their systems approximately 64 percent of these
deliveries were customerowned natural gas for which the california
utilities provided transportation services the remaining natural gas
deliveries were purchased by the california utilities and resold to
customers the california utilities estimate that sufficient natural
gas supplies will be available to meet the requirements of their
customers for the next several years

customers
for regulatory purposes customers are separated into core and noncore
customers core customers are primarily residential and small
commercial and industrial customers without alternative fuel
capability noncore customers consist primarily of utility electric
generation ueg wholesale large commercial industrial and off
system outside the companys normal service territory customers of
the 59 million customer meters in the california utilities service
territories only 1400 serve the noncore market

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from the california
utilities core customers are permitted to aggregate their natural gas
requirement and up to a limit of 10 percent of each companys core
market to purchase natural gas directly from brokers or producers
beginning in 2002 the cpuc authorized the removal of the 10 percent
limit the company continues to be obligated to purchase reliable
supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of its core
customers the california utilities recently filed an application with
the cpuc to combine their core procurement portfolios on march 6
2002 a proposed decision was issued which if approved will allow
sd≥ and socalgas to combine their core procurement portfolios a
final cpuc decision is expected in mid2002

beginning in 2002 utility procurement services offered to noncore
customers will be phased out  noncore customers will have the option
to either become core customers and continue to receive utility
procurement services or remain noncore customers and purchase their
natural from other sources such as brokers or producers  noncore
customers will also have to make arrangements to deliver their
purchases to the california utilities receipt points for delivery
through the california utilities transmission and distribution
system

in 2001 for socalgas 87 percent of the cpucauthorized natural gas
margin was allocated to the core customers with 13 percent allocated
to the noncore customers in 2001 for sdge 89 percent of the cpuc
authorized natural gas margin was allocated to the core customers
with 11 percent allocated to the noncore customers

although revenues from transportation throughput is less than for
natural gas sales the california utilities generally earn the same
margin whether they buy the gas and sell it to the customer or
transport natural gas already owned by the customer

socalgas also provides natural gas storage services for noncore and
offsystem customers on a bid and negotiated contract basis the
storage service program provides opportunities for customers to store
natural gas on an as available basis usually during the summer to
reduce winter purchases when natural gas costs are generally higher
as of december 31 2001 socalgas was storing approximately 35 bcf of
customerowned gas

demand for natural gas
natural gas is a principal energy source for residential commercial
industrial and ueg customers natural gas competes with electricity
for residential and commercial cooking water heating space heating
and clothes drying and with other fuels for large industrial
commercial and ueg uses growth in the naturalgas markets is largely
dependent upon the health and expansion of the southern california
economy the california utilities added approximately 71000 and
82000 new customer meters in 2001 and 2000 respectively
representing growth rates of 12 percent and 14 percent
respectively the california utilities expect that their growth rate
for 2002 will approximate that of 2001

during 2001 99 percent of residential energy customers in socalgas
service area used natural gas for water heating 96 percent for space
heating 76 percent for cooking and 55 percent for clothes drying in
sdges service area 90 percent of residential energy customers used
natural gas for water heating 75 percent for space heating 55
percent for cooking and 40 percent for clothes drying

demand for natural gas by noncore customers is very sensitive to the
price of competing fuels although the number of noncore customers in
2001 was only 1400 they accounted for approximately 8 percent of the
authorized natural gas revenues and 63 percent of total natural gas
volumes external factors such as weather the price of electricity
electric deregulation the use of hydroelectric power competing
pipelines and general economic conditions can result in significant
shifts in demand and market price the demand for natural gas by large
ueg customers is also greatly affected by the price and availability
of electric power generated in other areas

effective march 31 1998 electric industry restructuring gave
california consumers the option of selecting their electric energy
provider from a variety of local and outofstate producers as a
result natural gas demand for electric generation within southern
california competes with electric power generated throughout the
western united states although electric industry restructuring has no
direct impact on the california utilities natural gas operations
future volumes of natural gas transported for electric generating
plant customers may be significantly affected to the extent that
regulatory changes divert electricity generation from the california
utilities service area

electric operations

resource planning
in 1996 california enacted legislation restructuring californias
investorowned electric utility industry the legislation and related
decisions of the cpuc were intended to stimulate competition and
reduce rates beginning on march 31 1998 customers were given the
opportunity to choose to continue to purchase their electricity from
the local utility under regulated tariffs to enter into contracts
with other energy service providers direct access or to buy their
power from the california power exchange px that served as a
wholesale power pool allowing all energy producers to participate
competitively however supplydemand imbalances and a number of
factors resulted in abnormally high wholesale electric prices
beginning in mid2000 which caused sdges monthly customer bills to
be substantially higher than normal these conditions and the
resultant abnormally high electriccommodity prices continued into
2001 in response to these high commodity prices the california
legislature has adopted legislation intended to stabilize the
california electric utility industry and reduce wholesale electric
commodity prices these actions include the california department of
water and resources dwr purchasing the net short position of sdge
the power needed by sdges customers other than that provided by
sdges nuclear generating facilities or its previously existing
purchase power contracts and the memorandum of understanding mou
entered into by representatives of california governor davis the dwr
sempra energy and sdge  subject to cpuc approval the mou
contemplated the implementation of a series of transactions and
regulatory settlements and actions to resolve many of the issues
affecting sdge and its customers arising out of the california energy
crisis

electric resources
in connection with californias electricindustry restructuring
beginning march 31 1998 the california investorowned utilities
ious were obligated to bid their power supply including owned
generation and purchasedpower contracts into the px the ious also
were obligated to purchase from the px the power that they sell in
1999 sdge completed divestiture of its owned generation other than
nuclear an independent system operator iso schedules power
transactions and access to the transmission system as discussed in
note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements due to the
conditions in the california electric utility industry the px
suspended its trading operations on january 31 2001 sdge has been
granted authority by the cpuc to purchase up to 1900 megawatts of
power through bilateral contracts also as discussed above the
california legislature passed laws eg assembly bill 1 in february
2001 authorizing the dwr to enter into longterm contracts to
purchase the portion of power used by sdge customers that is not
provided by sdges existing supply based on generating plants in

sei develops operates and invests in energyinfrastructure systems
sei has interests in natural gas andor electric transmission and
distribution projects in argentina chile mexico peru and the
eastern united states and is pursuing other projects primarily in
mexico

in october 2001 sei and cms energy corporation announced plans to
jointly develop an lng receiving facility on a 300acre site along the
pacific coast near ensenada mexico the joint venture will develop
the 400 million facility and related port infrastructure which will
provide one billion cubic feet per day of natural gas sei has entered
into a memorandum of understanding with a bolivian consortium for the
supply of lng to the facility commercial operation of the facility is
scheduled to begin in late 2005

in june 2000 sei and pge corporation announced an agreement to
construct the north baja pipeline a 230 million 215mile natural
gas pipeline which will extend from arizona to the rosarito pipeline
south of tijuana the agreement calls for sei to construct own and
operate the 135mile segment of the pipeline within mexico and pge
corporation to construct own and operate the 80mile segment within
the united states the 30inch pipeline will deliver 500 million cubic
feet per day of natural gas to new generation facilities in baja
california including sers termoelectrica de mexicali power plant
discussed below sei has begun construction of the pipeline with
completion anticipated in the summer of 2002

in december 1999 sag was awarded a 25year franchise by the
government of nova scotia to build and operate a natural gas
distribution system in september 2001 due to new conditions required
by the government of nova scotia sag notified the government that it
intended to surrender its natural gas distribution franchise sag
recorded an aftertax expense of 25 million related to the surrender
of the franchise

net income for international operations in 2001 was 25 million
compared to net income of 33 million and 2 million for 2000 and
1999 respectively the decrease in net income for 2001 was primarily
due to sags surrender of the natural gas franchise in nova scotia
partially offset by increased earnings at seis latin american
subsidiaries the increase in net income for 2000 was primarily due to
additional investments in south american subsidiaries and improved
operating results at existing south american investments

sempra energy resources ser

ser develops power plants for the competitive market and owns natural
gas storage production and transportation assets ser is planning to
develop 5000 to 10000 megawatts of generation within the next
decade primarily in the southwestern united states

in may 2001 ser entered into a tenyear agreement with the dwr to
supply up to 1900 megawatts of power to the state ser intends to
deliver most of this electricity from its projected portfolio of
plants in the western united states and baja california mexico sales
under the contract comprise more than twothirds of the projected
capacity of these facilities and the profits therefrom are significant
to the companys ability to increase its earnings ser began providing
250 megawatts of discounted summer capacity to the dwr on june 1
2001 this electricity was supplied through market purchases and sers
share of the el dorado generating facility in accordance with the
contract sales to the dwr ceased from october 1 2001 through march
31 2002 the period during which expected demands for energy are
lower due to cooler weather deliveries under the contract are
scheduled to recommence on april 1 2002 without discounting and end
on september 30 2011 subsequent to the states signing of this
contract and electricitysupply contracts with other vendors various
state officials have contended that the rates called for by the
contracts are too high the rates under the ser contract exceed
current spotmarket prices for electricity but are lower than those
prevailing at the time the contract was signed and are reflective of
rates needed to support new plant development there have been
discussions between state representatives and ser and other suppliers
concerning possible renegotiation of the contracts in february 2002
the state requested the federal energy regulatory commission to
determine that the contracts do not provide just and reasonable rates
and to abrogate or reform the contracts the company believes that
sers contract prices are just and reasonable but has offered to
renegotiate certain aspects of the contract which would not affect
the longterm profitability in a manner mutually beneficial to ser
and the state

in february 2001 the company announced plans to construct
termoelectrica de mexicali a 350 million 600megawatt power plant
near mexicali mexico fuel for the plant will be supplied via the
planned pipeline from arizona to tijuana referred to above it is
anticipated that the electricity produced by the plant will be
exported for consumption in the united states via the 230000volt
transmission line which is also under construction construction of
the power plant began in the second half of 2001 with completion
scheduled for mid2003

in december 2000 ser obtained approval from the appropriate state
agencies to construct the mesquite power plant located near phoenix
arizona mesquite power is a 700 million 1200megawatt project which
will provide electricity to wholesale energy markets in the southwest
region ground was broken in march 2001 with project completion
anticipated in 2003 the project is being financed via the synthetic
lease agreement described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements

in december 2000 ser obtained approvals from the appropriate state
agencies to construct the elk hills power project a 410 million 570
megawatt power plant near bakersfield california elk hills is being
developed in joint venture with occidental energy ventures
corporation

in mid2000 el dorado energy a 5050 partnership between ser and
reliant energy power generation completed construction of a 280
million 500megawatt merchant power plant near las vegas nevada

ser recorded a net loss of 27 million in 2001 compared to net income
of 29 million and 5 million in 2000 and 1999 respectively the
decline in results for 2001 was due to the sale of electricity to the
state of california at a discounted price in the first phase of the
longterm contract described above and the successful operations of

a decision adopting provisions affecting the structure of the
natural gas industry in california some of which could introduce
additional volatility into the earnings of the california utilities
and other market participants additional information on natural
gas industry restructuring is provided in managements discussion

natural gas and consumption levels for the majority of natural gas
are eliminated through balancing accounts authorized by the cpuc
as a result of californias electric restructuring law
overcollections recorded in the electric balancing accounts were
applied to transition cost recovery and fluctuations in certain
costs and consumption levels can now affect earnings from electric
operations additional information on balancing accounts is

environmental matters

discussions about environmental issues affecting the company are
included in managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations of the 2001 annual report to
shareholders which is incorporated by reference the following
additional information should be read in conjunction with those
discussions

hazardous substances
in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative
memorandum account a mechanism that allows the california
utilities and other utilities to recover in rates the costs
associated with the cleanup of sites contaminated with hazardous
waste in general utilities are allowed to recover 90 percent of
their cleanup costs and any related costs of litigation

during the early 1900s the california utilities and their
predecessors manufactured gas from coal or oil the manufacturing
sites often have become contaminated with the hazardous residual
byproducts of the process socalgas has identified 42 former
manufacturedgas plant sites at which it together with other users
as to 21 of these sites may have cleanup obligations as of
december 31 2001 18 of these sites have been remediated of which
14 have received certification from the california environmental
protection agency preliminary investigations at a minimum have
been completed on 41 of the sites at december 31 2001 socalgas
estimated remaining investigation and remediation liability for all
of these sites is 545 million sdge has identified three former
manufacturedgas plant sites all three sites have been remediated
and closure letters received for all but one of the sites at
december 31 2001 estimated remaining remediation liability on
these sites is less than 02 million

sdge sold its fossilfuel generating facilities in 1999 as a part of
its due diligence for the sale sdge conducted a thorough
environmental assessment of the facilities pursuant to the sale
agreements for such facilities sdge and the buyers have apportioned
responsibility for such environmental conditions generally based on
contamination existing at the time of transfer and the cleanup level
necessary for the continued use of the sites as industrial sites
while the sites are relatively clean the assessments identified some
instances of significant contamination principally resulting from
hydrocarbon releases for which sdge has a cleanup obligation under
the agreement estimated costs to perform the necessary remediation
are 11 million these costs were offset against the sales price for
the facilities together with other appropriate costs and the
remaining net proceeds were included in the calculation of customer
rates remediation of the plants commenced in early 2001 during 2001
cleanup was completed at three minor sites at a cost of 03 million
also during 2001 additional assessments were performed at the primary
sites at a cost of 03 million cleanup completion is expected by the
end of 2002

demolition of the encanto gas holder station began in 2000 the site
taken out of service in 1995 consisted of a compressor building and
over nine miles of 30inch diameter steel pipe used to store gas
contamination issues at the site include asbestos and hydrocarbons
completion of the cleanup is expected in 2002 cleanup expenses
through the end of 2001 were 09 million and remaining expenses
expected to be incurred in 2002 are estimated at 05 million

the california utilities lawfully disposed of wastes at permitted
facilities owned and operated by other entities operations at
these facilities may result in actual or threatened risks to the
environment or public health under california law businesses that
arrange for legal disposal of wastes at a permitted facility from
which wastes are later released or threaten to be released can be
held financially responsible for corrective actions at the
facility

the company and certain subsidiaries have been named as potentially
responsible parties prps for two landfill sites and six
industrial waste disposal sites from which releases have occurred
as described below

remedial actions and negotiations with other prps and the united
states environmental protection agency epa have been in progress
since 1986 and 1993 for the two landfill sites the companys share
of costs to remediate these sites is estimated to be 104 million
07 million for the first site and 97 million for the second
site of this 50 million has been spent since 1987 140000 in
2001 and the company recently signed a consent decree to settle
and liquidate all remaining liabilities at the second site for 57
million

in the early 1990s the company was notified of hazards at two
industrial waste treatment facilities in the california communities
of fresno and carson where the company had disposed of wastes
during 2000 the company settled with the other prps at these sites
for 04 million and has no additional liability

the company and 10 other entities have been named prps by the
department of toxic substance control dtsc as liable for any
required corrective action regarding contamination at an industrial
waste disposal site in pico rivera california dtsc has taken this
action because sdge and others sold used transformers to the
sites owner sdge and the other prps have entered into a cost
sharing agreement to provide funding for the implementation of a
consent order between dtsc and the site owner for the development
of a cleanup plan sdges interim share under the agreement is
101 percent subject to adjustment based on ultimate
responsibility allocations the total estimate for all prps is 3
million to 9 million since inception sdges share of the
cleanup expenses was 02 million including 47000 in 2001

in december 1999 socalgas was notified that it is a prp at a waste
treatment facility in bakersfield california socalgas is working
with other prps in order to remove from the site certain liquid
wastes that threaten to be released socalgas has reserved 08
million in contingent environmental liability for its share of site
cleanup amounts expended to date are 01 million including
11000 in 2001

in march 2000 socalgas was notified it is a prp at a former
mercury recycling facility in brisbane california total potential
liability is estimated at 5900 settlement and payment to the
state of california is expected by mid2002 also in march 2000
socalgas was sued in federal district court as a prp in a waste oil
disposal site in los angeles plaintiffs alleged that socalgas had
transported various petroleum wastes to the site in the 1950s for
recycling socalgas settled with plaintiffs in december 2000 for
02 million

at december 31 2001 the companys estimated remaining
investigation and remediation liability related to hazardous waste
sites including the manufactured gas sites was 57 million of
which 90 percent is authorized to be recovered through the
hazardous waste collaborative mechanism this estimated cost
excludes remediation costs associated with sdges former fossil
fuel power plants the company believes that any costs not
ultimately recovered through rates insurance or other means will
not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated
results of operations or financial position

estimated liabilities for environmental remediation are recorded
when amounts are probable and estimable amounts authorized to be
recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative
mechanism are recorded as a regulatory asset

electric and magnetic fields emfs
although scientists continue to research the possibility that
exposure to emfs causes adverse health effects science has not
demonstrated a causeandeffect relationship between adverse health
effects and exposure to the type of emfs emitted by power lines and
other electrical facilities some laboratory studies suggest that
such exposure creates biological effects but those effects have
not been shown to be harmful the studies that have most concerned
the public are epidemiological studies some of which have reported
a weak correlation between childhood leukemia and the proximity of
homes to certain power lines and equipment other epidemiological
studies found no correlation between estimated exposure and any
disease scientists cannot explain why some studies using estimates
of past exposure report correlations between estimated emf levels
and disease while others do not

to respond to public concerns the cpuc has directed california
utilities to adopt a lowcost emfreduction policy that requires
reasonable design changes to achieve noticeable reduction of emf
levels that are anticipated from new projects however consistent
with the major scientific reviews of the available research
literature the cpuc has indicated that no health risk has been
identified

air and water quality
californias air quality standards are more restrictive than
federal standards however as a result of the sale of the
companys fossilfuel generating facilities the companys primary
airquality issue compliance with these standards now has less
significance to the companys operation although that will change
as ser constructs more generating facilities

the transmission and distribution of natural gas require the
operation of compressor stations which are subject to increasingly
stringent airquality standards costs to comply with these
standards are recovered in rates

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the
other owners of songs reached agreement with the california coastal
commission to mitigate the environmental damage to the marine
environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs units
2 and 3 this mitigation program includes an enhanced fishprotection
system a 150acre artificial reef and restoration of 150 acres of
coastal wetlands in addition the owners must deposit 36 million
with the state for the enhancement of fish hatchery programs and pay
for monitoring and oversight of the mitigation projects sdges share
of the cost is estimated to be 277 million these mitigation
projects are expected to be completed by 2007

other matters

research development and demonstration rdd
the socalgas rdd portfolio is focused in five major areas
operations utilization systems power generation public interest and
transportation each of these activities provides benefits to
customers and society by providing more costeffective efficient
natural gas equipment with lower emissions increased safety and
reduced environmental mitigation and other operating costs the cpuc
has authorized socalgas to recover its operating costs associated with
rdd socalgas annual rdd costs have averaged 75 million over the
past three years

for 2001 the cpuc authorized sdge to fund 12 million and 4
million for its gas and electric rdd programs respectively which
includes 39 million to the cec for its pier public interest energy
research program sdge cofunded several of these projects with the
cec sdges annual rdd costs have averaged 44 million over the
past three years

natural gas operations

the company purchases sells distributes stores and transports
natural gas socalgas owns and operates a natural gas distribution
transmission and storage system that supplies natural gas to its
customers including transport to electric generating plants
throughout a 23000squaremile service territory from central
california to the mexican border sdge purchases and distributes
natural gas to 760000 enduse customers throughout the western
portion of san diego county sdge also transports gas to over 1000
customers who procure their gas from other sources on a smaller
scale sempra energy international sei operates natural gas
distribution systems in mexico through 60 percent 95 percent and 100
percent ownership of dgnmexicali dgnchihuahua and dgnla laguna
durango respectively these north american operations are included
in the following discussion of the companys natural gas operations
sei also has interests in natural gas operations in south america
which are not consolidated and therefore are not included in these
discussions additional information on international operations is
provided in managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations

in december 1999 sempra atlantic gas sag a subsidiary of sei was
awarded a 25year franchise by the provincial government of nova
scotia to build and operate a natural gas distribution system in nova
scotia sag has invested 23 million and plans to invest 700 million
to 800 million over the next seven years to build the system which
will make natural gas available to 78 percent of the 350000
households in nova scotia construction of the system began in the
fourth quarter of 2000 with delivery of natural gas expected to
begin in the second quarter of 2001

supplies of natural gas
the company buys natural gas under several shortterm and longterm
contracts shortterm purchases are from various southwest us and
canadian suppliers and are primarily based on monthly spotmarket
prices socalgas and sdge transport gas under longterm firm
pipeline capacity agreements that provide for annual reservation
charges socalgas and sdge recover such fixed charges in rates
socalgas has firm pipeline capacity contracts with pipeline companies
that expire at various dates through 2006 sdge has longterm
capacity contracts with interstate pipelines which expire at various
dates between 2007 and 2023

most of the natural gas purchased and delivered by the company is
produced outside of california these supplies are delivered to the
companys intrastate transmission system by interstate pipeline
companies primarily el paso natural gas company and transwestern
natural gas company these interstate companies provide
transportation services for supplies purchased from other sources by
the company or its transportation customers the rates that
interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and
transportation services are regulated by the ferc

    fixed charges primarily include pipeline demand charges take or pay settlement costs
     and other directbilled amounts allocated over the quantities delivered by the

marketsensitive natural gas supplies supplies purchased on the
spot market as well as under longerterm contracts ranging from
one month to ten years based on spot prices accounted for 96
percent of total natural gas volumes purchased by the company
during 2000 as compared with 91 percent and 79 percent during 1999
and 1998 respectively supplydemand imbalances have increased the
price of natural gas in california even more than in the rest of
the country because of californias dependence on natural gas fired
electric generation due to airquality considerations the average
price of natural gas at the californiaarizona caaz border was
625mmbtu in 2000 compared with 233mmbtu in 1999 on december
11 2000 the average spot cash gas price at the caaz border
reached a record high of 5691mmbtu

during 2000 the company delivered 1131 bcf of natural gas through
its system approximately 65 percent of these deliveries were
customerowned natural gas for which the company provided
transportation services the remaining natural gas deliveries were
purchased by the company and resold to customers the company
estimates that sufficient natural gas supplies will be available to
meet the requirements of its customers for the next several years

customers
for regulatory purposes customers are separated into core and
noncore customers core customers are primarily residential and
small commercial and industrial customers without alternative fuel
capability noncore customers consist primarily of utility electric
generation ueg wholesale large commercial industrial and off
system outside the companys normal service territory customers
of the 58 million customer meters in the companys service
territory only 1600 serve the noncore market

most core customers purchase natural gas directly from the company
core customers are permitted to aggregate their natural gas
requirement and up to a limit of 10 percent of the companys core
market to purchase natural gas directly from brokers or producers
the company continues to be obligated to purchase reliable supplies
of natural gas to serve the requirements of its core customers
socalgas and sdge recently filed an application with the cpuc to
combine the two companies core procurement portfolios

noncore customers have the option of purchasing natural gas either
from the company or from other sources such as brokers or
producers for delivery through the companys transmission and
distribution system the only natural gas supplies that the company
may offer for sale to noncore customers are the same supplies that
it purchases for its core customers most noncore customers procure
their own natural gas supply

in 2000 for socalgas 87 percent of the cpucauthorized natural
gas margin was allocated to the core customers with 13 percent
allocated to the noncore customers in 2000 for sdge 89 percent
of the cpucauthorized natural gas margin was allocated to the core
customers with 11 percent allocated to the noncore customers

although revenues from transportation throughput is less than for
natural gas sales the company generally earns the same margin
whether the company buys the gas and sells it to the customer or
transports natural gas already owned by the customer

the company also provides natural gas storage services for noncore
and offsystem customers on a bid and negotiated contract basis
the storage service program provides opportunities for customers to
store natural gas on an as available basis usually during the
summer to reduce winter purchases when natural gas costs are
generally higher as of december 31 2000 the company was storing
approximately 2 bcf of customerowned gas

demand for natural gas
natural gas is a principal energy source for residential
commercial industrial and ueg customers natural gas competes with
electricity for residential and commercial cooking water heating
space heating and clothes drying and with other fuels for large
industrial commercial and ueg uses growth in the naturalgas
markets is largely dependent upon the health and expansion of the
southern california economy the california utilities added
approximately 82000 and 101000 new customer meters in 2000 and
1999 respectively representing growth rates of 14 percent and
15 percent respectively the company expects its growth rate for
2001 to be at the 2000 level

8
page

during 2000 99 percent of residential energy customers in
socalgas service area used natural gas for water heating 96
percent for space heating 76 percent for cooking and 55 percent
for clothes drying in sdges service area 91 percent of
residential energy customers used natural gas for water heating 73
percent for space heating 52 percent for cooking and 35 percent
for clothes drying

demand for natural gas by noncore customers is very sensitive to
the price of competing fuels although the number of noncore
customers in 2000 was only 1600 they accounted for approximately
11 percent of the authorized natural gas revenues and 65 percent
of total natural gas volumes external factors such as weather
the price of electricity electric deregulation the use of
hydroelectric power competing pipelines and general economic
conditions can result in significant shifts in demand and market
price the demand for natural gas by large ueg customers is also
greatly affected by the price and availability of electric power
generated in other areas the increase in ueg demand in 2000 was
due to higher demand for electricity and increased use of natural
gas for electric generation a colder 2000  2001 winter and
population growth in california natural gas demand in 1999 for
ueg customer use increased primarily due to higher electric energy
usage in the summer as a result of warmer weather

effective march 31 1998 electric industry restructuring gave
california consumers the option of selecting their electric energy
provider from a variety of local and outofstate producers as a
result natural gas demand for electric generation within southern
california competes with electric power generated throughout the
western united states although electric industry restructuring has
no direct impact on the companys natural gas operations future
volumes of natural gas transported for ueg customers may be
adversely affected to the extent that regulatory changes divert
electricity production from the companys service area

additional information should be read in conjunction with those
discussions

hazardous substances
in 1994 the cpuc approved the hazardous waste collaborative
memorandum account a mechanism that allows socalgas sdge and
other utilities to recover in rates the costs associated with the
cleanup of sites contaminated with hazardous waste in general
utilities are allowed to recover 90 percent of their cleanup costs
and any related costs of litigation in early 1998 the cpuc
modified this mechanism to exclude these costs related to electric
generation activities these costs are now eligible for inclusion
in the competition transition cost recovery process the effect of
this decision is that sdges costs of compliance with
environmental regulations may not be fully recoverable if they
exceed the estimates included in the transaction costs see
electric resources above

during the early 1900s sdge socalgas and their predecessors
manufactured gas from coal or oil the manufacturing sites often
have become contaminated with the hazardous residual byproducts of
the process sdge has identified three former manufacturedgas
plant sites all three sites have been remediated and closure
letters received for two sites at december 31 2000 estimated
remaining remediation liability on these sites is less than
300000 in addition socalgas has identified 42 former
manufacturedgas plant sites at which it together with other users
as to 21 of these sites may have cleanup obligations as of
december 31 2000 18 of these sites have been remediated of which
14 have received certification from the california environmental
protection agency preliminary investigations at a minimum have
been completed on 40 of the sites at december 31 2000 socalgas
estimated remaining investigation and remediation liability for all
of these sites is 576 million

cleanup of sdges station b a steam and electric generating
facility operated in san diego between 1911 and 1993 was completed
during 1999 activities included removal of asbestos and leadbased
paint and the removal or cleanup of other substances the sale of
the facility was completed in december 1999

sdge sold the south bay and encina power plants and 17 combustion
turbines in 1999 sdge conducted a thorough environmental
assessment of the power plants and combustion turbine sites
pursuant to the sale agreements sdge and the buyers have
apportioned responsibility for remediation obligations for
contamination existing on these sites estimated costs to perform
the necessary remediation at all sites are approximately 10
million together with other appropriate costs these costs were
offset against the sales price for the facilities and the remaining
net proceeds were offset against sdges other transition costs
remediation of the plants commenced in early 2001 completion is
expected in mid2001

sdge and socalgas lawfully disposed of wastes at permitted
facilities owned and operated by other entities operations at
these facilities may result in actual or threatened risks to the
environment or public health under california law businesses that
arrange for legal disposal of wastes at a permitted facility from
which wastes are later released or threaten to be released can be
held financially responsible for corrective actions at the
facility

the company and other subsidiaries have been named as potentially
responsible parties prps for two landfill sites and six
industrial waste disposal sites from which releases have occurred
as described below

remedial actions and negotiations with other prps and the united
states environmental protection agency epa have been in progress
since 1986 and 1993 for the two landfill sites the companys share
of costs to remediate these sites is estimated to be 37 million
of which 410000 was incurred during 2000

in the early 1990s the company was notified of hazards at two
industrial waste treatment facilities in the california communities
of fresno and carson where the company had disposed of wastes
during 2000 the company settled with the other prps at these sites
for 425000 and has no additional liability

the company and 10 other entities have been named prps by the
department of toxic substance control dtsc as liable for any
required corrective action regarding contamination at an industrial
waste disposal site in pico rivera california dtsc has taken this
action because sdge and others sold used transformers to the
sites owner sdge and the other prps have entered into a cost
sharing agreement to provide funding for the implementation of a
consent order between dtsc and the site owner for the development
of a cleanup plan sdges interim share under the agreement is
101 percent subject to adjustment based on ultimate
responsibility allocations the total estimate for all prps is 3
million to 9 million for the development of the cleanup plan and
the actual cleanup

in december 1999 socalgas was notified that it is a prp at a waste
treatment facility in bakersfield california socalgas is working
with other prps in order to remove from the site certain liquid
wastes that threaten to be released it is too early to determine
the existence or extent of any prior releases or the companys
potential total liability

21
page

in march 2000 socalgas was notified it is a prp at a former
mercury recycling facility in brisbane california total potential
liability is estimated at less than 10000 also in march 2000
socalgas was sued in federal district court as a prp in a waste oil
disposal site in los angeles plaintiffs alleged that socalgas had
transported various petroleum wastes to the site in the 1950s for
recycling socalgas settled with plaintiffs in december 2000 for
200000

at december 31 2000 the companys estimated remaining
investigation and remediation liability related to hazardous waste
sites including the manufactured gas sites was 59 million of
which 90 percent is authorized to be recovered through the
hazardous waste collaborative mechanism this estimated cost
excludes remediation cost associated with the sale of the electric
generation plants and the 17 combustion turbines the company
believes that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates
insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect
on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial
position

estimated liabilities for environmental remediation are recorded
when amounts are probable and estimable amounts authorized to be
recovered in rates under the hazardous waste collaborative
mechanism are recorded as a regulatory asset

electric and magnetic fields emfs
although scientists continue to research the possibility that
exposure to emfs causes adverse health effects science has not
demonstrated a causeandeffect relationship between adverse health
effects and exposure to the type of emfs emitted by power lines and
other electrical facilities some laboratory studies suggest that
such exposure creates biological effects but those effects have
not been shown to be harmful the studies that have most concerned
the public are epidemiological studies some of which have reported
a weak correlation between childhood leukemia and the proximity of
homes to certain power lines and equipment other epidemiological
studies found no correlation between estimated exposure and any
disease scientists cannot explain why some studies using estimates
of past exposure report correlations between estimated emf levels
and disease while others do not

to respond to public concerns the cpuc has directed california
utilities to adopt a lowcost emfreduction policy that requires
reasonable design changes to achieve noticeable reduction of emf
levels that are anticipated from new projects however consistent
with the major scientific reviews of the available research
literature the cpuc has indicated that no health risk has been
identified

air and water quality
californias air quality standards are more restrictive than
federal standards however as a result of the sale of the
companys fossilfuel power plants and combustion turbines the
companys primary airquality issue compliance with these
standards has less significance to the companys operation

22
page

the transmission and distribution of natural gas require the
operation of compressor stations which are subject to increasingly
stringent airquality standards costs to comply with these
standards are recovered in rates

in connection with the issuance of operating permits sdge and the
other owners of songs reached agreement with the california coastal
commission to mitigate the environmental damage to the marine
environment attributed to the coolingwater discharge from songs
units 2 and 3 this mitigation program includes an enhanced fish
protection system a 150acre artificial reef and restoration of
150 acres of coastal wetlands in addition the owners must deposit
36 million with the state for the enhancement of fish hatchery
programs and pay for monitoring and oversight of the mitigation
projects sdges share of the cost is estimated to be 274
million the pricing structure contained in the cpucs decision
regarding accelerated recovery of songs units 2 and 3 described in
electric resources above is expected to accommodate these added
mitigation costs

other matters

research development and demonstration rdd
the socalgas rdd portfolio is focused in five major areas
operations utilization systems power generation public interest
and transportation each of these activities provides benefits to
customers and society by providing more costeffective efficient
natural gas equipment with lower emissions increased safety and
reduced environmental mitigation and other operating costs the
cpuc has authorized socalgas to recover its operating costs
associated with rdd socalgas annual rdd costs have averaged
79 million over the past three years

for 2000 the cpuc authorized sdge to fund 12 million and 42
million for its gas and electric rdd programs respectively which
includes 39 million to the cec for its pier public interest
energy research program sdge cofunded several of these projects
with the cec annual rdd costs have averaged 45 million over the
past three years
