 item 1a risk factors 

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part i item 2 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

table of contents 

risks related to the global economy and public health crises 

 the company’s results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic political regulatory international trade and other external conditions 

the company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent o f its revenues from outside the united states and accordingly the company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control such as disruptions in financial markets economic downturns government actions impacting international trade agreements imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures inflation government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates or exchange control ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates climate change as well as related environmental and social regulations may negatively impact the company or its customers and suppliers in terms of availability and cost of natural resources sources and supply of energy product demand and manufacturing and the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities in which we operate 

 the company is subject to risks related to public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with the coronavirus covid19 

3m as a global company is impacted by public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with covid19 the outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty in addition public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 such as the imposition of travel restrictions the adoption of remote working an d governmentordered vaccine mandates have impacted and will continue to impact 3m’s operations in these challenging and dynamic circumstances 3m continues to work to protect its employees and the public maintain business continuity and sustain its operations including ensuring the safety and protection of approximately 50000 people who work in our plants and distribution centers across the world many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic covid19 has impacted 3m’s supply chains relative to global demand for products like respirators surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions within individual regions and countries around the world 3m is working with governments distributors and others to prioritize supplies to the most critical customer and public health needs in addition trade barriers export restrictions and other similar measures imposed by national governments also negatively impact the supplies of personal protection equipment including those made by 3m going into t he most needed areas covid19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to 3m some of these covidrelated factors have increased demand for certain 3m products while others have decreased demand from certain end markets or could make it more difficult for 3m to serve customers 3m has received reports of price gouging counterfeiting and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving its n95 respirators has taken legal action in several states and continues to work with state federal and international law enforcement to protect the public and 3 m against those who seek to exploit 3m’s brand and reputation and defraud others furthermore covid19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates for example covid19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which increases the cost of capital and could adversely impact access to capital with increasing vaccinations and as economies start to reopen in certain parts of the world workplace safety for the company and others will increasingly become a focus of concern as part of the return to work process at the company the company could face additional privacy and data security risks in various countries related to the collection of data regarding employees and contractors with respect to covid19 testing temperature checks contact tracing and vaccination status as the pandemic evolves demand for personal protection products such as disposable respirators may decline from prior levels due to the speed and scope with which the covid situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery 3m is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings 

because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approx imately 60 percent of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

table of contents 

risks related to legal and regulatory proceedings 

 the company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals which could adversely impact our results 

as previously reported the company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local state federal primarily the us environmental protection agency epa and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the company collectively known as “pfas” the pfas group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil water temperature chemical and fire resistance as well as electrical insulating properties the strength of the carbonfluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade these characteristics have made pfas critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones tablets and semiconductors they are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes commercial aircraft and lowemissions vehicles also rely on pfas technology pfas compounds are currently manufactured by various companies including 3m and are used in everyday products as science and technology evolve and advance and in response to e volving knowledge and the understanding that pfas compounds had the potential to build up over time 3m announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos globally as a precautionary measure we phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products with most of these activities in the us completed by the end of 2002 phased out products included aqueous film forming foam afff and coatings for food packaging for example 3m currently is defending lawsuits concerning various pfasrelated products and chemistries and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of pfas in a variety of jurisdictions as discussed in note 16 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results for example we recorded a pretax charge of 897 million inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the state of minnesota involving the presence of pfas in the groundwater surface water fish or other aquatic life and sediments in the state governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving pfas could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs civil or criminal proceedings the imposition of fines and penalties or other remedies as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities suspension of their operations switching costs in seeking alternative sources of supply potential customer damage claims due to supply disruptions or otherwise 

 the company’s future results may be affected by various asserted and unasserted legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks including those involving product liability antitrust intellectual property environmental tax the us foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery laws us trade sanctions compliance regulations of the us food and drug administration fda and similar foreign agencies us federal healthcare programrelated laws and regulations including the false claims act antikickback laws the sunshine act or other matters legal compliance risks also include thirdparty risks where the company’s suppliers vendors or channel partners have business practices that are inconsistent with 3m’s supplier responsibility code 3m performance requirements or with legal requirements 

the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from t he company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict although the company maintains general liability insurance the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by or could exceed the applicable insurance coverage various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period in addition negative publicity related to product liability environmental health and safety or other matters referenced above involving the company may negatively impact the company’s reputation for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 16 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements 

risks related to our products and customer preferences 

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences 

demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s 

table of contents 

ability to achieve incentive goals iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products and v changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data 

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market 

this ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

 the company’s future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials energy and labor due to shortages increased demand and wages logistics supply chain interruptions manufacturing site disruptions natural disasters and other disruptive factors 

the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage climate impacts natural and other disasters and other disruptive events or be terminated any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies supply chain disruptions impacting the distribution of products or disruption to key manufacturing sites’ operations due to natural and other disasters or events such as government actions relating to discharge or emission permits or other legal or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

risks related to our business 

 the company employs information technology systems to support its business including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations compromise information belonging to the company or its customers suppliers and employees exposing the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business the company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems some of which are provided hosted or managed by vendors and other third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of businesses additionally the company collects and stores certain data including proprietary business information and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and cybersecurity laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity and business continuity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems patching maintenance and backup of systems and data the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially vulnerable to the security risks of our vendors and thirdparty service providers security breaches damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by threat actors including nationstate actors computer viruses hardware software and system vulnerabilities ransomware service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events the company’s adoption of remote working initially driven by the pandemic may also introduce additional threats or disruptions to our information technology networks and infrastructure despite our cybersecurity measures it is possible for security vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended time period up to and including several years while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience threats and disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure none of them to date has had a material impact to the company any such threats or disruptions could result in legal claims or proceedings disclosures to regulators liability or penalties under privacy laws interference with the company’s operations and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business although the company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results 

the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions including for example the acquisition of acelity inc and its kci subsidiaries a leading global medical technology company future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

 the company’s future results may be affected by its operational execution including scenarios where the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated 

the company’s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma and engages in ongoing global business transformation business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internalexternal service delivery across 3m to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity while allowing 3m to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency this is enabled by the ongoing multiyear phased implementation of an erp system there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized in addition the ability to adapt to business model and other changes and agility to respond to customer needs and service expectations are important which if not done successfully could negatively impact the company’s ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3m’s brand operational challenges including those related to customer service pace of change and productivity improvements could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial conditions and results of operations 

risks related to financial and capital markets and tax matters 

 the companys defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results 

the performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

 change in the company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding 

the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 3m currently has an a1 credit rating with a negative outlook from moody’s investors service and an a credit rating with a negative outlook from standard  poor’s the company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders the addition of further leverage to the company’s capital structure could impact 3m’s credit ratings in the future failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets 

 changes in tax rates laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial results 

the company’s business is subject to taxrelated external conditions such as tax rates tax laws and regulations changing political environments in the us and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination assessment and enforcement approaches in addition changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from us tax reform legislation andor regulations around the world could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings in connection with the base erosion and profit shifting beps integrated framework provided by organization for economic cooperation and development oecd determination of multijurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change due to uncertainty of the regulation changes and other taxrelated factors stated above it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 2 and note 19

critical accounting estimates 

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates 

table of contents 

the company considers the items below to be critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the company senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

legal proceedings 

assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions the company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 450 contingencies  please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure and recording of liabilities related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 16 for additional information about such estimates 

pension and postretirement obligations 

the company applies certain estimates for the discount rates and expected return on plan assets in determining its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations and related net periodic benefit costs the below further describes these estimates note 13 provides the weighted averages of these assumptions as of applicable dates and for respective periods and additional information on how the rates were determined 

discount rate 

the defined benefit pension and postretirement obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date the company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the december 31 measurement date using the yields of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service costs are determined based on durationspecific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows the interest cost calculation is determined by applying durationspecific spot rates to the yearbyyear projected benefit payments the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income changes in expected benefit payment and service cost cash flows as well as ongoing changes in market activity and yields cause these rates to be subject to uncertainty 

using this methodology the company determined discount rates for its plans as follow 



expected return on plan assets 

the expected return on plan assets for the primary us qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan longterm capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2022 is 600 a decrease from 650 in 2021 return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plans is 386 for 2022 compared to 436 for 2021 changes in asset allocation and market performance over time among other factors cause these estimates to be subject to uncertainty 

for the year ended december 31 2021 the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement service cost expense of 503 million and a benefit of 297 million related to all nonservice pension and postretirement net benefit costs after settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other for a total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense of 206 million down from 322 million in 2020 

table of contents 

in 2022 defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately 435 million while nonservice pension and postretirement net benefit costs is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately 250 million for a total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense of 185 million a decrease of approximately 20 million compared to 2021 

the table below summarizes the impact on 2022 pension expense for the us and international pension plans of a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2021 net periodic benefit cost the table assumes all other factors are held constant including the slope of the discount rate yield curves 



goodwill and certain longlived assets 

the company makes certain estimates and judgments in relation to goodwill and certain longlived assets those include considerations made in the valuation of certain acquired identifiable definitelived and indefinitelived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in impairment assessments of goodwill 

acquisition of certain identifiable definitelived and indefinitelived assets 

in conjunction with an acquisition of a business the company records identifiable definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition the corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows associated discount rates used to calculate present value asset life cycles royalty rates and customer retention rates the fair value calculated for indefinitelived intangible assets such as certain tradenames in addition to intangible assets that are definitelived such as patents customer relationships tradenames and other technologybased assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation due to the significant estimates used in determining their fair value as a result the company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price allocation subsequent to the acquisition not to exceed one year after the acquisition date until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized changes in factors that may impact projected future cash flows discount rates customer preferences and other estimates above as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions among other items cause these estimates to be subject to uncertainty 

assessments of goodwill 

as of december 31 2021 3m goodwill totaled approximately 135 billion goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year as further discussed below and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired if future noncash asset impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the goodwill would be impaired 

impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the loss would equal that difference the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization multiples 3m also performs a discounted cash flow analysis for certain reporting units where the market approach indicates additional review is warranted where applicable the discounted cash flow analysis uses projected cash flows that are based on sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors changes in reporting unit earnings comparable company information and expected future cash flows as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions among other factors make these estimates subject to uncertainty 

as described in note 19 effective in the first quarter of 2021 the company changed its business segment reporting for changes that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units the results of which were immaterial in conjunction with the change in segment reporting 3m completed an assessment indicating no resulting goodwill impairment existed the discussion that follows relates 

table of contents 

to the separate fourth quarter 2021 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time 

based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2021 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units as of october 1 2021 3m had 22 primary reporting units with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 94 percent of the goodwill these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions advanced materials display materials and systems electronics materials solutions health information systems industrial adhesives and tapes medical solutions oral care personal safety separation and purification sciences and transportation safety 

3m is a highly integrated enterprise where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses 

3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2022 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

uncertainty in income tax positions 

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 10 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

​ 




 item 1a risk factors 

​ 

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part i item 2 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations”

​ 

risks related to the global economy and public health crises 

​ 

 the company’s results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic political regulatory international trade and other external conditions  

the company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the united states and accordingly the company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control such as disruptions in financial markets economic downturns government actions impacting international trade agreements imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates or exchange control ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates climate change as well as related environmental and social regulations may negatively impact the company or its customers and suppliers in terms of availability and cost of natural resources sources and supply of energy product demand and manufacturing and the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities in which we operate

 the company is subject to risks related to public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with the coronavirus covid19 

3m as a global company is impacted by public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with covid19 the outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty in addition public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working have impacted 3m’s operations in these challenging and dynamic circumstances 3m continues to work to protect its employees and the public maintain business continuity and sustain its operations including ensuring the safety and protection of approximately 50000 people who work in our plants and distribution centers across the world many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic covid19 has impacted 3m’s supply chains relative to global demand for products like respirators surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions even with 3m’s accelerated production at its global facilities combined with capacity from other manufacturers the industrywide challenge is that global demand for n95 and other respirators continues to exceed the industries’ ability to deliver within individual regions and countries around the world 3m is working with governments distributors and others to prioritize supplies to the most critical customer and public health needs 3m’s manufacturing supply chain and distribution protocols have for example been impacted by the need to prioritize rated orders issued by the federal emergency management agency pursuant to the us defense production act in addition trade barriers export restrictions and other similar measures imposed by national governments also negatively impact the supplies of personal protection equipment including those made by 3m going into the most needed areas covid19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to 3m some of these covidrelated factors have increased demand for certain 3m products while others have decreased demand from certain end markets or could make it more difficult for 3m to serve customers 3m has received reports of price gouging counterfeiting and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving its n95 respirators has taken legal action in several states and continues to work with state federal and international law enforcement to protect the public and 3m against those who seek to exploit 3m’s brand and reputation and defraud others furthermore covid19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates for example covid19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which increases the cost of capital and could adversely impact access to capital as economies start to reopen in certain parts of the world workplace safety for the company and others will increasingly become a focus of concern as part of the return to work process at the company the company could face additional privacy and data security risks related to the collection of data regarding employees and contractors with respect to covid19 testing temperature checks and contact tracing due to the speed and scope with which the covid situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery 3m is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings 

because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately 60 percent of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies

risks related to legal and regulatory proceedings 

 the company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals which could adversely impact our results 

as previously reported the company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local state federal primarily the us environmental protection agency epa and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the company collectively known as “pfas” the pfas group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil water temperature chemical and fire resistance as well as electrical insulating properties the strength of the carbonfluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade these characteristics have made pfas critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones tablets and semiconductors they are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes commercial aircraft and lowemissions vehicles also rely on pfas technology pfas compounds are manufactured by various companies including 3m and are used in everyday products as science and technology evolve and advance and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that pfas compounds had the potential to build up over time 3m announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos globally as a precautionary measure we phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products with most of these activities in the us completed by the end of 2002 phased out products included aqueous film forming foam afff and coatings for food packaging for example 3m currently is defending lawsuits concerning various pfasrelated products and chemistries and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of pfas in a variety of jurisdictions as discussed in note 16 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results for example we recorded a pretax charge of 897 million inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the state of minnesota involving the presence of pfas in the groundwater surface water fish or other aquatic life and sediments in the state governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving pfas could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs civil or criminal proceedings the imposition of fines and penalties or other remedies as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities or otherwise

 the company’s future results may be affected by various asserted and unasserted legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks including those involving product liability antitrust intellectual property environmental tax the us foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery laws us trade sanctions compliance regulations of the us food and drug administration fda and similar foreign agencies us federal healthcare programrelated laws and regulations including the false claims act antikickback laws the sunshine act or other matters   legal compliance risks also include thirdparty risks where the company’s suppliers vendors or channel partners have business practices that are inconsistent with 3m’s supplier responsibility code 3m performance requirements or with legal requirements 

the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict although the company maintains general liability insurance the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by or could exceed the applicable insurance coverage various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period in addition negative publicity related to product liability environmental health and safety or other matters referenced above involving the company may negatively impact the company’s reputation for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 16 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements

risks related to our products and customer preferences 

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences  

demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products and v changes in the 

business environment related to disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data 

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market  

this ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful

 the company’s future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions manufacturing site disruptions natural disasters and other disruptive factors  

the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage climate impacts natural and other disasters and other disruptive events or be terminated any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies or disruption to key manufacturing sites’ operations could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company

risks related to our business 

 the company employs information technology systems to support its business including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations compromise information belonging to the company or its customers suppliers and employees exposing the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business the company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems some of which are provided hosted or managed by vendors and other third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of businesses additionally the company collects and stores certain data including proprietary business information and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity and business continuity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems patching maintenance and backup of systems and data the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially vulnerable to the security risks of our vendors and thirdparty service providers security breaches damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by threat actors including nationstate actors computer viruses hardware software and system vulnerabilities ransomware service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events the company’s increased adoption of remote working which was driven by the pandemic may also introduce additional threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure despite our cybersecurity measures it is possible for security vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended time period up to and including several years while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience threats and disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure none of them to date has had a material impact to the company any such threats or disruptions could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws interference with the company’s operations and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business although the company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured

​ 

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results 

the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions including for example the recently completed acquisition of acelity inc and its kci subsidiaries a leading global medical technology company future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies the company 

realigned from five to four business segments effective in april of 2019 to better serve its global customers and markets successful execution of the realignment and the associated adjustments of our portfolio and business operating model as well as other organizational changes will be important to the company’s future results

 the company’s future results may be affected by its operational execution including scenarios where the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated  

the company’s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma and engages in ongoing global business transformation business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internalexternal service delivery across 3m to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity while allowing 3m to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency this is enabled by the ongoing multiyear phased implementation of an erp system there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized in addition the ability to adapt to business model and other changes and agility to respond to customer needs and service expectations are important which if not done successfully could negatively impact the company’s ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3m’s brand operational challenges including those related to customer service pace of change and productivity improvements could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial conditions and results of operations

risks related to financial and capital markets and tax matters 

 the companys defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results  

the performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows

 change in the company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding  

the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 3m currently has an a1 credit rating with a negative outlook from moody’s investors service and an a credit rating with a negative outlook from standard  poor’s the company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders the addition of further leverage to the company’s capital structure could impact 3m’s credit ratings in the future failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets

​ 

 changes in tax rates laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial results  

the company’s business is subject to taxrelated external conditions such as tax rates tax laws and regulations changing political environments in the us and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination assessment and enforcement approaches in addition changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from us tax reform legislation andor regulations around the world could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings in connection with the base erosion and profit shifting beps integrated framework provided by organization for economic cooperation and development oecd determination of multijurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change due to uncertainty of the regulation changes and other taxrelated factors stated above it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements

​ 

3m manages its operations in four operating business segments safety and industrial transportation and electronics health care and consumer from a geographic perspective any references to emea refer to europe middle east and africa on a combined basis

​ 

consideration of covid19 

​ 

3m is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus covid19 the company updated its risk factors with respect to covid19 which can be found in item 1a “risk factors” in this document 

​ 

public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working have impacted 3m’s operations 3m continues to work to protect its employees and the public maintain business continuity and sustain its operations including ensuring the safety and protection of people who work in its plants and distribution centers across the world many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic covid19 has impacted 3m’s supply chains relative to global demand for products like respirators surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions as this situation continues 3m also closely monitors and responds to potential impacts to the company’s broader supply chain associated with other products covid19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to 3m furthermore covid19 has impacted the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growththe company has taken steps to help employees lead safe and productive lives during the outbreak including remote working escalated procedures in factories related to personal safety cleaning and medical screening measures and pandemic leave policies 3m closely monitors how the spread of covid19 is affecting employees and business operations and has preparedness plans to help protect the safety of employees around the world while safely continuing business while nearly all of our manufacturing locations and distribution centers are fully or partially operational the company 

implemented plant andor line shutdowns during 2020 related to certain markets due to weaker customer demand or government mandates some of the above factors have increased the demand for 3m products while others have decreased demand or made it more difficult for 3m to serve customers serving 3m customers is a priority and teams continue to communicate with individual customers about potential disruptions 

​ 

3m’s total sales increased 01 for the full year 2020 when compared to 2019 organic localcurrency sales decreased 17 for the full year 2020 when compared to 2019 given the diversity of 3m’s businesses the impact of covid19 varied across the company throughout 2020 3m experienced strong sales growth in personal safety as well as in other areas such as home improvement general cleaning semiconductor data center and biopharma filtration covidrelated respirator sales are estimated to have impacted yearonyear organic localcurrency sales growth by approximately 3 percent for the year ending december 31 2020 at the same time weakness in several end markets while improving contributed in part to sales declines in a number of 3m’s businesses with the biggest yearonyear total sales decreases in oral care down 19 percent advanced materials down 17 percent automotive and aerospace down 16 percent commercial solutions down 14 percent stationery and office down 11 percent closure and masking down 11 percent automotive aftermarket down 10 percent and businesses aligned to general industrial applications such as abrasives down 15 percent and industrial adhesives and tapes down 5 percent

​ 

3m’s operating income margins increased 31 percentage points yearonyear for the year ending december 31 2020 factoring out the impact on operating income of special items as described in the certain amounts adjusted for special items  nongaap measures section below operating income margins increased 01 points to 213 percent for the year ending december 31 2020 when compared to 2019 various covid19 implications contributed in part to these results

​ 

overall the impact of the covid19 pandemic on 3m’s consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains as described above while it is not feasible to identify or quantify all the other direct and indirect implications on 3m’s results of operations below are factors that 3m believes have also affected its 2020 results

​ 

factors contributing to charges

 ​ 

factors providing benefits or other impacts

 ​ 

as previously disclosed in light of circumstances 3m took actions to ensure sources of cash may remain strong including the march 2020 issuance of 175 billion of registered notes suspension of share repurchases and the decrease of its 2020 capital spending to approximately 15 billion while capital spending decreased it included additional expansion of respirator production capacity 3m continues to have access to its commercial paper program and undrawn committed credit facility refer to the financial condition and liquidity section below for more information on the company’s liquidity position

the company also continues to evaluate the extent to which it may avail itself of various governmentsponsored covidresponse stimulus relief and production initiatives around the world such as under the defense production act dpa and cares act in the united states during 2020 and into january 2021 3m reached certain agreements with governments in the us and other countries involving just over 250 million of asset funding to expand capacity to supply n95 respirators 

​ 

due to the speed with which the covid19 situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery 3m is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition

​ 

managing currency risks 

the stronger us dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2020 compared to the same period last year net of the company’s hedging strategy foreign currency negatively impacted earnings for full year 2020 compared to the same period last year 3m utilizes a number of tools to hedge currency risk related to earnings 3m uses natural hedges such as pricing productivity hard currency and hard currencyindexed billings and localizing source of supply 3m also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk in the case of more liquid currencies 3m hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure using a 12 24 or 36 month horizon depending on the currency in question for less liquid currencies financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor thus this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above in either case 3m’s hedging approach is 

designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility ultimately allowing time for 3m’s businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace

​ 

financial condition 

​ 

3m generated 81 billion of operating cash flow in 2020 an increase of 10 billion when compared to 2019 this increase was primarily due to cost saving actions taken in response to covid19 and lower yearonyear significant litigationrelated charges and the timing of associated payments this followed an operating cash flow increase of 631 million when comparing 2019 to 2018 refer to the section entitled “financial condition and liquidity” later in mda for a discussion of items impacting cash flows 

​ 

in november 2018 3m’s board of directors replaced the company’s february 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program this new program authorizes the repurchase of up to 10 billion of 3m’s outstanding common stock with no preestablished end date in 2020 the company purchased 04 billion of its own stock compared to purchases of 14 billion in 2019 as of december 31 2020 approximately 78 billion remained available under the authorization in the first quarter of 2020 the company suspended repurchases under its boardapproved share repurchase program with other repurchase activity limited to 3m’s stock compensation plans the company plans to resume share purchases in 2021 in february 2021 3m’s board of directors declared a firstquarter 2021 dividend of 148 per share an increase of 1 percent this marked the 63 rd consecutive year of dividend increases for 3m 

​ 

raw materials 

​ 

in 2020 the coronavirus covid19 pandemic caused fluctuations in supply markets generally as demand for certain covidrelated products surged 3m saw a corresponding tightening in supply and some degree of price inflation in associated markets within the supply chain of less essential products 3m experienced raw material price deflation as economies slowed and certain producers scaled back or idled operations conversely as markets reopened and demand increased the company experienced raw material price inflation with some level of stabilization late in the year

​ 

in response the company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges including input management reformulations and multisourcing activities overall on a consolidated basis 3m experienced net raw material deflation in 2020 to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories strategic relationships with key suppliers and development as well as qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements in addition 3m evaluates suppliers’ conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements

​ 

pension and postretirement defined benefitcontribution plans 

​ 

on a worldwide basis 3m’s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at yearend 2020 the primary us qualified pension plan which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation was 91 percent funded and the international pension plans were 93 percent funded the us nonqualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors asset returns in 2020 for the primary us qualified pension plan were 136 as 3m strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2021 is 650 the primary us qualified pension plan yearend 2020 discount rate was 255 down 070 percentage points from the yearend 2019 discount rate of 325 the decrease in us discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation pbo the primary us qualified pension plan’s funded status decreased 1 percentage point in 2020 due to the higher pbo resulting from the discount rate decrease and partially offset by higher return on assets additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in note 13 pension and postretirement benefit plans

​ 

3m expects to contribute approximately 100 million to 200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2021 the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2021 3m expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2021 to decrease by approximately 40 million pretax when 

compared to 2020 refer to “critical accounting estimates” within mda and note 13 pension and postretirement benefit plans for additional information concerning 3m’s pension and postretirement plans

​ 

in addition other expense income was impacted by lower yearonyear pension and postretirement net periodic benefit nonservice benefits for 2020 and 2019 respectively the lower yearonyear benefit in 2020 was primarily due to the increased expense from lower december 31 2019 discount rates the decreases in 2019 was primarily due to the charge associated with the voluntary retirement program taken in the second quarter of 2019 in addition to the pension settlement charges in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to employee retirements refer to note 13 for additional details

performance by geographic ar ea 

​ 

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 2 and note 19

critical accounting estima tes 

​ 

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates

​ 

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings pension and postretirement obligations goodwill and certain longlived assets and uncertainty in income tax positions senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors

​ 

legal proceedings 

​ 

assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions the company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and estimable in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 450 contingencies  please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure and recording of liabilities related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 16 for additional information about such estimates

​ 

pension and postretirement obligations 

​ 

the company makes certain estimates and judgements in relation to its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations 

​ 

the benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date the company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the december 31 measurement date using the yields of a 

portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service costs are determined based on durationspecific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows the interest cost calculation is determined by applying durationspecific spot rates to the yearbyyear projected benefit payments the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income

​ 

using this methodology the company determined discount rates for its plans as follow

 ​ 

another significant element in determining the company’s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets for the primary us qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan longterm capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2021 is 650 a decrease from 675 in 2020 return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plans is 436 for 2021 compared to 470 for 2020 refer to note 13 for information on how the 2020 rates were determined

​ 

3m follows asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures in determining the fair value of plan assets within the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date see note 13 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses

​ 

for the year ended december 31 2020 the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement service cost expense of 456 million and a benefit of 50 million related to all nonservice pension and postretirement net benefit costs after settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other for a total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense of 406 million up from 357 million in 2019 

​ 

in 2021 defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately 497 million while nonservice pension and postretirement net benefit costs is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately 130 million for a total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense of 367 million a decrease of approximately 40 million compared to 2020

​ 

the table below summarizes the impact on 2021 pension expense for the us and international pension plans of a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2020 net periodic benefit cost the table assumes all other factors are held constant including the slope of the discount rate yield curves

​ 

 ​ 

goodwill and certain longlived assets 

​ 

the company makes certain estimates and judgments in relation to goodwill and certain longlived assets those include considerations made in the valuation of certain acquired identifiable definitelived and indefinitelived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in the recoverability and impairment assessments of longlived assets and goodwill

​ 

acquisition of certain identifiable definitelived and indefinitelived assets 

​ 

in conjunction with an acquisition of a business the company records identifiable definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition the corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows associated discount rates used to calculate present value asset life cycles royalty rates and customer retention rates the fair value calculated for indefinitelived intangible assets such as certain tradenames in addition to intangible assets that are definitelived such as patents customer relationships tradenames and other technologybased assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation due to the significant estimates used in determining their fair value as a result the company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price allocation subsequent to the acquisition not to exceed one year after the acquisition date until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized

​ 

assessments of longlived assets and goodwill 

​ 

as of december 31 2020 net property plant and equipment totaled 94 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled 58 billion of which 07 billion related to indefinitelived tradenames in addition 3m goodwill totaled approximately 138 billion as of december 31 2020 longlived assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or asset group’s ongoing use and eventual disposition if an impairment is identified the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis intangible assets with an indefinite life namely certain tradenames are not amortized indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year as further discussed below and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired if future noncash asset impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 

management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group factors which could result in future impairment charges include among others changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document in addition changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results

​ 

as of december 31 2020 the 07 billion of indefinitelived tradenames primarily relates to capital safety acquired in 2015 whose tradenames 520 million at acquisition date have been in existence for over 60 years refer to note 4 for more detail the primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets tradenames is a discounted cash flow approach specifically a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate markettechnology discount rate the relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to marketproduce the product in the first quarter of 2020 3m reflected an immaterial charge related to impairment of certain indefinitelived assets in 2020 based on annual impairment testing in the third quarter of 2020 no additional impairment was indicated 

​ 

3m goodwill totaled approximately 138 billion as of december 31 2020 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level but are required to be combined when reporting units 

within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the loss would equal that difference the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses in addition to using for businesses where the priceearnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted 3m also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions where applicable 3m uses a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring

​ 

as described in note 19 effective in the first quarter of 2020 the company changed its business segment reporting for any product changes that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units the results of which were immaterial in conjunction with the change in segment reporting 3m completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment existed as a result of this new segment structure the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2020 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time

​ 

based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2020 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units as of october 1 2020 3m had 22 primary reporting units with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 93 percent of the goodwill these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions advanced materials display materials and systems electronics materials solutions health information systems industrial adhesives and tapes medical solutions oral care solutions personal safety separation and purification sciences and transportation safety 

​ 

3m is a highly integrated enterprise where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them 

​ 

3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2021 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment

​ 

uncertainty in income tax positions 

​ 

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 10 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

in 2019 3m expended approximately 59 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues which are expensed capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business the company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility while capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be approximately 150 million to 220 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 3m cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of 

such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 the company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals which could adversely impact our results 

as previously reported the company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local state federal primarily the us environmental protection agency epa and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the company collectively known as “pfas” the pfas group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil water temperature chemical and fire resistance as well as electrical insulating properties the strength of the carbonfluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade these characteristics have made pfas critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones tablets and semiconductors they are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes commercial aircraft and lowemissions vehicles also rely on pfas technology pfas compounds are manufactured by various companies including 3m and are used in everyday products as science and technology evolve and advance and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that pfas compounds had the potential to build up over time 3m announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos globally as a precautionary measure we phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products with most of these activities in the us completed by the end of 2002 phased out products included aqueous film forming foam afff and coatings for food packaging for example 3m currently is defending lawsuits concerning various pfasrelated products and chemistries and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of pfas in a variety of jurisdictions as discussed in note 16 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results for example we recorded a pretax charge of 897 million inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the state of minnesota involving the presence of pfas in the groundwater surface 

water fish or other aquatic life and sediments in the state governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving pfas could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs civil or criminal proceedings the imposition of fines and penalties or other remedies as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities or otherwise

​ 

for 2019 while 3m experienced sales growth in its consumer and health care segments this was more than offset by declines in 3m’s safety and industrial and transportation and electronics segments these two businesses were impacted by softness in certain end markets china automotive and electronics and channel inventory adjustments particularly within asia pacific and the united states earnings were also impacted by second quarter restructuring actions taken to address lower sales volumes as well as inventory reductions to drive improved cash flow further restructuring actions were taken in fourth quarter to realign 3m’s organizational structure and operating model to improve growth and operational efficiency partially offsetting these impacts were benefits in the second half of 2019 from the second quarter restructuring actions

​ 

managing currency risks 

the stronger us dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2019 compared to the same period last year net of the company’s hedging strategy foreign currency was neutral to earnings for full year 2019 compared to the same period last year 3m utilizes a number of tools to hedge currency risk related to earnings 3m uses natural hedges such as pricing productivity hard currency and hard currencyindexed billings and localizing source of supply 3m also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk in the case of more liquid currencies 3m hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure using a 12 24 or 36 month horizon depending on the currency in question for less liquid currencies financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor thus this risk is 

largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above in either case 3m’s hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility ultimately allowing time for 3m’s businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace

​ 

financial condition 

​ 

3m generated 7070 billion of operating cash flow in 2019 an increase of 631 million when compared to 2018 this increase was primarily due to significant litigationrelated charges and the timing of associated payments that impacted 2019 and 2018 this followed an operating cash flow increase of 199 million when comparing 2018 to 2017 refer to the section entitled “financial condition and liquidity” later in mda for a discussion of items impacting cash flows

​ 

raw materials 

​ 

in 2019 the company experienced raw material price inflation across many material markets in all geographies in response the company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges including input management reformulations and multisourcing activities these succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories strategic relationships with key suppliers and development as well as qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and commodity price swaps in addition 3m evaluates suppliers’ conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements

​

​ 

cost of sales 

​ 

cost of sales includes manufacturing engineering and freight costs 

​ 

cost of sales measured as a percent of sales increased during full year 2019 when compared to full year 2018 increases primarily related to lower sales volume yearonyear which resulted in cost absorption penalties from lower sales volumes as all businesses worked to reduce inventories and improve cash flow and significant litigationrelated charges taken in 2019 as discussed earlier in the certain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigationrelated charges deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan 

subsidiary and enactmentmeasurement period adjustments related to the tax cuts and jobs act tcja  nongaap measures  these factors were partially offset by selling price increases which increased net sales yearonyear by 06 percent for full year 2019 

​ 

cost of sales as a percent of sales increased during 2018 primarily due to foreign currency effects net of hedge losses additionally cost of sales for full year 2018 were increased by the 2018 communication markets division related restructuring charges as discussed in note 5 this increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018 and selling price increases selling prices increased net sales yearonyear by 11 percent for full year 2018 these were partially offset by raw material cost increases and higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense 

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses 

​ 

sga in dollars decreased 75 percent for full year 2019 when compared to full year 2018 the decrease primarily related to indirect cost reductions and lower yearonyear impact related to significant litigationrelated charges as discussed earlier in the certain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigationrelated charges deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary and enactmentmeasurement period adjustments related to the tax cuts and jobs act tcja  nongaap measures section 

​ 

sga in dollars increased 147 percent for full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017 the increase is primarily associated with the communication markets divisionrelated restructuring charges as discussed in note 5 and the charge related to the minnesota nrd resolution as discussed earlier in the certain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigationrelated charges deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary and enactmentmeasurement period adjustments related to the tax cuts and jobs act tcja  nongaap measures section and further in note 16 this increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018

rd in dollars increased 90 million for the full year 2019 when compared to full year 2018 rd measured as a percent of sales was 59 in 2019 compared to 56 in 2018 and 59 in 2017 the increase from 2018 was driven by 3m continued investment in its key initiatives including rd aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets in addition rd increased due to additional spending related to the company’s acquisitions in 2019

​ 

rd in dollars decreased 49 million for full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017 the decrease primarily relates to rd no longer incurred related to the communication markets division which was divested in 2018

other expense income net 

​ 

see note 6 for a detailed breakout of this line item

​ 

interest expense net of interest income increased during 2019 and 2018 the increase in 2019 was driven by higher us average debt balances partially offset by the yearonyear increase in interest income driven by higher balances in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities during the year resulting from the proceeds from debt issuances in advance of the october 2019 acelity acquisition while 2017 interest expense included a 96 million early debt extinguishment charge 2018 net interest expense increased as a result of higher us average debt balances and higher borrowing costs

​ 

the increase in other expense income during 2019 was primarily due to the impact of deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary refer to note 1 for additional details 

​ 

in addition other expense income was impacted by lower yearonyear pension and postretirement net periodic benefit nonservice benefits of 5 million and 55 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively the lower yearonyear benefit in 2019 was primarily due to the second quarter 2019 charge associated with the voluntary retirement incentive program in addition to pension settlement charges in the fourth quarter 2019 related to employee retirements the decrease in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in net actuarial amortization expense refer to note 13 for additional details

​ 

provision for income taxes 

​ 

 ​ 

the effective tax rate for 2019 was 198 percent a decrease of 36 percentage points when compared to 2018 the effective tax rate for 2018 was 234 percent compared to 355 percent in 2017 a decrease of 121 percentage points the changes in the tax rates between years were impacted by many factors including measurement period adjustments related to the tax cuts and jobs act tcja prior year resolution of the nrd lawsuit and geographical income mix offset by the impact from the deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary as further described in the overview certain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigationrelated charges deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary and enactmentmeasurement period adjustments related to the tax cuts and jobs act tcja  nongaap measures section and in note 10 additional factors that impacted the tax rates between years were adjustments to uncertain tax positions and significant litigationrelated charges

​ 

3m currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2020 will be approximately 20 to 21 percent the tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits changes in tax laws and employee sharebased payment accounting as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes

​ 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 

​ 

 ​ 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non3m ownership interests in 3m consolidated entities the amount primarily relates to 3m india limited of which 3m’s effective ownership is 75 percent

​ 

currency effects 

​ 

3m estimates that yearonyear currency effects including hedging impacts increased pretax income by 1 million in 2019 and decreased pretax income by 42 million in 2018 these estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into us dollars the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks 3m estimates that yearonyear derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased pretax income by approximately 201 million in 2019 and decreased pretax income by approximately 92 million in 2018 refer to note 14 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning 3m’s hedging activities

additional actions impacting business segment reporting 

 ​ 

business segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented 3m manages its operations in four business segments the reportable segments are safety and industrial transportation and electronics health care and consumer

​ 

corporate and unallocated 

​ 

in addition to these four business segments 3m assigns certain costs to “corporate and unallocated” which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in note 19 corporate and unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items such as corporate investment gains and losses certain derivative gains and losses certain insurancerelated gains and losses certain litigation and environmental expenses corporate restructuring charges and certain under or overabsorbed costs eg pension that the company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments corporate and unallocated also includes sales costs and income from contract manufacturing transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the communication markets division following its divestiture in 2018 because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis

​ 

corporate and unallocated operating expenses decreased by 166 million in 2019 when compared to 2018 in 2018 and 2019 significant litigationrelated charges of 897 million and 762 million respectively were reflected in corporate and unallocated in 2018 and 2019 operating expenses included 127 million net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates and 140 million respectively of the restructuring actions further discussed in note 5 in the third quarter operating expenses were partially offset by a gain related to sales of certain properties in addition 3m’s defined benefit pension and postretirement servicecost expense allocation to corporate and unallocated decreased yearonyear

​ 

corporate and unallocated operating expenses increased by 1 billion in 2018 when compared to 2017 beginning in the second quarter of 2018 the operating income from contractual manufacturing and other arrangements described in the paragraph above were included in corporate and unallocated in addition in 2018 operating expenses included the restructuring charge of 127 million net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates as discussed in note 5 related to addressing corporate functional costs following the communication markets division divestiture in the first quarter of 2018 the minnesota nrd resolution 897 million inclusive of

performance by geographic ar ea 

​ 

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 19

​ 

refer to the “overview” section for a summary of net sales by geographic area and business segment

​ 

​ 

critical accounting estima tes 

​ 

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates

​ 

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings pension and postretirement obligations goodwill and certain longlived assets and uncertainty in income tax positions senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors

​ 

​ 

legal proceedings 

​ 

assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions the company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and estimable in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 450 contingencies  please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure and recording of liabilities related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 16 for additional information about such estimates

​ 

pension and postretirement obligations 

​ 

the company makes certain estimates and judgements in relation to its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations 

​ 

the benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date the company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the december 31 measurement date using the yields of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service costs are determined based on durationspecific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows the interest cost calculation is determined by applying durationspecific spot rates to the yearbyyear projected benefit payments the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income

​ 

using this methodology the company determined discount rates for its plans as follow

 ​ 

another significant element in determining the company’s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets for the primary us qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan longterm capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2020 is 675 a decrease from 700 in 2019 return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 470 for 2020 compared to 490 for 2019 refer to note 13 for information on how the 2019 rates were determined

​ 

3m follows asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures in determining the fair value of plan assets within the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date see note 13 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses

​ 

for the year ended december 31 2019 the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement service cost expense of 425 million and a benefit of 68 million related to all nonservice pension and postretirement net benefit costs after settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other for a total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense of 357 million down from 410 million in 2018 

​ 

in 2020 defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately 458 million while nonservice pension and postretirement net benefit costs before settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other is 

anticipated to be a benefit of approximately 67 million for a total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense of 391 million an increase of approximately 34 million compared to 2019

​ 

the table below summarizes the impact on 2020 pension expense for the us and international pension plans of a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2019 net periodic benefit cost the table assumes all other factors are held constant including the slope of the discount rate yield curves

​ 

 ​ 

goodwill and certain longlived assets 

​ 

the company makes certain estimates and judgments in relation to goodwill and certain longlived assets those include considerations made in the valuation of certain acquired identifiable definitelived and indefinitelived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in the recoverability and impairment assessments of longlived assets and goodwill

​ 

acquisition of certain identifiable definitelived and indefinitelived assets 

​ 

in conjunction with an acquisition of a business the company records identifiable definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition the corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows associated discount rates used to calculate present value asset life cycles royalty rates and customer retention rates the fair value calculated for indefinitelived intangible assets such as certain tradenames in addition to intangible assets that are definitelived such as patents customer relationships tradenames and other technologybased assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation due to the significant estimates used in determining their fair value as a result the company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price allocation subsequent to the acquisition not to exceed one year after the acquisition date until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized

​ 

assessments of longlived assets and goodwill 

​ 

as of december 31 2019 net property plant and equipment totaled 93 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled 64 billion of which 06 billion related to indefinitelived tradenames in addition 3m goodwill totaled approximately 134 billion as of december 31 2019 longlived assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or asset group’s ongoing use and eventual disposition if an impairment is identified the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis intangible assets with an indefinite life namely certain tradenames are not amortized indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year as further discussed below and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired if future noncash asset impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 

management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group factors which could result in future impairment charges include among others changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document in addition changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results

​ 

as of december 31 2019 the 06 billion of indefinitelived tradenames primarily relates to capital safety acquired in 2015 whose tradenames 520 million at acquisition date have been in existence for over 55 years refer to note 4 for more detail the primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets tradenames is a discounted cash flow approach specifically a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate markettechnology discount rate the relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to marketproduce the product based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2019 no impairment was indicated the discounted cash flows related to the capital safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent in aggregate

​ 

3m goodwill totaled approximately 134 billion as of december 31 2019 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the loss would equal that difference the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses in addition to using for businesses where the priceearnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted 3m also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions where applicable 3m used a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring

​ 

as described in note 19 effective in the second quarter of 2019 the company realigned its former five business segments into four to enable the company to better serve global customers and markets in addition effective in the first quarter of 2019 3m made business segment reporting changes to align its businesses around markets and customers for any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units during both the first and second quarters of 2019 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2019 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time

​ 

based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2019 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units as of october 1 2019 3m had 23 primary reporting units with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 91 percent of the goodwill these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions advanced materials display materials and systems electronics materials solutions health information systems industrial adhesives and tapes medical solutions oral care solutions personal safety separation and purification sciences and transportation safety 

​ 

3m is a highly integrated enterprise where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them 

​ 

3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2020 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 10 for additional 

information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

raw materials 

  

in 2018 the company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide in response the company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges including input management reformulations and multisourcing activities these succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories strategic relationships with key suppliers and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and commodity price swaps 

  

environmental law compliance 

  

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to “environmental matters and litigation” in note 16 commitments and contingencies 

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies the company’s commitment to a plan of action or approval by regulatory agencies environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2018 3m expended approximately 27 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues which are expensed capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s emphasis on environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be approximately 75 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 

  

 

  

while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

  

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part i item 2 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

  

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic political and capital markets conditions the company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as slower economic growth disruptions in financial markets economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions inflation elevated unemployment levels sluggish or uneven recovery government actions impacting international trade agreements imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the company or its customers and suppliers or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates tax rates tax laws or exchange control ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

 change in the company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 3m currently has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and has an a1 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service the company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders the addition of further leverage to the company’s capital structure could impact 3m’s credit ratings in the future failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets 

  

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products and v changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data 

  

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately 60 percent of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

 

  

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma and engages in ongoing global business transformation business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internalexternal service delivery across 3m to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity while allowing 3m to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency this is enabled by the ongoing multiyear phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

  

 the company employs information technology systems to support its business including ongoing phased implementation of an erp system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations compromise information belonging to the company or its customers suppliers and employees exposing the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation in the ordinary course of business the company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of businesses additionally the company collects and stores certain data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems patching maintenance and backup of systems and data the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses ransomware telecommunication or utility failures systems failures service or cloud provider breaches natural disasters or other catastrophic events it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period up to and including several years while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of vulnerabilities to the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure none of them to date has had a material impact to the company there may be other challenges and risks as the company upgrades and standardizes its erp system on a worldwide basis any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruptions or shutdowns and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business although the company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured 

  

 the companys defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results the performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan 

 

  

assets and relevant legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks including those involving product liability antitrust intellectual property environmental the us foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery anticorruption or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 16 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements

performance by geographic ar ea 

  

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 19

critical accounting estima tes 

  

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

legal proceedings 

  

the categories of claims for which the company has a probable and estimable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 16 for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

  

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the primary us definedbenefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january 1 2009 the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 715 compensation — retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are 

 

  

appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date see note 13 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination the benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date the company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the december 31 measurement date using the yields of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service costs are determined based on durationspecific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows the interest cost calculation is determined by applying durationspecific spot rates to the yearbyyear projected benefit payments the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income 

  

using this methodology the company determined discount rates for its plans as follow 



  

another significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan longterm capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2019 is 700 a decrease from 725 in 2018 refer to note 13 for information on how the 2018 rate was determined return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 490 for 2019 compared to 502 for 2018 

  

for the year ended december 31 2018 the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement service cost expense of 483 million and a benefit of 73 million related to all nonservice pension and postretirement net benefit costs after settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other for a total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense of 410 million up from 334 million in 2017 

  

in 2019 defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately 420 million while nonservice pension and postretirement net benefit costs before settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately 140 million for a total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense of 280 million a decrease of approximately 130 million compared to 2018 

  

the table below summarizes the impact on 2019 pension expense for the us and international pension plans of a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2018 net periodic benefit cost the table assumes all other factors are held constant including the slope of the discount rate yield curves 



  

 

  

asset impairments 

  

as of december 31 2018 net property plant and equipment totaled 87 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled 27 billion management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group 

  

of the 27 billion in net identifiable intangible assets 06 billion relates to indefinitelived tradenames primarily capital safety whose tradenames 520 million at acquisition date have been in existence for over 55 years refer to note 4 for more detail the primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets tradenames is a discounted cash flow approach specifically a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate markettechnology discount rate the relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to marketproduce the product if the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment exists and the asset value must be written down based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2018 no impairment was indicated the discounted cash flows related to the capital safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent in aggregate 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 101 billion as of december 31 2018 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 

  

an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the loss would equal that difference the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses in addition to using for businesses where the priceearnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted 3m also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 

  

as described in note 18 effective in the first quarter of 2018 3m made business segment reporting changes for any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units during the first quarter of 2018 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2018 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time 

  

as of october 1 2018 3m had 24 primary reporting units with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 89 percent of the goodwill these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions advanced materials display materials and systems electronics materials solutions health information systems industrial adhesives and tapes infection prevention oral care solutions personal safety separation and purification and transportation safety the estimated fair value for all reporting units was in excess of carrying value by approximately 79 percent or more 3m’s market value at both december 31 2018 and september 30 2018 was significantly in excess of its shareholders’ equity of approximately 10 billion 

  

as discussed in note 3 3m sold its communication markets division in 2018 which comprised substantially all of the 272 million reduction in goodwill associated with divestitures during 2018 

  

in 2018 3m determined fair values using either an industry priceearnings ratio approach or a discounted cash flows analysis where applicable 3m used a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions using projected cash flows that were 

 

  

weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring 

  

3m is a highly integrated enterprise where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2018 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units 

  

factors which could result in future impairment charges include among others changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document in addition changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results as indicated above during the first quarter of 2018 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed longlived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable if future noncash asset impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2019 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

  

income taxes 

  

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 10 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary 

  

starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 and continuing into 2018 3m recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja the expense is primarily related to the tcja’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of nonus subsidiaries and remeasurement of 3m’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as discussed in note 10 this expense was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2018

financial condition and liquidi ty 

  

the strength and stability of 3m’s business model and strong free cash flow capability together with proven capital markets access positions the company to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure investing in 3m’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment including research and development capital expenditures and commercialization capability investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions 3m will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases sources for cash availability in the united states such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders as well as funding us acquisitions and other items as needed the tcja creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3m to access international cash positions on a continual and ongoing basis and will help support us capital deployments needs for those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely the company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for us operations see note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely

working capital nongaap measure 

  



  

various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities 3m believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and shortterm financial health 

  

working capital decreased 125 million compared with december 31 2017 current asset balance changes decreased working capital by 568 million driven by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories discussed further below current liability balance changes increased working capital by 443 million primarily due to decreases in shortterm debt 

  

accounts receivable increased 109 million from december 31 2017 primarily due to increased sales foreign currency impacts decreased december 31 2018 accounts receivable by 166 million and divestitures net of acquisitions decreased accounts receivable by 29 million inventory increased 332 million from december 31 2017 impacted by maintenance of additional inventory during

return on invested capital nongaap measure 

  

return on invested capital roic is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles therefore roic should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies the company defines roic as adjusted net income net income including noncontrolling interest plus aftertax interest expense divided by average invested capital equity plus debt the company believes roic is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation the calculation is provided in the below table 

  

in 2018 roic of 222 percent was higher than 2017 the increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 was negatively impacted by the measurement period adjustments taken in 2018 to the expense recorded in december 2017 from the enactment of the tcja the impact from the resolution of the minnesota natural resource damages nrd resolution and the impact from the gain on sale of the communication markets division net of restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture which combined reduced roic by 2 percentage points in 2018 

  

in 2017 roic of 213 percent was lower than 2016 this decrease related to the net impact of the enactment of the tcja and increases in commercial paper borrowings in conjunction with the december 2017 us defined benefit pension plan contribution which combined reduced roic by 3 percentage points in 2017

free cash flow nongaap measure 

  

free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap therefore they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies the company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3m the company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash the first quarter of each year is typically 3m’s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2018 2017 and 2016 

  

in 2018 free cash flow conversion was impacted by the 176 million measurement period adjustment to the tax expense recorded in december 2017 from the enactment of the tcja the 897 million pretax impact related to the resolution of the minnesota natural resource damages nrd and the 381 million pretax impact from the gain on sale of the communication markets division net of restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture on a combined basis these items reduced free cash flow conversion by 2 percentage points

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

as of december 31 2018 the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements refer to the section entitled “warrantiesguarantees” in note 16 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

 

  

contractual obligations 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2018 follows 

  



  

longterm debt payments due in 2019 and 2020 include floating rate notes totaling 124 million and 95 million respectively as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2017 3m recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja the expense is primarily related to the tcja’s transition tax the transition tax is payable over 8 years at the election of the taxpayer as discussed in note 10 this balance was finalized in 2018 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

other obligations included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc 740 which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months when applicable the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the longterm portion of the total net tax liability of 655 million is excluded from the preceding table in addition the transition tax prescribed under the tax cuts and jobs act tcja is separately included in the table above refer to note 10 for further details 

  

as discussed in note 13 the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2019 and company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table

foreign exchange rates risk 

  

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions 3m is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges 3m may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction the maximum length of time over which 3m hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months in addition 3m enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing transactions as circumstances warrant the company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the company’s net investments in foreign operations the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was 34 billion at december 31 2018 the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was 25 billion at december 31 2018 in addition as of december 31 2018 the company had 41 billion euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as nonderivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in note 14 in the “net investment hedges” section

precious metals these instruments are not designated in hedged relationships and the extent to which they were outstanding at december 31 2018 was not material 

  

value at risk 

  

the value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the company’s sensitivity to changes in currency rates interest rates and commodity prices a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on aftertax earnings related to financial instruments primarily debt derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2018 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12month time horizon the exposure to changes in currency rates model used 9 currencies interest rates related to two currencies and commodity prices related to five commodities this model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures 

  



  

in addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange rates recent historical information is as follows 3m estimates that yearonyear currency effects including hedging impacts decreased pretax income by 42 million and 111 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively this estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into us dollars the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks 3m estimates that yearonyear derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pretax income by approximately 92 million and 152 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively 

  

an analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each yearend a one percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 75 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 42 million per year global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3m production and other facilities primarily electricity and natural gas

raw materials 

  

in 2017 the company continued to manage yearonyear raw material input costs benefiting from input management reformulations and multisourcing activities these efforts more than offset increasing costs in certain raw material categories in oilderivative chemical feedstock markets oilderivative cost increases also impact other feedstock categories including petroleum based materials minerals metals and wood pulp based products to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories strategic 

 

  

relationships with key suppliers and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and commodity price swaps 

  

environmental law compliance 

  

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to “environmental matters and litigation” in note 15 commitments and contingencies 

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies the company’s commitment to a plan of action or approval by regulatory agencies environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives

 item 1a risk factor s 

  

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

  

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic political and capital markets conditions the company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as slower economic growth disruptions in financial markets economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary 

 

  

conditions inflation elevated unemployment levels sluggish or uneven recovery government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the company or its customers and suppliers or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates tax rates tax laws or exchange control ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

 change in the company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 3m currently has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and has an a1 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service the company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders the addition of further leverage to the company’s capital structure could impact 3m’s credit ratings in the future failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets 

  

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately 60 percent of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions 

 

  

future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma and engages in ongoing global business transformation business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internalexternal service delivery across 3m to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity while allowing 3m to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency this is enabled by the ongoing multiyear phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

  

 the company employs information technology systems to support its business including ongoing phased implementation of an erp system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations compromise information belonging to the company or its customers suppliers and employees exposing the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation in the ordinary course of business the company relies on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally the company collects and stores certain data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems patching maintenance and backup of systems and data the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures service or cloud provider breaches natural disasters or other catastrophic events it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period up to and including several years while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats to the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure none of them to date has had a material impact to the company there may be other challenges and risks as the company upgrades and standardizes its erp system on a worldwide basis any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business although the company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured 

  

 the companys defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results the performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets and relevant legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks including those involving product liability antitrust intellectual property environmental the us foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery anticorruption or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 15 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements

operating expenses 



  

operating income margins increased in 2017 versus 2016 driven by gains from sale of businesses partially offset by cost of sales increases a number of factors impact the various income statement line items such as raw material cost management strategic investments divestitures foreign currency cost management and pension and postretirement effects expanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below pension and postretirement expense is recorded in cost of sales selling general and administrative expenses sga and research development and related expenses rd in total 3m’s defined benefit pension and postretirement expense increased 82 million in 2017 compared to a decrease of 305 million in 2016 refer to note 12 pension and postretirement plans for components of net periodic benefit cost and the assumptions used to determine net cost 

  

the company is investing in business transformation business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internalexternal service delivery across 3m to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity while allowing 3m to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency this is enabled by the ongoing multiyear phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system on a worldwide basis 

  

in 2017 as referenced above in the “divestitures and strategic investments” section 3m incurred 413 million in incremental strategic actions primarily reported within the cost of sales and sga income statement line items 

  

of these strategic investments 3m incurred 96 million net of adjustments in restructuring actions and 47 million in exit activities during 2017 in addition in the fourth quarter of 2015 3m incurred 114 million in restructuring charges refer to note 4 for additional information on the impact to operating expenses 

  

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales includes manufacturing engineering and freight costs 

  

cost of sales as a percent of sales increased during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments in productivity portfolio actions and footprint optimization foreign currency effects net of hedge impacts and higher defined benefit pension expense this was partially offset by a yearonyear reduction in raw material input costs as a result of sourcing cost reduction projects selling prices were flat yearonyear for the full year 2017 

  

cost of sales as a percent of sales decreased in 2016 due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases as selling prices increased net sales by 07 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 35 percent yearonyear in addition cost of sales as a percent of sales benefited from lower defined benefit pension and postretirement costs fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges also provided a favorable yearonyear comparison 

 

  

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

sga increased 350 million yearon year or 56 percent during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments and higher defined benefit pension expense sga decreased 7 million or 01 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015 with 2016 results benefiting from foreign currency translation and productivity benefits related to the fourth quarter 2015 restructuring in addition sga in 2016 benefited from lower defined benefit pension and postretirement expense fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges also provided a favorable yearonyear comparison 

  

research development and related expenses 

  

rd increased 115 million yearonyear and decreased 28 million yearonyear in 2017 and 2016 respectively 3m continued to invest in its key initiatives including rd aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets rd measured as a percent of sales was 58 percent in 2017 2016 and 2015 

  

gain on sale of businesses 

  

in 2017 3m sold the assets of its safety prescription eyewear business completed the related sale or transfer of control as applicable of its identity management business sold its tolling and automated licensenumber plate recognition and electronic monitoring businesses and sold the assets of its electrical markinglabeling business on a combined basis these divestitures resulted in a gain on the sale of businesses of 586 million 3m also divested certain businesses in 2016 and 2015 resulting in gains of 111 million and 47 million respectively refer to note 2 for additional detail on these divestitures 

  

operating income margin 

  

3m uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools refer to the table below for a reconciliation of operating income margins for 2017 and 2016 

  



  

year 2017 and fourth quarter operating income 

  

operating income margins increased 01 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 07 percentage points for the full year 2017 when compared to the same periods last year 3m benefited from higher organic localcurrency sales growth and productivity partially offset by actuarial adjustments to the company’s respirator maskasbestos liability accrual acquisitions and divestitures consist of the transactions and integration costs net of income that relate to the acquisition of scott safety in addition to the yearonyear divestiture gains refer to note 2 and nonrepeating operating losses from divested businesses which combined reduced operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2017 and benefited operating income margins for the full year 2017 items that reduced operating margins were incremental strategic investments in growth productivity and portfolio actions in addition to charges related to 3m’s optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint for full year 2017 the benefit from yearonyear divestiture gains and nonrepeating net operating losses from divested businesses primarily related to the sale of identity 

 

  

management was partially offset by the impact of the scott safety acquisition noted earlier 3m also benefited from raw material sourcing cost reduction projects lastly operating margins were reduced by foreign currency effects net of hedge impacts and higher yearonyear defined benefit pension expense 

  

year 2016 operating income 

  

operating income margins were 240 percent in 2016 compared to 229 percent in 2015 an increase of 11 percentage points 3m benefited from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs plus lower yearonyear defined benefit pension and postretirement expense acquisitions and divestitures had a favorable impact on operating margins this included solid performances from both the capital safety and membrana acquisitions divestiture impacts relate to the polyfoam business the library systems business and the license plate converting business in france in addition in the fourth quarter of 2016 3m sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology outlicensing business items that reduced operating income margins included 2016 strategic investments as 3m took actions to better optimize its manufacturing footprint and accelerated growth investments across its businesses foreign currency impacts net of hedging also reduced operating income margins organic volume productivity and other decreased operating margins as a result of lower asset utilization primarily in the industrial and electronics and energy businesses also 3m had an unfavorable arbitration ruling on an insurance claim commercial litigation settlements related to andover healthcare and transweb and accruals for respirator maskasbestos liabilities these declines within organic volume productivity and other were partially offset by 2015 restructuring charges which provided a favorable yearonyear comparison and productivity benefits in 2016 related to the 2015 restructuring actions 

  

other expense income net 

  

see note 5 for a detailed breakout of this line item 

  

interest expense increased during 2017 and 2016 due to higher average debt balances and higher us borrowing costs in addition in october 2017 via cash tender offers 3m repurchased 305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes the company recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of 96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 which was included within interest expense capitalized interest related to property plant and equipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense capitalized interest was 12 million 10 million and 13 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

  

interest income increased yearonyear in both 2017 and 2016 due to higher average interest rates 

  

provision for income taxes 

  



  

the effective tax rate for 2017 was 355 percent compared to 283 percent in 2016 an increase of 72 percentage points the effective tax rate for 2016 was 283 percent compared to 291 percent in 2015 a decrease of 08 percentage points the changes in the tax rates between years were impacted by many factors including the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja in december 2017 as further described in the overview “ income earnings per share and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja nongaap measures” section and in note 9 during the fourth quarter of 2017 3m recorded a net tax expense of 762 million related to the enactment of the tcja the expense is primarily related to the tcja’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of nonus subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3m’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the tcja’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts this provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the december 2017 enactment of the tcja as provided by recent sec guidance 

  

the tcja establishes new tax laws that will also affect 2018 and future periods including but not limited to 1 reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent 2 the creation of the base erosion antiabuse tax beat 3 the creation of a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income gilti 4 a 

 

  

general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 5 limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the us income tax liability 6 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation and 7 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction considering the impacts of the tcja and other factors the company currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2018 will be approximately 20 to 22 percent the tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits changes in tax laws measurement period adjustment effects on the provisional items and remaining analyses to complete noted in note 9 related to the 2017 impact of the tcja employee sharebased payment accounting as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes

net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 

  



  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non3m ownership interests in 3m consolidated entities the amount primarily relates to 3m india limited of which 3m’s effective ownership is 75 percent 

  

currency effects 

  

3m estimates that yearonyear currency effects including hedging impacts decreased pretax income by 111 million and 127 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively these estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into us dollars the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks 3m estimates that yearonyear derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pretax income by approximately 152 million and 69 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively refer to note 13 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning 3m’s hedging activities 

  

performance by business seg ment 

  

for a detailed discussion of the markets served and types of products offered by 3m’s business segments see item 1 business segments financial information and other disclosures are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements effective in the first quarter of 2017 as part of 3m’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers the company made the following changes 

  

integration of former renewable energy division 



  

creation of automotive and aerospace solutions division 



  

 

  

consolidation of us customer account activity  impacting dual credit reporting 



  

business segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented 3m manages its operations in five business segments the reportable segments are industrial safety and graphics health care electronics and energy and consumer 

  

corporate and unallocated 

  

in addition to these five business segments 3m assigns certain costs to “corporate and unallocated” which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in note 17 corporate and unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items such as corporate investment gains and losses certain derivative gains and losses certain insurancerelated gains and losses certain litigation and environmental expenses corporate restructuring charges and certain under or overabsorbed costs eg pension stockbased compensation that the company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis 

  

corporate and unallocated operating expenses increased by 80 million in 2017 when compared to 2016 in both the first and second quarters of 2017 a portion of the severance actions were reflected in corporate and unallocated in the fourth quarter an incremental 58 million was reflected within corporate and unallocated related to the company’s actuarial adjustments to its respirator maskasbestos liability accrual in addition 3m’s defined benefit pension and postretirement expense allocation to corporate and unallocated increased by approximately 30 million in 2017 

  

corporate and unallocated operating expenses decreased by 77 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 3m’s defined benefit pension and postretirement expense allocation to corporate and unallocated decreased by 223 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 in addition the portion of the 2015 restructuring actions charged to corporate 37 million provided a favorable yearonyear comparison these decreases were partially offset by an increase in legal expenses related to an unfavorable second quarter 2016 arbitration ruling on an insurance claim commercial litigation settlements related to andover healthcare and transweb and accruals for respirator maskasbestos liabilities

performance by geographic ar ea 

  

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 18

critical accounting estima tes 

  

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

legal proceedings 

  

the categories of claims for which the company has a probable and estimable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 15 for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

  

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the primary us definedbenefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january 1 2009 the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 715 compensation — retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan 

 

  

as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date see note 12 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination the benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date the company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the december 31 measurement date using the yields of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits historically the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan’s benefit obligation was also used for the calculation of all net periodic benefit costs including the measurement of the service and interest costs beginning in 2016 3m changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs the new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service costs are determined based on durationspecific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows the interest cost calculation is determined by applying durationspecific spot rates to the yearbyyear projected benefit payments the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income the company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates the company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016 

  

using this methodology the company determined discount rates for its plans as follow 



  

another significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan longterm capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2018 is 725 equal to 2017 refer to note 12 for information on how the 2017 rate was determined return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 502 for 2018 compared to 516 for 2017 

  

for the year ended december 31 2017 the company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense after settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other of 333 million up from 251 million in 2016 defined benefit pension and postretirement expense before settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other is anticipated to increase to approximately 409 million in 2018 an increase of 76 million compared to 2017 

  

the table below summarizes the impact on 2018 pension expense for the us and international pension plans of a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions 

 

  

used to measure plan liabilities and 2017 net periodic benefit cost the table assumes all other factors are held constant including the slope of the discount rate yield curves 



  

asset impairments 

  

as of december 31 2017 net property plant and equipment totaled 89 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled 29 billion management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group 

  

of the 29 billion in net identifiable intangible assets 06 billion relates to indefinitelived tradenames primarily capital safety whose tradenames 520 million at acquisition date have been in existence for over 55 years refer to note 2 for more detail the primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets tradenames is a discounted cash flow approach specifically a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate markettechnology discount rate the relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to marketproduce the product if the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment exists and the asset value must be written down based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2017 no impairment was indicated the discounted cash flows related to the capital safety tradename exceeded its book value by more than 15 percent 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 105 billion as of december 31 2017 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 

  

an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the loss would equal that difference the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses in addition to using for businesses where the priceearnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted 3m also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 

  

as described in note 17 effective in the first quarter of 2017 3m made business segment reporting changes for any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units during the first quarter of 2017 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2017 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time 

  

as of october 1 2017 3m had 24 primary reporting units with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 86 percent of the goodwill these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions advanced materials communication markets display materials and systems health information systems industrial adhesives and 

 

  

tapes infection prevention oral care solutions personal safety separation and purification and transportation safety the estimated fair value for all reporting units was in excess of carrying value by approximately 40 percent or more 3m’s market value at both december 31 2017 and september 30 2017 was significantly in excess of its shareholders’ equity of approximately 12 billion 

  

as discussed in note 2 3m announced the sale of substantially all of its communication markets division which is expected to close in 2018 which will result in an associated goodwill reduction of approximately 270 million upon sale 

  

in 2017 3m determined fair values using either an industry priceearnings ratio approach or a discounted cash flows analysis where applicable 3m used a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring 

  

3m is a highly integrated enterprise where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2017 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units 

  

factors which could result in future impairment charges include among others changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document in addition changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results as indicated above during the first quarter of 2017 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed longlived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable if future noncash asset impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2018 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

  

income taxes 

  

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 9 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2017 3m recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja the expense is primarily related to the tcja’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of nonus subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3m’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the tcja’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts as discussed in note 9 this expense is a provisional amount and is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the december 2017 enactment of the tcja as provided by recent sec guidance

net debt nongaap measure 

  

net debt is not defined under us gaap and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash cash equivalents and current and longterm marketable securities 3m believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3m considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position the following table provides net debt as of december 31 2017 and 2016

working capital nongaap measure 

  



  

various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities 3m believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and shortterm financial health 

 

  

  

working capital increased 11 billion during 2017 when compared to december 31 2016 current asset balance changes increased working capital by 26 billion driven by increases in cashcash equivalents and marketable securities in addition to higher accounts receivable and inventories discussed further below current liability balance changes decreased working capital by 15 billion largely due to increases in shortterm borrowings with commercial paper outstanding of 745 million at december 31 2017 compared to none outstanding at december 31 2016 

  

accounts receivable and inventory turns nongaap measures 

  

accounts receivable and inventory turns are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 3m defines accounts receivable turns as quarterly net sales multiplied by 4 divided by ending accounts receivable – net and defines inventory turns as quarterly manufacturing cost multiplied by 4 divided by ending inventory 3m believes accounts receivable turns is meaningful to investors as a measure of how efficiently the company manages credit and collects from its customers for inventory turns calculation purposes manufacturing cost is defined as cost of sales less freight and engineering costs 3m believes inventory turns is meaningful to investors as a measure of how quickly inventory is sold details of these calculations follow 

  



  



  

accounts receivable increased 519 million yearonyear in 2017 primarily due to increased sales in addition foreign currency impacts increased 2017 accounts receivable by 215 million and acquisitions net of divestitures increased accounts receivable by 57 million as a result accounts receivable turns decreased 2 percent versus 2016 

  

inventory increased 649 million yearonyear in 2017 foreign currency impacts increased 2017 inventory by 210 million and acquisitions net of divestitures increased inventory by 51 million higher fourth quarter sales contributed to a 10 percent increase in cost of sales while inventory increased 19 percent which combined contributed to an 8 percent decrease in inventory turns 

  

on a seasonal basis both accounts receivable and inventory turns are historically higher at yearend driven by lower yearend accounts receivable and inventory balances 

 

  

return on invested capital nongaap measure 

  

return on invested capital roic is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles therefore roic should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies the company defines roic as adjusted net income net income including noncontrolling interest plus aftertax interest expense divided by average invested capital equity plus debt the company believes roic is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation the calculation is provided in the below table 

  

in 2017 roic of 213 percent was lower than both 2016 and 2015 this decrease related to the net impact of the enactment of the tcja and increases in commercial paper borrowings in conjunction with the december 2017 us defined benefit pension plan contribution which combined reduced roic by 3 percentage points in 2017

in 2016 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 242 million compared to the same period in 2015 with this increase primarily due to lower yearonyear cash taxes and higher net income these items were partially offset by higher company pension contributions the combination of accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by 108 million in 2016 compared to working capital increase of 46 million in 2015 gain on sale of businesses in the preceding table reflects an adjustment for divestiture gains in 2016 discussed in note 2 as cash divestiture activity is presented as proceeds from sale of businesses within investing activities not operating activities

raw materials 

  

in 2016 the company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel due largely to price decreases in crude oil and the derivative chemical feedstock markets this in turn drove yearonyear cost decreases in many feedstock categories including petroleum based materials minerals metals and wood pulp based products to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and commodity price swaps 

  

environmental law compliance 

  

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to “environmental matters and litigation” in note 14 commitments and contingencies 

 

  

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies the company’s commitment to a plan of action or approval by regulatory agencies environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2016 3m expended about 28 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues which are expensed capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s emphasis on environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be about 70 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions

 item 1a risk factor s 

  

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

  

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic political and capital markets conditions the company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as slower economic growth disruptions in financial markets economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary 

 

  

conditions inflation elevated unemployment levels sluggish or uneven recovery government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the company or its customers and suppliers or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates tax rates tax laws or exchange control ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

 change in the company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 3m currently has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and has an a1 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service in march 2016 moody’s downgraded 3m’s rating from aa3 to a1 revised 3m’s outlook from negative to stable and affirmed the company’s shortterm rating of p1 this ratings action followed 3m’s announcement of its new fiveyear plan for the period 2016 through 2020 in which the company communicated its intent to further increase financial leverage the company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders the company’s ongoing transition to a betteroptimized capital structure financed with additional lowcost debt could impact 3m’s credit rating in the future failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets 

  

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately 60 percent of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results the 

 

  

company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma and engages in ongoing global business transformation business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internalexternal service delivery across 3m to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity while allowing 3m to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency this is enabled by the ongoing multiyear phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

  

 the company employs information technology systems to support its business including ongoing phased implementation of an erp system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations compromise information belonging to the company and its customers suppliers and employees exposing the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation in the ordinary course of business the company relies on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally the company collects and stores certain data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems which are continuously reviewed and upgraded the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures service providers including cloud services natural disasters or other catastrophic events it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period up to and including several years while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats to the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure none of them to date has had a material impact to the company there may be other challenges and risks as the company upgrades and standardizes its erp system on a worldwide basis any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business although the company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured 

  

 the companys defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results the performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets and relevant legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks including those involving product liability antitrust intellectual property environmental the us foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery anticorruption or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the

the company currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2017 will be approximately 28 to 29 percent the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits changes in tax laws and employee sharebased payment accounting as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes

performance by geographic ar ea 

  

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 17

critical accounting estima tes 

  

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

legal proceedings 

  

the categories of claims for which the company has a probable and estimable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 14 for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

  

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the primary us definedbenefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective 

 

  

january 1 2009 the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 715 compensation — retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date see note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination the benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date the company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the december 31 measurement date using the yields of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits historically the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan’s benefit obligation was also used for the calculation of all net periodic benefit costs including the measurement of the service and interest costs beginning in 2016 3m changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs the new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service costs are determined based on durationspecific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows the interest cost calculation is determined by applying durationspecific spot rates to the yearbyyear projected benefit payments the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income the company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates the company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016 

  

using this methodology the company determined discount rates for its plans as follow 



  

another significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2017 is 725 025 lower than 2016 refer to note 11 for information on how the 2016 rate was determined return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 516 for 2017 compared to 577 for 2016 

  

for the year ended december 31 2016 the company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense after settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other of 251 million down from 556 million in 2015 defined benefit pension and postretirement expense before settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other is anticipated to increase to approximately 325 million in 2017 an increase of 74 million compared to 2016 

 

  

  

the table below summarizes the impact on 2017 pension expense for the us and international pension plans of a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2016 net periodic benefit cost the table assumes all other factors are held constant including the slope of the discount rate yield curves 



  

asset impairments 

  

as of december 31 2016 net property plant and equipment totaled 85 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled 23 billion management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group 

  

of the 23 billion in net identifiable intangible assets 06 billion relates to indefinitelived tradenames primarily capital safety whose tradenames 520 million at acquisition date have been in existence for over 55 years refer to note 2 for more detail the primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets tradenames is a discounted cash flow approach specifically a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate markettechnology discount rate the relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to marketproduce the product if the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment exists and the asset value must be written down based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2016 no impairment was indicated the discounted cash flows related to the capital safety tradename exceeded its book value by more than 10 percent 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 92 billion as of december 31 2016 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 

  

an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses in addition to businesses where the priceearnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted 3m also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 

  

as described in note 16 effective in the first quarter of 2016 3m made a product line reporting change involving two of its business segments for any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units during the first quarter of 2016 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2016 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time 

  

 

  

as of october 1 2016 3m had 26 primary reporting units with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 86 percent of the goodwill these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions advanced materials communication markets display materials and systems health information systems industrial adhesives and tapes infection prevention oral care solutions personal safety which includes the capital safety acquisition separation and purification which includes the membrana acquisition and traffic safety and security the estimated fair values for these reporting units were in excess of carrying value by approximately 35 percent or more except for one reporting unit with approximately 250 million of goodwill where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 30 percent 3m’s market value at both december 31 2016 and september 30 2016 was significantly in excess of its shareholders’ equity of approximately 10 billion and 12 billion at december 31 2016 and september 30 2016 respectively 

  

in 2016 3m primarily used an industry priceearnings ratio approach but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units to determine fair values where applicable 3m used a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring 

  

3m is an integrated materials enterprise thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2016 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units 

  

factors which could result in future impairment charges include among others changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document in addition changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results as indicated above during the first quarter of 2016 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed longlived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable if future noncash asset impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2017 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

  

income taxes 

  

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 8 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities 3m believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are useful measures of performance and uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap therefore they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 3m defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment which is classified as an investing activity it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

as of december 31 2016 the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements refer to the section entitled “warrantiesguarantees” in note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 follows 

  

contractual obligations 

  



  

longterm debt payments due in 2017 and 2018 include floating rate notes totaling 150 million classified as current portion of longterm debt and 71 million included in other borrowings in the longterm debt table respectively as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments interest projections on both floating and fixed rate longterm debt including the effects of interest rate swaps are based on effective interest rates as of december 31 2016 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates 

 

  

include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

other obligations included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc 740 which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the longterm portion of the net tax liability of 284 million is excluded from the preceding table refer to note 8 for further details 

  

as discussed in note 11 the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2017 and company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table 

  

financial instrumen ts 

  

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and commodity price swaps

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps currency swaps commodity price swaps and forward and option contracts however the company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments the company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties 

  

foreign exchange rates risk 

  

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions 3m is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign 

 

  

currencies these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges 3m may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction beginning in the second quarter of 2014 3m began extending the maximum length of time over which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions from a previous term of 12 months to a longer term of 24 months with certain currencies being extended further to 36 months starting in the first quarter of 2015 in addition 3m enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing transactions as circumstances warrant the company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the company’s net investments in foreign operations the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges and those not designated as hedging instruments were 32 billion and 57 billion respectively at december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016 the company had 150 million euros and 248 billion south korean won in notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges along with 44 billion euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as nonderivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in note 12 in the “net investment hedges” section 

  

interest rates risk 

  

the company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances 3m manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt in addition the company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the dollar equivalent based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates gross notional amount of the company’s interest rate swaps at december 31 2016 was 20 billion additional details about 3m’s longterm debt can be found in note 10 including references to information regarding derivatives andor hedging instruments associated with the company’s longterm debt 

  

commodity prices risk 

  

the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and commodity price swaps 3m used commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions to manage price volatility but discontinued this practice in the first quarter of 2015 the related marktomarket gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings the company may enter into other commodity price swaps to offset in part fluctuation and costs associated with the use of certain commodities and precious metals these instruments are not designated in hedged relationships and the extent to which they were outstanding at december 31 2016 was not material 

  

 

  

value at risk 

  

the value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the company’s sensitivity to changes in currency rates interest rates and commodity prices a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on aftertax earnings related to financial instruments primarily debt derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2016 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12month time horizon the exposure to changes in currency rates model used 18 currencies interest rates related to three currencies and commodity prices related to five commodities this model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures 

  



  

in addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange rates recent historical information is as follows 3m estimates that yearonyear currency effects including hedging impacts had the following effects on pretax income 2016 127 million decrease and 2015 390 million decrease this estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into us dollars the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks 3m estimates that yearonyear derivative and other transaction gains and losses had the following effects on pretax income 2016 69 million decrease and 2015 180 million increase 

  

an analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each yearend a one percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 70 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 40 million per year global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3m production and other facilities primarily electricity and natural gas

the company completed implementation with respect to elements of certain processessubprocesses in limited subsidiarieslocations and will continue to rollout the erp system over the next several years as with any new information technology application we implement this application along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process was appropriately considered within the testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances we concluded as part of our evaluation described in the above paragraphs that the implementation of erp in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting

raw materials 

  

in 2015  the company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel  due largely to the significant price decreases in crude oil  this in turn dr ove yearonyear cost decreases in many feedstock categories including petroleum based materials minerals metals and wood pulp based products to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward contracts 

  

environmental law compliance 

  

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to “environmental matters and litigation” in note 1 4  commitments and contingencies 

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies the company’s commitment to a plan of action or approval by regulatory agencies environmental expenditures for capital 

 

  

projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2015  3m expended about  26 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues which are expensed capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s emphasis on environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be about 51 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 

  

while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements

 item 1a risk factor s 

  

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii   item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

  

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic  political and capital markets conditions the company operates in more than 70 countries and   derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as slower economic growth disruptions in financial markets economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary 

 

  

conditions inflation elevated unemployment levels sluggish or uneven recovery government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the company or its customers and suppliers or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates tax rates tax laws or exchange control ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

 change in t he company’s credit ratings could increase cost of fund ing    the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital    the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m the company has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa3 credit rating with a negative outlook from moody’s investors service this evaluation is based on a number of factors which includ e financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting the company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders the company’s ongoing transition to a more optimized capital structure financed with additional lowcost debt could impact 3m’s credit rating in the future failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the company’s cost of fund ing and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets 

  

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately 60 percent of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions 

 

  

future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma   and engages in ongoing global business transformation  business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internalexternal service delivery across 3m to move to more efficient business model s to improve operational efficiency and productivity while allowing 3m to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency this is enabled by the ongoing multiyear phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system on a worldwide basis    there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

  

 the company employs information technology systems to support its business including ongoing phased implementation of an erp system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations compromise information belonging to the company and its customers  suppliers  and employees exposing the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation in the ordinary course of business the company relies on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally the company collects and stores certain data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems which are continuously reviewed and upgraded the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures service providers including cloud services natural disasters or other catastrophic events it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period up to and including several years while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats to the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure none of them to date has had a material impact to the company there may be other challenges and risks as the company upgrades and standardizes its erp system on a worldwide basis any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business although the company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured 

  

 the companys defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results the performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the companys funding obligations under its defined benefit plans significant changes in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets and relevant legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the companys funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks including those involving product liability antitrust intellectual property environmental the us foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery anticorruption or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 1 4 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements

operating income margin 



  

operating income margins were 229 percent in 2015 compared to 224 percent in 2014 an increase of 05 percentage points these results included a significant benefit from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs and a benefit from productivity and other items these benefits w ere partially offset by higher pension and postretirement benefit costs 2015 restructuring charges higher strategic investments and acquisition and divestiture impacts strategic investments include in cremental programs around disruptive rd and business transformation acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the capital safety and polypore separations media acquisitions and the divestitures of substantially all of the l ibrary s ystems business  along with the license plate converting business in france

interest expense and income 



  

interest expense  interest expense increased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014 despite significantly higher debt levels helped by lower average interest rates interest expense   decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 again despite higher debt levels primarily due to lower us borrowing costs as debt maturities were replaced with lower cost financing from commercial paper and lower interest rates on new debt issuances 

  

capitalized interest related to property plant and equipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense the amounts shown in the table above for interest expense are net of capitalized interest amounts of  13 million  15 million and 2 1 million in 201 5  201 4 and 201 3  respectively 

  

 

  

interest income   interest income in 2015 was lower when compared to 2014 due to lower average cashmarketable securities balances interest income in 2014 was lower when compared to 2013 due to lower cash balances 

  

provision for income taxes 



  

the effective tax rate for 2015 was 291 percent compared to 289 percent in 2014 an increase of 02 percentage points the effective tax rate for 2014 was 289 percent compared to 281 percent in 2013 an increase of 08 percentage points the changes in the rates between years are impacted by many factors as described further in note 8 

  

the company currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2016 will be approximately 295 to 305 percent the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes

net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 

  



  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non3m ownership interests in 3m consolidated entities the changes in noncontrolling interest amounts have largely related to sumitomo 3m limited japan which was 3m’s most significant consolidated entity with non3m ownership interests as discussed in note 6  on september   1 2014 3m purchased the remaining 25 percent ownership in sumitomo 3m limited bringing 3m’s ownership to 100 percent thus effective september   1 2014 net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was significantly reduced the primary remaining noncontrolling interest relates to 3m india limited of which 3m’s effective ownership is 75 percent 

  

currency effects 

  

3m estimates that yearonyear currency effects including hedging impacts decreased pretax income   by approximately 390 million and  100 million in 201 5 and 201 4  respectively these estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into us dollars the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping venezuelan bolivars into us dollars 3m estimates that yearonyear derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased pretax income by approximately  180 million and 10 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively refer to note 1 2 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning 3m’s hedging activities

critical accounting estimates 

  

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors

pension and postretirement obligations 

  

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the primary us definedbenefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january 1 2009 the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 715 compensation — retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date see note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination the benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date the company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the december 31 measurement date using the yields of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits historically the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan ’ s benefit obligation was also used for the calculation of all net periodic benefit costs including the measurement of the service and interest costs beginning in 2016 3m change d the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs the new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service costs are determined based on durationspecific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows the interest cost calculation is determined by applying durationspecific spot rates to the yearbyyear projected benefit payments the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income the company chang ed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates the company account ed for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the change to the spot yield curve approach 2016 defined benefit pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease by 180 million including this 180 million 3m expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 before settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other to decrease by approximately 320 million pretax when compared to 2015 

  

using this methodology the company determined discount rates for its plans as follow 



  

a nother significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2016 is 750 025 lower than 2015 refer to note 11 for information on how the 2015 rate was determined return on assets assumptions for 

 

  

international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 577 for 2016 compared to 590 for 2015 

  

for the year ended december 31 2015 the company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense after settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other of 55 6 million up from 391 million in 2014 defined benefit pension and postretirement expense before settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other is anticipated to decrease to approximately  236 million in 2016 a decrease of 320 million compared to 2015 

  

the table below summarizes the impact on 2016 pension expense for the us and international pension plans of a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2016 net periodic benefit cost the table assumes all other factors are held constant including the slope of the discount rate yield curves 



  

asset impairments 

  

as of december 31 2015  net property plant and equipment totaled 85 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled  26 billion management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately  92 billion as of december 31 2015  3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units generally correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 

  

an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for   the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses in addition to businesses where the priceearnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted 3m also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 

  

as described in note 16 effective in the third quarter of 2015 within the health care business segment the company formed the oral care solutions division which combined the former 3m espe and 3m unitek divisions for any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units during the third quarter of 201 5  the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 201 5 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time 

  

as of october 1 2015 3m had 26 primary reporting units with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 87 percent of the goodwill these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions 3m p urification which 

 

  

includes the polypore separations media acquisition advanced materials communication markets display materials and systems health information systems industrial adhesives and tapes infection prevention oral care solutions personal safety which includes the capital safety acquisition and traffic safety and security the estimated fair values for these reporting units were in excess of carrying value by approximately 50 percent or more except for one reporting unit with approximately 300 million of goodwill where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 30 percent 3m’s market value at both september 30 2015 and december 31 2015 was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately 12 billion at both december 31 2015 and september 30 2015 

  

in 2015 3m primarily used an industry priceearnings ratio approach but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units to determine fair values where applicable 3m used a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring 

  

3m is an integrated materials enterprise thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2015 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units 

  

factors which could result in future impairment charges include among others changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document in addition changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results as indi cated above during the third quarter of 201 5  the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed longlived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable if future noncash asset impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 201 6 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

  

income taxes 

  

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 8 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

financial condition and liquidity 

  

3m continues its transition to a betteroptimized capital structure and is adding leverage at a measured pace the strength and stability of 3ms business model and strong free cash flow capability together with proven capital markets access enable the company to implement this strategy investing in 3m’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority thus 3m will continue to deploy capital towards research and development capital expenditures and commercialization capability investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions 3m will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases sources for cash availability in the united states such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases as well as funding us acquisitions and other items as needed for those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely the company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for us operations however if these international funds are needed for operations in the us 3m would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate them see note 8 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

  

3m’s primary shortterm liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and us commercial paper issuances the company believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market 3m’s commercial paper program permits the company to have a maximum of 3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance 

  

net debt 

  

the company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 3m considers net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy net debt is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the following table provides net debt as of december 31 2015 and 2014  

  



  

in 2015 net debt rose by 54 billion to a net debt balance of 89 billion as of december 31 2015 as 3m progressed on its capital structure strategy  de bt levels were higher in both the us and internationally  while international cash and marketable securities balances were reduced  specific actions related to cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in addition to debt are discussed further below 

  

cash c ash e quivalents and m arketable s ecurities 

  

at december 31 2015  3m had  19 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of which approximately 17 billion was held by the company’s foreign subsidiaries and 200 million was hel d by the united states of the  17 billion held internationally us dollarbased cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 355 million  or 21 percent which was invested in money market funds assetbacked securities agency securities corporate mediumterm note securities and other high quality fixed income securities at december 31 2014  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the company’s foreign subsidiaries and in the united states totaled approximately  3 3 billion and less than 100 million respectively 

  

the company’s total balance of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 14 billion lower at december 31 2015 when compared to december 31 2014  3m was able to manage the business with lower cash levels due to significant ongoing cash flow generation and proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles 

  

 

  

total d ebt 

  

the company’s total debt was  40 billion higher at december 31 2015 when compared to december 31 2014  the strength of 3m’s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3m proven access to capital markets additionally the company’s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio t he company has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard    poor’s and an aa3 credit rating with a negative outlook from moody’s investors service the company’s ongoing transition to a better optimized capital structure financed with additional lowcost debt could impact 3m’s credit rating in the future 

  

effective may   16 2014 the company updated its “wellknown seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales this replaced 3m’s previous shelf registration dated august   5 2011 in june   2014 in connection with the may   16 2014 shelf registration 3m recommenced its mediumterm notes program series   f under which 3m may issue from time to time up to 9 billion aggregate principal amount of notes  included in this 9 billion are  817 billion utilizing the foreign exchange rate applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt of notes previously issued in 2011  2012 2014 and 2015 as part of series f   information with respect to longterm debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in note 10

various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled  3868 billion at december   31 201 5  compared with  6339 billion at december 31 201 4 a de crease of  2471 b illion current asset balance changes decreased working capital by  1317 b illion driven by decreases in marketable securities current liability balance changes de creased working capital by 1 154 billion driven by   in creases in shortterm debt 

  

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index which includes accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable this combined index defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at yearend — multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable was 49 at december 31 2015 compared to 50 at december 31 2014  receivables decreased  84 million or 20 percent compared with december 31 2014  as   c urrency translation impacts decreased accounts receivable by 2 39 million  partially offset by 2015 acquisitions that added 103 million  inventories decreased 1 8 8 million or 5 1 percent compared with december 31 2014  the inventory decrease was attributable to currency translation which decreased inventories by 27 2 million partially offset by 2015 acquisitions that added 102 million  

 

  

accounts payable decreased by 113 million compared with december 31 2014 as currency translation impacts reduced accounts payable by 76 million

cash flows from operating activities 

  



  

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows 

  

in 2015 cash flows provided by operating activities decreased 206 million compared to 2014 operating cash flows decreased due to  363 million in higher cash income taxes when comparing 2015 to 2014 plus lower net income which was partially offset by lower yearonyear working capital requirements the combination of accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by 46 million in   2015  compared to increases of  306 million in 2014  with the yearonyear improvement related to lower organic volume growth additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “financial condition and liquidity” section 

  

in 2014  cash flows provided by operating activities increased 809 million compared to 2013  operating cash flows benefited yearonyear from increases in net income including noncontrolling interest lower pension and postretirement plans contributions and lower yearonyear working capital requirements the combination of accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by 306 million in 2014  compared to increases of 407 million in 2013  with the yearonyear improvement partially due to higher receivable and inventory turns  additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “financial condition and liquidity” section 

 

  

  

free cash flow nongaap measure 

  

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities 3m believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are useful measures of performance and uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap therefore they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 3m defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment which is classified as an investing activity it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures 3m defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3m below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2015  2014 and 2013

longterm debt payments due in 2016 and 2017 include floating rate notes totaling 126 million classified as current portion of longterm debt and 96 million included as a separate floating rate note in the longterm debt table respectively as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments  interest projections on both floating and fixed rate longterm debt including the effects of interest rate swaps are based on effective interest rates as of december 31 2015  

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2016 and beyond the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

other obligations included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc 740 which is expected to be paid   out in cash in the next 12 months the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the longterm portion of the net tax liability of  208 million is excluded from the preceding table refer to note 8 for further details 

  

as discussed in note 1 1  the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 201 6 and company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps currency swaps commodity price swaps and forward and option contracts however the company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments the company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties 

  

foreign exchange rates risk 

  

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions 3m is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges 3m may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction beginning in the second quarter of 2014  3m began extending the maximum length of time over which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions from a previous term of 12 months to a longer term of 24 months  with certain currencies being extended further to 36 months starting in the first quarter of 2015 in addition 3m enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing transactions as circumstances warrant the company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the company’s net investments in foreign operations the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges and those not designated as hedging instruments were  28 billion and  54 billion respectively at december 31 2015  as of december 31 2015  the company had 974 million euros and 248 billion south korean won in notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges along with 36 billio n euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as nonderivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in note 1 2 in the “net investment hedges” section 

  

interest rates risk

commodity prices risk 

  

the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward contracts 3m used commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions to manage price volatility but discontinued this practice in the first quarter of 2015 the related marktomarket gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings 

  

value at risk 

  

the value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the company’s   sensitivity to changes in currency rates interest rates and commodity prices  a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on aftertax earnings related to f inancial instruments primarily debt derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2015  the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12month time horizon the exposure to changes in currency rates model used 18 currencies interest rates related to three currencies and commodity prices related to five commodities this model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results   the risk of loss or benefit associated with exchange rates was higher in 2015 due to a greater mix of floating rate debt and a rising interest rate environment in the us interest rate volatility increased in 2015 based on a higher mix of floating rate debt and the use of forward rates the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures 

  



  

in addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange rates recent historical information is as follows 3m estimates that yearonyear currency effects including hedging impacts had the following effects on pretax income 2015  390   million decrease and 2014  100 million decrease this estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into us dollars the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping venezuelan bolivars into us dollars 3m estimates that yearonyear derivative and other transaction gains and losses had the following effects on pretax income 2015  180   million increase and   2014  10 million in crease 

  

an analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each yearend a one percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately  70 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately  40 million per year global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3m production and other facilities primarily electricity and natural gas

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

  

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic and capital markets conditions the company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately twothirds of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business is subject to global competition and may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as disruptions in financial markets economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions elevated unemployment levels sluggish or uneven recovery in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions natural and other disasters affecting the operations of the company or its customers and suppliers or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates tax rates or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

 the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m as of february 2015 the company has an aa credit rating with 

  

  

a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa3 credit rating with a negative outlook from moody’s investors service this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting the company’s credit ratings have facilitated lower borrowing costs and access to a variety of lenders 3m’s ongoing transition to a more optimized capital structure financed with additional lowcost debt could impact 3m’s credit rating in the future failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the company’s cost of funds and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets 

  

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately twothirds of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

  

 the company employs information technology systems to support its business including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system on a worldwide basis over the next several years security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations compromise information belonging to the company and its customers and suppliers and expose the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation in the ordinary course of business the company relies on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally the company collects and stores certain data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and third 

  

  

party training monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems which are continuously reviewed and upgraded the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period up to and including several years while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats to the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure none of them to date has had a material impact to the company there may be other challenges and risks as the company upgrades and standardizes its erp system on a worldwide basis any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business although the company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks including those involving product liability antitrust intellectual property environmental the us foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery anticorruption or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 13 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements

pension and postretirement defined benefit plans 

  

on a worldwide basis 3m’s pension and postretirement plans were 85 percent funded at yearend 2014 the primary us qualified pension plan which is approximately 68 percent of the worldwide pension obligation was 92 percent funded and the international pension plans were 85 percent funded the us nonqualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors asset returns in 2014 for the primary us qualified pension plan was 130 as 3m strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2015 is 775 unchanged from 2014 the primary us qualified pension plan yearend 2014 discount rate was 410 down 088 percentage points from the yearend 2013 discount rate of 498 the decrease in us discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation which decreased the plans’ funded status additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in note 10 pension and postretirement benefit plans

provision for income taxes

the effective tax rate for 2013 was 281 percent compared to 290 percent in 2012 a decrease of 09 percentage points impacted by many factors factors that decreased the company’s effective tax rate included international taxes as a 

  

  

result of changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes the reinstatement of the us research and development credit in 2013 an increase in the domestic manufacturer’s deduction benefit the restoration of tax basis on certain assets for which depreciation deductions were previously limited and other items combined these factors decreased the company’s effective tax rate by 40 percentage points this benefit was partially offset by factors that increased the effective tax rate by 31 percentage points which largely related to increases in 3m’s income tax reserves for 2013 when compared to 2012 

  

the company currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2015 will be approximately 280 to 290 percent which assumes that the us research and development credit will be reinstated for 2015 the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes

critical accounting estimates 

  

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

legal proceedings 

  

the categories of claims for which the company has a probable and estimable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 13 for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

  

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the primary us definedbenefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january 1 2009 the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 715 compensation — retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc 715 

  

  

requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and liability measurement see note 10 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits using this methodology the company determined a discount rate of 410 for the primary us qualified pension plan and 407 for us postretirement plans to be appropriate as of december 31 2014 which represents a decrease from the 498 and 483 rates respectively used as of december 31 2013 the weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of december 31 2014 was 311 a decrease from the 402 rate used as of december 31 2013 

  

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2015 is 775 unchanged from 2013 refer to note 10 for information on how the 2014 rate was determined return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 590 for 2015 compared to 583 for 2014 

  

for the year ended december 31 2014 the company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense after settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other of 391 million down from 553 million in 2013 defined benefit pension and postretirement expense before settlements curtailments special termination benefits and other is anticipated to increase to 601 million in 2015 an increase of 210 million compared to 2014 for the pension plans holding all other factors constant a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would decreaseincrease 2015 pension expense by approximately 34 million for us pension plans and approximately 15 million for international pension plans also holding all other factors constant a 025 percentage point increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would decrease 2015 pension expense by approximately 33 million for us pension plans and approximately 24 million for international pension plans in addition a 025 percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would increase 2015 pension expense by approximately 34 million for us pension plans and approximately 26 million for international pension plans 

  

asset impairments 

  

as of december 31 2014 net property plant and equipment totaled 85 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled 14 billion management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 71 billion as of december 31 2014 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units generally correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 

  

an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for 

  

  

the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 

  

as discussed in notes 3 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements effective in the first quarter of 2014 3m transferred a product line between divisions within business segments and in the first second and fourth quarters of 2014 also made certain changes within business segments in its continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers concurrent with these business segment changes certain products were moved between and within business segments for any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units during the first second and fourth quarters of 2014 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2014 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time 

  

as of october 1 2014 3m had 27 primary reporting units with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 81 percent of the goodwill these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions 3m espe 3m purification inc advanced materials communication markets display materials and systems health information systems industrial adhesives and tapes infection prevention personal safety and traffic safety and security systems the estimated fair values for all significant reporting units were in excess of carrying value by approximately 50 percent or more 3m’s market value at both september 30 2014 and december 31 2014 was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately 16 billion and 13 billion respectively 

  

in 2014 3m primarily used an industry priceearnings ratio approach but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units to determine fair values where applicable 3m used a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring 

  

3m is an integrated materials enterprise thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2014 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units 

  

factors which could result in future impairment charges include among others changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document in addition changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results as indicated above during the first second and fourth quarters of 2014 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by product moves plus other changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed longlived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable if future noncash asset impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2015 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

  

income taxes 

  

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 7 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of 

  

  

these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

financial condition and liquidity 

  

3m continues to manage towards a betteroptimized capital structure by adding balance sheet leverage which is being used for two purposes first to invest in 3m’s businesses and second to increase cash returns to shareholders the strength and stability of 3m’s business model and strong free cash flow capability together with proven capital markets access enables 3m to implement this strategy while continuing to invest in its businesses organic growth remains a high priority thus 3m will continue to invest in research and development capital expenditures and commercialization capability in addition sources for cash availability in the united states such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases as well as funding us acquisitions and other items as needed for those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely the company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for us operations however if these international funds are needed for operations in the us 3m would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate them see note 7 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

  

3m’s primary shortterm liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and us commercial paper issuances 3m resumed commercial paper funding in july 2013 for the first time since late 2008 3m expects to maintain a consistent presence in the market and believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market 3m’s commercial paper program permits the company to have a maximum of 3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance 

  

net debt 

  

the company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash cash equivalents and current and longterm marketable securities 3m considers net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy net debt is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the following table provides net debt as of december 31 2014 and 2013 

  

   

in 2014 net debt increased by 23 billion to a net debt balance of 35 billion as of december 31 2014 as 3m progressed on its capital structure strategy and experienced higher debt levels and lower cash balances in both the us and internationally specific actions related to cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in addition to debt are discussed further below 

  

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

  

at december 31 2014 3m had 34 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of which approximately 33 billion was held by the company’s foreign subsidiaries and less than 100 million was held by the united states of the 33 billion held internationally us dollarbased cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 19 billion or 58 percent which was invested in money market funds assetbacked securities agency securities corporate mediumterm note securities and other high quality fixed income securities at december 31 2013 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the company’s foreign subsidiaries and in the united states totaled approximately 43 billion and 05 billion respectively 

  

  

the company’s total balance of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 14 billion lower at december 31 2014 when compared to december 31 2013 3m was able to manage the business with lower cash levels particularly in the us due to significant ongoing cash flow generation and proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles 

  

total debt 

  

the company’s total debt was 08 billion higher at december 31 2014 when compared to december 31 2013 the strength of 3m’s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3m proven access to capital markets additionally the company’s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio as of february 2015 the company has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa3 credit rating with a negative outlook from moody’s investors service the company’s ongoing transition to a more optimized capital structure financed with additional lowcost debt could impact 3m’s credit rating in the future 

  

effective may 16 2014 the company updated its “wellknown seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales this replaced 3m’s previous shelf registration dated august 5 2011 in june 2014 in connection with the may 16 2014 shelf registration 3m recommenced its mediumterm notes program series f under which 3m may issue from time to time up to 9 billion aggregate principal amount of notes included in this 9 billion are 225 billion of notes previously issued in 2011 and 2012 as part of series f

balance sheet 

  

3m’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth including continual review of acquisition opportunities 

  

  

various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled 5767 billion at december 31 2014 compared with 5235 billion at december 31 2013 an increase of 532 million current asset balance changes decreased working capital by 968 million driven by decreases in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities plus inventory decreases current liability balance changes increased working capital by 15 billion largely due to decreases in shortterm debt 

  

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index which includes accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable this combined index defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at yearend — multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable was 50 at december 31 2014 compared to 48 at december 31 2013 receivables decreased 15 million or 04 percent compared with december 31 2013 with higher december 2014 sales compared to december 2013 sales contributing to this increase currency translation impacts decreased accounts receivable by 292 million inventories decreased 158 million or 41 percent compared with december 31 2013 the inventory decrease was attributable to currency translation which decreased inventories by 271 million partially offset by an increase in demand accounts payable had a minimal change when compared with december 31 2013 

  

return on invested capital nongaap measure 

  

the company uses nongaap measures to focus on shareholder value creation 3m uses return on invested capital roic defined as annualized aftertax operating income including interest income divided by average operating capital operating capital is defined as net assets total assets less total liabilities excluding debt this measure is not recognized under us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies roic was 220 percent for 2014 and 200 percent for 2013 

  

cash flows 

  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents which are presented separately in the cash flows thus the amounts presented in the following operating investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects 

  

  

cash flows from operating activities 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows

free cash flow nongaap measure 

  

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities 3m believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are useful measures of performance and uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap therefore they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 3m defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment which is classified as an investing activity it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures 3m defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3m below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2014 2013 and 2012

as of december 31 2014 the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements refer to the section entitled “warrantiesguarantees” in note 13 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 follows 

  

contractual obligations 

  

   

longterm debt payments due in 2015 2016 and 2017 include floating rate notes totaling 55 million classified as current portion of longterm debt 71 million included in other borrowings in the longterm debt table and 96 million included as a separate floating rate note in the longterm debt table respectively as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments interest projections on both floating and fixed rate longterm debt including the effects of interest rate swaps are based on effective interest rates as of december 31 2014 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2014 and beyond the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

other obligations included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc 740 which is expected to be paid 

  

  

out in cash in the next 12 months the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the longterm portion of the net tax liability of 262 million is excluded from the preceding table refer to note 7 for further details 

  

as discussed in note 10 the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2015 and company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table 

  

financial instruments 

  

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward contracts 

  

refer to item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk interest rates risk commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the context of item 7a 3m is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities determines certain of the company’s financial risk policies and objectives and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation risk analysis counterparty credit approval and ongoing monitoring and reporting 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps currency swaps commodity price swaps and forward and option contracts however the company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments the company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions 3m is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges 3m may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction beginning in the second quarter of 2014 3m began extending the maximum length of time over which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions from a previous term of 12 months to a longer term of 24 months in addition 3m enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing transactions as circumstances warrant the company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the company’s net investments in foreign operations the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges and those not designated as hedging instruments were 22 billion and 66 billion respectively at december 31 2014 as of december 31 2014 the company had 200 million euros in notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges along with 185 billion euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as nonderivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in note 11 in the “net investment hedges” section 

  

interest rates risk 

  

the company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances 3m manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the dollar equivalent based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates gross notional amount of the company’s interest rate swaps at december 31 2014 was 1 billion additional details about 3m’s longterm debt can be found in note 9 including references to information regarding derivatives andor hedging instruments associated with the company’s longterm debt 

  

commodity prices risk 

  

certain commodities the company uses in the production of its products are exposed to market price risks 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward contracts the company uses commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions to manage price volatility generally the length of time over which 3m hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for its forecasted transactions is 12 months 3m also enters into commodity price swaps that are not designated in hedge relationships to offset in part the impacts of fluctuations in costs associated with the use of certain commodities and precious metals 

  

the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s commodity price swaps designated as cash flow hedges and commodity price swaps not designated in hedge relationships were 20 million and 2 million respectively at december 31 2014 

  

  

value at risk 

  

the value at risk analysis is performed annually a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency rates interest rates and commodity prices and assess the risk of loss or benefit in aftertax earnings of financial instruments primarily debt derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2014 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12month time horizon the exposure to changes in currency rates model used 18 currencies interest rates related to three currencies four in 2013 and commodity prices related to five commodities this model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results 3m changed to a different thirdparty bank dataset in 2014 and have revised 2013 amounts to reflect this change foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased in 2014 primarily due to increases in exposures which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model interest rate volatility remained stable in 2014 because the majority of 3m’s debt is fixed and interest rates are currently very low and are projected to remain low based on forward rates the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures 

  

   

in addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange rates recent historical information is as follows 3m estimates that yearonyear currency effects including hedging impacts had the following effects on net income attributable to 3m 2014 97 million decrease and 2013 74 million decrease this estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into us dollars the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping venezuelan bolivars into us dollars 3m estimates that yearonyear derivative and other transaction gains and losses had the following effects on net income attributable to 3m 2014 8 million increase and 2013 12 million decrease 

  

an analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each yearend a one percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 80 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 47 million per year global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3m production and other facilities primarily electricity and natural gas

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to “environmental matters and litigation” in note 13 commitments and contingencies 

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2013 3m expended about 31 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues which are expensed capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s policies stressing environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be about 54 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions

 item 1a risk factors 

  

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

  

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic and capital markets conditions the company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately twothirds of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business is subject to global competition and may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as disruptions in financial markets economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions elevated unemployment levels sluggish or uneven recovery in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions natural and other disasters affecting the operations of the company or its customers and suppliers or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates tax rates or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

 the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m the company currently has an aa credit rating with a stable 

  

  

outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting the company’s current ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the company’s cost of funds and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets 

  

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately twothirds of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company

december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 3m has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service the company has significant cash on hand and sufficient additional access to capital markets to meet its funding needs 

  

in 2013 the company experienced stable to declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel this was driven by yearonyear cost decreases in many feedstock categories including petroleum based materials minerals metals and wood pulp based products to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

on a worldwide basis 3m’s pension and postretirement plans were 94 percent funded at yearend 2013 the primary us qualified plan which is approximately 66 percent of the worldwide pension obligation was 103 percent funded and the international pension plans were 91 percent funded the us nonqualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors asset returns in 2013 for the primary us qualified plan was 602 as 3m strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status which improved to 103 percent funded at yearend 2013 compared to 96 percent funded at yearend 2012 for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2014 is 775 a decrease of 025 percentage points from 2013 the primary us qualified plan yearend 2013 discount rate was 498 up 084 percentage points from the yearend 2012 discount rate of 414 the increase in us discount rates resulted in a lower valuation of the projected benefit obligation which improved the plans’ funded status the changes in 3m’s defined benefit plans’ funded status significantly impacted several balance sheet amounts in the fourthquarter of 2013 these required annual measurements increased stockholders’ equity by 09 billion decreased pension and postretirement benefits’ longterm liabilities by 08 billion increased prepaid pension benefits’ assets by 05 billion and decreased deferred taxes within other assets by 04 billion other pension and postretirement changes during the year such as contributions and amortization also impacted these balance sheet amounts 

  

3m expects to contribute approximately 100 million to 200 million of cash to its global pension and postretirement plans in 2014 the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2014 3m expects defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2014 to decrease by approximately 160 million pretax when compared to 2013 the change in both defined benefit and defined contribution plan expenses would increase earnings per share in 2014 by approximately 15 cents per share when compared to 2013 or approximately 17 cents per share including the impact of defined benefit plan expenses only refer to “critical accounting estimates” within mda and note 10 pension and postretirement benefit plans for additional information concerning 3m’s pension and postretirement plans in addition 3m currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2014 will be approximately 280 to 290 percent compared to 281 percent for 2013

worldwide selling prices rose 09 percent in 2013 and 14 percent in 2012 selling price increases were driven by two primary factors in both 2013 and 2012 first investment in research and development continues to support a strong pricevalue equation in many of the markets that 3m serves second 3m adjusts selling prices to offset currency devaluations in certain developing countries these increases have more than offset selling price declines in 3m’s optical systems business where prices typically decline each year which is common for the electronics industry

cost of sales includes manufacturing engineering and freight costs 

  

cost of sales measured as a percent of net sales was 521 percent in 2013 a decrease of 03 percentage points from 2012 cost of sales as a percent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases as selling prices rose 09 percent and raw material cost deflation was approximately 2 percent favorable yearonyear in addition lower pension and postretirement costs of which a portion impacts cost of sales in addition to organic volume increases decreased cost of sales as a percent of sales these benefits were partially offset by the impact of 2012 acquisitions and lower factory utilization 

  

cost of sales measured as a percent of net sales was 524 percent in 2012 a decrease of 06 percentage points from 2011 the net impact of selling priceraw material cost changes was the primary factor that decreased cost of sales as a percent of sales as selling prices increased 14 percent and raw material costs decreased approximately 2 percent this benefit was partially offset by higher pension and postretirement costs 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

selling general and administrative expenses sga increased 282 million or 46 percent in 2013 when compared to 2012 in 2013 sga included strategic investments in business transformation enabled by 3m’s global enterprise resource planning erp implementation in addition to increases from acquired businesses that were largely not in 3m’s 2012 spending ceradyne inc and federal signal technologies which were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement expense sga measured as a percent of sales increased 03 percentage points to 207 percent in 2013 compared to 204 percent in 2012 

  

sga decreased 68 million or 11 percent in 2012 when compared to 2011 in addition to costcontrol and other productivity efforts 3m experienced some savings from its firstquarter 2012 voluntary early retirement incentive program and other restructuring actions these benefits more than offset increases related to acquisitions higher yearonyear pension and postretirement expense and restructuring expenses sga in 2012 included increases from acquired businesses which were not in 3m’s fullyear 2011 base spending primarily related to the 2011 acquisitions of winterthur technologie ag and the doityourself and professional business of gpi group in addition to sga spending related to the 2012 acquisitions of ceradyne inc federal signal technologies group and coderyte inc sga measured as a percent of sales was 204 percent in 2012 a decrease of 04 percentage points when compared to 2011 

  

research development and related expenses 

  

research development and related expenses rd increased 49 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased 41 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 as 3m continued to support its key growth initiatives including more rd aimed at disruptive innovation in 2013 increases from acquired businesses that were largely not in 3m’s 2012 spending primarily ceradyne inc and federal signal technologies were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement expense in 

  

  

2012 investments to support key growth initiatives along with higher pension and postretirement expense were partially offset by costcontrol efforts and savings from 3m’s firstquarter 2012 voluntary early retirement incentive program rd measured as a percent of sales was 56 percent in 2013 compared to 55 percent in 2012 and 53 percent in 2011 

  

operating income 

  

3m uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools 

  

operating income margins were 216 percent in 2013 compared to 217 in 2012 a decrease of 01 percentage points items that reduced operating income margins included a 05 percentage point impact from lower factory utilizationproductivity along with a 04 percentage point impact from the combination of business transformation enabled by 3m’s global erp implementation along with more rd aimed at disruptive innovation the recently enacted medical device excise tax in the us foreign currency effects acquisition impacts and other net impacts reduced operating income margins by 07 percentage points these factors were largely offset by items that increased operating income margins which included a 12 percentage point benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases finally lower pensionpostretirement benefit costs increased operating income margins by 03 percentage points 

  

operating income was 217 percent of sales in 2012 compared to 209 percent of sales in 2011 an improvement of 08 percentage points the improvement was driven by a 16 percentage point benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases this was partially offset by increased pensionpostretirement benefit costs and acquisition impacts each of which reduced margins by 03 percentage points and other net impacts which decreased margins by 02 percentage points 

  

interest expense and income 

  

   

interest expense  interest expense decreased in both 2013 and 2012 the 2013 decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates the 2012 decrease was driven by lower average international debt balances and lower interest rates on us debt 

  

interest income interest income was up 2 million when comparing 2013 to 2012 as higher average international cash balances were largely offset by lower average us balances and lower us and international interest rates in 2012 lower us cash balances and lower interest rates internationally were offset by higher international cash balances and higher interest rates in the us 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

   

the effective tax rate for 2013 was 281 percent compared to 290 percent in 2012 a decrease of 09 percentage points impacted by many factors factors that decreased the company’s effective tax rate included international taxes as a result of changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes the reinstatement of the us research and development credit in 2013 an increase in the domestic manufacturer’s deduction benefit the restoration of tax basis on certain assets for which depreciation deductions were previously limited and other items combined these factors decreased the company’s effective tax rate by 40 percentage points this benefit was partially offset by factors that increased the effective tax rate by 31 percentage points which largely related to adjustments to 3m’s income tax reserves for 2013 when compared to 2012 

  

the effective tax rate for 2012 was 290 percent compared to 278 percent in 2011 an increase of 12 percentage points impacted by many factors the primary factors that increased the company’s effective tax rate yearonyear include international taxes specifically with respect to the corporate reorganization of a wholly owned international subsidiary which benefited 2011 state income taxes lower domestic manufacturer’s deduction and the lapse of the us research and development credit these and other factors when compared to 2011 increased the 2012 effective tax rate by 21 percentage points factors that decreased the company’s effective tax rate yearonyear include international taxes as a 

  

  

result of changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes and adjustments to its income tax reserves these factors when compared to 2011 decreased the effective tax rate 09 percentage points 

  

the company currently expects that its effective tax rate for total year 2014 will be approximately 280 to 290 percent the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes

performance by business segment 

  

disclosures relating to 3m’s business segments are provided in item 1 business segments financial information and other disclosures are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as discussed in note 15 effective in the first quarter of 2013 the company completed a realignment of its business segments to better serve global markets and customers segment information presented herein reflects the impacts of these changes for all periods presented the reportable segments are industrial safety and graphics electronics and energy health care and consumer information related to 3m’s business segments is presented in the tables that follow organic localcurrency sales include both organic volume impacts plus selling price impacts acquisition impacts if any are measured separately for the first twelve months of the acquisition the divestiture impacts if any foreign currency translation impacts and total sales change are also provided for each business segment any references to emea relate to europe middle east and africa on a combined basis 

  

corporate and unallocated 

  

in addition to these five operating business segments 3m assigns certain costs to “corporate and unallocated” which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in note 15 corporate and unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items such as corporate investment gains and losses certain derivative gains and losses certain insurancerelated gains and losses certain litigation and environmental expenses corporate restructuring charges and certain under or overabsorbed costs eg pension stockbased compensation that the company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis 

  

corporate and unallocated operating expenses decreased by 149 million in 2013 when compared to 2012 of the 149 million decrease in 2013 approximately 127 million was due to lower pension and postretirement benefit expense the primary items driving the 51 million increase in corporate and unallocated in 2012 when compared to 2011 were pension and postretirement expense as a portion of the 2012 increase in these expenses were not allocated directly to the five operating business segments 63 million partially offset by an increase in other environmental insurance receivables which benefited 2012 by 15 million as discussed in note 13 

  

operating business segments 

  

all five business segments when comparing 2013 to 2012 were impacted by investments in business transformation which are enabled by 3m’s global erp implementation and by higher allocated pension and postretirement benefit expenses t he implementation of 3m’s erp system has increased spending in total and the transition of 3m’s erp system from the development stage into deployment has also resulted in more erp costs being borne by the five operating business segments rather than corporate and unallocated this negatively impacted each business segment’s annual 2013 operating income margins by approximately 030 percentage points when compared to 2012 3m’s pension and postretirement benefit expenses declined 97 million when comparing 2013 to 2012 however 127 million of this reduction was allocated to corporate and unallocated resulting in 30 million of additional expense being absorbed by the five operating business segments in 2013 or a negative yearonyear impact of approximately 010 percentage points thus while operating income margins have declined when comparing 2013 to 2012 for all five business segments on average approximately 040 percentage points of this decline relates to the impact of higher erp implementation expenses and higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses when comparing 2012 to 2011 operating business segment results reflect 32 million in higher yearonyear pension and postretirement benefit expenses

performance by geographic area 

  

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 16 as discussed in note 16 during the first quarter of 2013 3m realigned its geographic area structure to include puerto rico in the united states rather than in the latin americacanada region geographic area information presented herein reflects the impact of this change for all periods presented

critical accounting estimates 

  

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

  

legal proceedings 

  

the categories of claims for which the company has a probable and estimable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 13 for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

  

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the primary us definedbenefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january 1 2009 the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 715 compensation — retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and liability measurement see note 10 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits using this methodology the company determined a discount rate of 498 for the primary us qualified pension plan and 483 for us postretirement plans to be appropriate as of december 31 2013 which represents an increase from the 414 and 400 rates respectively used as of december 31 2012 the weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of december 31 2013 was 402 an increase from the 378 rate used as of december 31 2012 

  

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the primary us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2014 is 775 a 025 decrease from 2013 refer to note 10 for information on how the 2014 rate was determined return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 583 for 2014 compared to 587 for 2013 

  

for the year ended december 31 2013 the company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pretax pension and postretirement expense after settlements curtailments and special termination benefits of 553 million down from 650 million in 2012 defined benefit pension and postretirement expense before settlements curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to decrease to 393 million in 2014 a decrease of 160 million compared to 2013 for the pension plans holding all other factors constant a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would decreaseincrease 2014 pension expense by approximately 34 million for us pension plans and approximately 14 million for international pension plans also holding all other factors constant a 025 percentage point increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would decrease 2014 pension expense by approximately 41 million for us pension plans and approximately 21 million for international pension plans in addition a 025 percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would increase 2014 pension expense by approximately 42 million for us pension plans and approximately 24 million for international pension plans 

  

  

asset impairments 

  

as of december 31 2013 net property plant and equipment totaled 87 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled 17 billion management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 73 billion as of december 31 2013 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units generally correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 

  

an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 

  

as discussed in notes 3 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements effective in the first quarter of 2013 3m completed a realignment of its business segments concurrent with this business segment realignment certain products were also moved between business segments for any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units during the first quarter of 2013 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2013 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time 

  

as of september 30 2013 3m had 34 primary reporting units with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 80 percent of the goodwill these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions 3m purification inc personal safety optical systems traffic safety and security systems infection prevention 3m espe advanced materials industrial adhesives and tapes communication markets and health information systems the fair values for all significant reporting units were in excess of carrying value by 50 percent or more except for one reporting unit with approximately 300 million of goodwill where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 30 percent 

  

in 2013 3m primarily used an industry priceearnings ratio approach but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units to determine fair values where applicable 3m used a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring 

  

based on fourthquarter 2013 testing 3m’s estimated fair value when valuing each reporting unit individually would aggregate to approximately 94 billion implying a control premium of 17 percent when compared to 3m’s market value of approximately 80 billion at september 30 2013 the control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3m’s total company estimated fair value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total company 3m’s market value at both september 30 2013 and december 31 2013 was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately 18 billion 3m is an integrated materials enterprise thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2013 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units 

  

factors which could result in future impairment charges include among others changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document in addition changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results as indicated above during the first quarter of 2013 

  

  

the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed longlived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable if future noncash asset impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2014 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

  

income taxes 

  

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 7 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

financial condition and liquidity 

  

3m’s primary shortterm liquidity needs are met through cash on hand us commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances 3m resumed commercial paper funding in july 2013 for the first time since late 2008 3m expects to maintain a consistent presence in the market and believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market 3m’s commercial paper program permits the company to have a maximum of 3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance at both of december 31 2013 and 2012 3m’s outstanding commercial paper balance was zero 

  

the company has sufficient liquidity and generates significant ongoing cash flow which have been used in part to repurchase shares and to pay dividends on 3m common stock in addition 3m’s liquidity and cash flow enable it to meet currently anticipated growth plans including funds for capital expenditures working capital investments and acquisitions as discussed in note 2 in 2012 3m acquired ceradyne inc and other acquisitions for approximately 10 billion in 2011 3m acquired winterthur technologie ag and other acquisitions for approximately 700 million including purchases of noncontrolling interest 3m was able to complete these acquisitions while maintaining a strong net debt position as shown in the table below 

  

   

the company defines net debt as total debt less cash cash equivalents and current and longterm marketable securities 3m considers net debt to be an important measure of liquidity and its ability to meet ongoing obligations this measure is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 

  

at december 31 2013 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the company’s foreign subsidiaries and in the united states totaled approximately 43 billion and 05 billion respectively the united states balance and 62 percent of cash and securities held by the company’s foreign subsidiaries were invested in us denominated cash or cash equivalents or us denominated investments in money market funds assetbacked securities agency securities

3m’s net debt at december 31 2013 was 1219 billion compared to net debt of 308 million at december 31 2012 at december 31 2013 3m had 4790 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and 6009 billion of debt debt included 4326 billion of longterm debt and 1683 billion related to the current portion of longterm debt and other borrowings the current portion of longterm debt includes a eurobond due in july 2014 totaling 1025 billion euros 1424 billion carrying value at december 31 2013 in august 2013 3m repaid 850 million principal amount of mediumterm notes in november 2013 3m issued an eightyear eurobond for an amount of 600 million euros approximately 815 million carrying value at december 31 2013 the designated use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes the strength of 3m’s capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide 3m reliable access to capital markets additionally the company’s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio the company has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service 

  

in september 2012 3m entered into a 15 billion fiveyear multicurrency revolving credit agreement which amended the existing agreement that was entered into in august 2011 this amended agreement extended the expiration date from august 2016 to september 2017 this credit agreement includes a provision under which 3m may request an increase of up to 500 million bringing the total facility up to 2 billion at the lenders’ discretion this facility was undrawn at december 31 2013 in august 2013 3m entered into a 150 million oneyear committed letter of credit facility with hsbc bank usa which replaced the oneyear 150 million committed credit facility that was entered into in august 2012 as of december 31 2013 3m letters of credit issued under this 150 million committed facility totaled 120 million in december 2012 3m entered into a threeyear 66 million british pound approximately 106 million based on agreement date exchange rates committed credit agreement with jp morgan chase bank which is fully drawn as of december 31 2013 apart from the committed facilities an additional 51 million in standalone letters of credit was also issued and outstanding at december 31 2013 the company also utilized 1 million in international committed lines of credit and 10 million in us committed lines of credit with other banking partners as of december 31 2013 these lines of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities under both the 15 billion and 150 million credit agreements the company is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 30 to 1 this is calculated as defined in the agreement as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period at december 31 2013 this ratio was approximately 55 to 1 debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends 

  

the company has a “wellknown seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement effective august 5 2011 which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales this replaced 3m’s previous shelf registration dated february 17 2009 in september 2011 in connection with the august 5 2011 shelf registration statement 3m established a 3 billion mediumterm notes program series f from which 3m issued a fiveyear 10 billion fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 1375 proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including repayment in november 2011 of 800 million principal amount of mediumterm notes in june 2012 3m issued 650 million aggregate principal amount of fiveyear fixed rate mediumterm notes due 2017 with a coupon rate of 1000 and 600 million aggregate principal amount of tenyear fixed rate mediumterm notes due 2022 with a coupon rate of 2000 which were both issued from this 3 billion mediumterm notes program series f the designated use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes 

  

sources for cash availability in the united states such as ongoing cash flow from operations and 3m’s reliable access to capital markets have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases in addition to funding us acquisitions us capital spending us pensionother postemployment benefit contributions and other items as needed for those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely the company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for us operations however if these international funds are needed for operations in the us 3m would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate them refer to note 7 for additional information on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

  

  

in 2014 the company plans to contribute an amount in the range of 100 million to 200 million of cash to its pension and postretirement plans the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2014 therefore the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the us qualified plans’ funded status as of the 2014 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution future contributions will also depend on market conditions interest rates and other factors 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities 

  

3m’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth including continual review of acquisition opportunities 3m paid dividends of 1730 billion in 2013 and has a long history of dividend increases in december 2013 3m’s board of directors declared a dividend of 855 cents per share for the firstquarter of 2014 an increase of 346 percent this is equivalent to an annual dividend of 342 per share and marked the 56th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3m in february 2014 3m’s board of directors also authorized the repurchase of up to 12 billion of 3m’s outstanding common stock which replaced the company’s february 2013 repurchase program this authorization has no preestablished end date as of december 31 2013 approximately 25 billion remained available under the february 2013 repurchase authorization 

  

various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled 5235 billion at december 31 2013 compared with 7430 billion at december 31 2012 a decrease of approximately 22 billion factors which reduced working capital on a combined basis by 24 billion included decreases in cash cash equivalents and current marketable securities along with increases in the current portion of long term debt which is a component of shortterm borrowings and current portion of longterm debt and increases in other current liabilities largely related to the dividend declared in december 2013 that will not be paid until march 2014 discussed in note 5 this was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of approximately 02 billion 

  

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index which includes accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable this combined index defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at yearend — multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable was 48 at both december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 receivables increased 192 million or 47 percent compared with december 31 2012 driven by a yearonyear increase in december sales partially offset by currency translation which decreased accounts receivable by 135 million inventories increased 27 million or 1 percent compared with december 31 2012 with the increases primarily attributable to an increase in demand in the fourthquarter of 2013 partially offset by currency translation which decreased inventories by 75 million accounts payable increased 37 million compared with december 31 2012 primarily related to changes in business activity which were partially offset by a 29 million decrease due to currency translation 

  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents which are presented separately in the cash flows thus the amounts presented in the following operating investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects 

  

  

  

cash flows from operating activities 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows 

  

in 2013 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 517 million compared to 2012 operating cash flows benefited yearonyear from 664 million of lower pension and postretirement plans contributions and increases in net income including noncontrolling interest which were partially offset by higher yearonyear working capital requirements the combination of accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by 407 million in 2013 compared to increases of 312 million in 2012 primarily driven by yearonyear increases in working capital requirements due to increasing sales additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “financial condition and liquidity” section 

  

in 2012 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 16 million compared to 2011 the main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to yearonyear increases in net income including noncontrolling interest 3m was able to achieve this growth in operating cash flow despite contributing an additional 564 million in its pension and postretirement plans when compared to 2011 the combination of accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by 312 million in 2012 compared to increases of 484 million in 2011 

  

free cash flow nongaap measure 

  

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities 3m uses free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash 3m defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap therefore it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures below find a recap of free cash flow for 2013 2012 and 2011

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

as of december 31 2013 the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements refer to the section entitled “warrantiesguarantees” in note 13 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2013 follows 

  

contractual obligations 

  

   

longterm debt payments due in 2014 and 2017 include floating rate notes totaling 156 million classified as current portion of longterm debt and 71 million included in other borrowings in the longterm debt table respectively as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2014 and beyond the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

other obligations included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc 740 which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the longterm portion of the net tax liability of 179 million is excluded from the preceding table refer to note 7 for further details 

  

as discussed in note 10 the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2014 and company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table 

  

  

financial instruments 

  

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

refer to item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk interest rates risk commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the context of item 7a 3m is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities determines certain of the company’s financial risk policies and objectives and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation risk analysis counterparty credit approval and ongoing monitoring and reporting 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps currency swaps commodity price swaps and forward and option contracts however the company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments the company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties 

  

foreign exchange rates risk 

  

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions 3m is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges generally 3m dedesignates these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction the maximum length of time over which 3m hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for a majority of the forecasted transactions is 12 months and accordingly at december 31 2013 the majority of the company’s open foreign exchange forward and option contracts had maturities of one year or less in addition 3m enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing transactions as circumstances warrant the company also uses cross currency swaps forwards and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the company’s net investments in foreign operations the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges and those not designated as hedging instruments were 17 billion and 75 billion respectively at december 31 2013 as of december 31 2013 the company had no cross currency swap and foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges but had designated certain of 3m’s foreign currency denominated debt as nonderivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in note 11 in the “net investment hedges” section 

  

interest rates risk 

  

the company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances 3m manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the dollar equivalent based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates gross notional amount of the company’s interest rate swaps at december 31 2013 was 745 million additional details about 3m’s longterm debt can be found in note 9 including references to information regarding derivatives andor hedging instruments associated with the company’s longterm debt 

  

  

commodity prices risk 

  

certain commodities the company uses in the production of its products are exposed to market price risks 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts the company uses commodity price swaps relative to natural gas as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions to manage price volatility generally the length of time over which 3m hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for its forecasted natural gas transactions is 12 months 3m also enters into commodity price swaps that are not designated in hedge relationships to offset in part the impacts of fluctuations in costs associated with the use of certain precious metals 

  

the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s natural gas commodity price swaps designated as cash flow hedges and precious metal commodity price swaps not designated in hedge relationships were 19 million and 2 million respectively at december 31 2013 

  

value at risk 

  

the value at risk analysis is performed annually a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency rates interest rates and commodity prices and assess the risk of loss or benefit in aftertax earnings of financial instruments primarily debt derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2013 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12month time horizon the exposure to changes in currency rates model used 18 currencies interest rates related to four currencies and commodity prices related to five commodities this model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased in 2013 primarily due to increases in exposures which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model interest rate volatility remained stable in 2013 because interest rates are currently very low and are projected to remain low based on forward rates the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures 

  

   

in addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange rates recent historical information is as follows 3m estimates that yearonyear currency effects including hedging impacts had the following effects on net income attributable to 3m 2013 74 million decrease and 2012 103 million decrease this estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into us dollars the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping venezuelan bolivars into us dollars 3m estimates that yearonyear derivative and other transaction gains and losses had the following effects on net income attributable to 3m 2013 12 million decrease and 2012 49 million increase 

  

an analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each yearend a one percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 76 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 45 million per year

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

a the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15e as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

  

b the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15f management conducted an assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework 1992 based on the assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2013 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 

  

c there was no change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

the company is implementing an enterprise resource planning “erp” system on a worldwide basis which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes the gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years the implementation of a worldwide erp system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness 

  

the company completed implementation with respect to elements of certain processessubprocesses in limited subsidiarieslocations and will continue to rollout the erp system over the next several years as with any new information technology application we implement this application along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process was appropriately considered within the testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances we concluded as part of our evaluation described in the above paragraphs that the implementation of erp in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting

research and patents 

  

research and product development constitutes an important part of 3m’s activities and has been a major driver of 3m’s sales growth research development and related expenses totaled 1634 billion in 2012 1570 billion in 2011 and 1434 billion in 2010 research and development covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses totaled 1079 billion in 2012 1036 billion in 2011 and 919 million in 2010 related expenses primarily include technical support provided by 3m to customers who are using existing 3m products internally developed patent costs which include costs and fees incurred to prepare file secure and maintain patents and amortization of acquired patents

raw materials 

  

in 2012 the company experienced stable to declining cost for most raw material categories and transportation fuel costs this was driven by yearonyear cost decreases in many feedstock categories including petroleum based materials minerals metals and wood pulp based products to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

environmental law compliance 

  

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to the “environmental matters and litigation” section in note 13 commitments and contingencies for more detail 

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2012 3m invested about 27 million in capital projects to protect the environment this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues which are expensed capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s policies stressing environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be about 36 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 

  

while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

  

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

  

· results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic and capital markets conditions the company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately twothirds of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business is subject to global competition and may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as disruptions in financial markets economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions elevated unemployment levels sluggish or uneven recovery in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions natural and other disasters affecting the operations of the company or its customers and suppliers or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates tax rates or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

· the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m the company currently has an aa credit rating with a stable 

  

  

outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting the company’s current ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders failure to maintain the current ratings level would adversely affect the company’s cost of funds and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets 

  

· the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

· foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately twothirds of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

· the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

· the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

· acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

· the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

  

· the company employs information technology systems to support its business including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system on a worldwide basis over the next several years security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations compromise information belonging to the company and its customers and suppliers and expose the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation in the ordinary course of business the company relies on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally the company collects and stores sensitive data including proprietary business information despite security measures and business continuity plans the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events there may be other challenges and risks as the company upgrades and 

  

  

standardizes its erp system on a worldwide basis any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

· the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks including those involving product liability antitrust environmental the us foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery anticorruption or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 13 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements

operating income in 2012 was 217 percent of sales compared to 209 percent of sales in 2011 an improvement of 08 percentage points the primary benefit as discussed in the results of operations section related to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases currency effects reduced diluted earnings per share by an estimated 15 cents net insurance recoveries in 2012 related to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan increased earnings by approximately 4 cents per diluted share in 2011 the impact of natural disasters net of insurance recoveries reduced earnings by approximately 6 cents per diluted share discussed further below early retirementrestructuring costs for 2012 totaled approximately 8 cents per diluted share which included the first quarter 2012 charge of approximately 3 cents per diluted share related to a voluntary early retirement program in the united states

for total year 2011 sales increased 111 percent to 296 billion led by industrial and transportation safety security and protection services and health care all major geographic regions showed improvement led by latin americacanada the increase in global sales reflected improved market penetration and new product flow along with significant growth in important endmarkets such as general industrial and personal safety net income attributable to 3m was 4283 billion or 596 per diluted share in 2011 compared to 4085 billion or 563 per diluted share in 2010 including the firstquarter 2010 special item discussed below 

  

during 2011 3m was impacted by the firstquarter earthquake and tsunami in japan and by the fourthquarter flooding in thailand automobile and electronic manufacturers were most impacted thus 3m’s automotive oem and electronicsrelated businesses were most affected 3m estimates that combined direct and indirect business disruption resulting from the 2011 japan natural disaster net of the benefit from sales of 3m products used in the reconstruction efforts and initial insurance recoveries plus the impact of thailand flooding reduced 2011 sales growth by an estimated 08 percentage points and earnings by approximately 6 cents per diluted share with most of this impact in the first half of 2011 in the fourth quarter of 2011 the flooding in thailand reduced sales growth by an estimated 35 million and operating income by 20 million with this operating income effect offset by 23 million in insurance recoveries related to the earthquake and tsunami in japan japan represented approximately 9 percent of total 3m sales for total year 2011 related to these natural disasters no material asset or investment impairments were recorded in addition 3m did not have any significant issues related to these natural disasters concerning inventories customer receivables lease terminations environmental exposures guarantees indemnifications debt covenant compliance or significant tax issues 3m does have certain 

  

  

insurance coverage which limited its exposure and resulted in some initial recovery in the fourth quarter of 2011 as discussed above 

  

in 2010 3m recorded a onetime noncash income tax charge of 84 million or 12 cents per diluted share resulting from the march 2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act including modifications made in the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 refer to the special items discussion at the end of this overview section for more detail

in 2012 the company experienced stable to declining cost for most raw material categories and transportation fuel costs this was driven by yearonyear cost decreases in many feedstock categories including petroleum based materials 

  

  

minerals metals and wood pulp based products to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

on a worldwide basis 3m’s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at yearend 2012 the us qualified plans which are approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation were 96 percent funded the international pension plans were 81 percent funded and the us nonqualified pension plan is not funded asset returns in 2012 for the us qualified plan were 136 for the us qualified pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2013 is 800 a decrease of 025 percentage points from 2012 the us qualified plan yearend 2012 discount rate was 414 down 001 percentage points from the yearend 2011 discount rate of 415 

  

3m expects to contribute approximately 400 million to 600 million of cash to its global pension and postretirement plans in 2013 the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2013 3m expects pension and postretirement benefit expense in 2013 to decrease by approximately 100 million pretax or approximately 10 cents per diluted share when compared to 2012 refer to “critical accounting estimates” within mda and note 10 pension and postretirement benefit plans for additional information concerning 3m’s pension and postretirement plans 

  

there are a few major items that will impact earnings in 2013 as discussed further above 3m expects that a decrease in pension and postretirement expense will increase 2013 earnings when compared to 2012 by approximately 10 cents per diluted share 3m currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2013 will be approximately 295 to 300 percent compared to 290 percent for 2012 3m expects to incur restructuring and onetime acquisition costs of approximately 30 million in the first quarter of 2013 currency effects are not expected to have a material impact on earnings in 2013 considering these items 3m currently expects that sales growth and related incremental income in addition to other benefits should more than offset the items that will negatively impact earnings 

  

forwardlooking statements in item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected refer to the section entitled “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” in item 1 and the risk factors provided in item 1a for discussion of these risks and uncertainties

operating expenses 

  

   

pension and postretirement expense increased in both 2012 and 2011 the yearonyear increases for 2012 compared to 2011 and 2011 compared to 2010 were 95 million and 233 million respectively the yearonyear increase in 2012 includes a 26 million charge related to the firstquarter 2012 voluntary early retirement incentive program discussed in note 10 these increases negatively impacted cost of sales selling general and administrative expenses sga and research development and related expenses rd 

  

  

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales includes manufacturing engineering and freight costs cost of sales measured as a percent of net sales was 524 percent in 2012 a decrease of 06 percentage points from 2011 the net impact of selling priceraw material cost changes was the primary factor that decreased cost of sales as a percent of sales as selling prices increased 14 percent and raw material costs decreased approximately 2 percent this benefit was partially offset by higher pension and postretirement costs 

  

cost of sales measured as a percent of net sales was 530 percent in 2011 an increase of 11 percentage points from 2010 on a dollar basis selling price increases largely offset raw material inflation for total year 2011 as selling prices increased 1 percent yearonyear and raw material prices increased approximately 4 percent yearonyear however measured as a percent of sales selling priceraw material impacts accounted for approximately 05 percentage points of the cost of sales increase cost of sales as a percent of net sales was also negatively impacted by higher pension and postretirement costs these impacts were partially offset by organic sales volume growth of 37 percent 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased 68 million or 11 percent in 2012 when compared to 2011 in addition to costcontrol and other productivity efforts 3m experienced some savings from its firstquarter 2012 voluntary early retirement incentive program and other restructuring actions these benefits more than offset increases related to acquisitions higher yearonyear pension and postretirement expense and restructuring expenses sga in 2012 included increases from acquired businesses which were not in 3m’s fullyear 2011 base spending primarily related to the 2011 acquisitions of winterthur technologie ag and the doityourself and professional business of gpi group in addition to sga spending related to the 2012 acquisitions of ceradyne inc federal signal technologies group and coderyte inc sga measured as a percent of sales was 204 percent in 2012 a decrease of 04 percentage points when compared to 2011 

  

sga expenses increased 13 percent in 2011 when compared to 2010 due to several factors approximately 5 percentage points of this growth in sga was due to increases from acquired businesses not in 3m’s full year 2010 base spending which primarily related to sga spending for the winterthur technologie ag arizant inc cogent inc and attenti holdings sa acquisitions another 3 percentage points of growth in 2011 sga was due to foreign exchange effects which resulted in higher translated costs from 3m’s nonus subsidiaries finally 2011 sga increased in part due to higher yearonyear pension and postretirement expense and continued investments to support future growth such as sales representatives advertising and promotional investments sga expenses measured as a percent of net sales increased 03 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010 

  

research development and related expenses 

  

research development and related expenses rd increased 41 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased 95 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 as 3m continued to support its key growth initiatives in 2012 these investments along with higher pension and postretirement expense were partially offset by costcontrol efforts and savings from 3m’s firstquarter 2012 voluntary early retirement incentive program in 2011 rd expense increased versus 2010 due to rd related to businesses acquired in the last 12 months foreign exchange effects and higher pension and postretirement expense in addition to 3m’s continued investment in new products rd measured as a percent of sales was 55 percent in 2012 compared to 53 percent in 2011 and 54 percent in 2010 

  

operating income 

  

3m uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools operating income was 217 percent of sales in 2012 compared to 209 percent of sales in 2011 an improvement of 08 percentage points the improvement was driven by a 16 percentage point benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases this was partially offset by increased pensionpostretirement benefit costs and acquisition impacts each of which reduced margins by 03 percentage points and other net impacts which decreased margins by 02 percentage points operating income was 209 percent of sales in 2011 compared to 222 percent of sales in 2010 primarily due to higher cost of sales as a percent of sales in 2011 when compared to 2010 

  

  

interest expense and income 

  

   

interest expense  interest expense decreased in both 2012 and 2011 the 2012 decrease was driven by lower average international debt balances while the 2011 decrease was attributable to lower us debt balances both years were favorably impacted by lower interest rates on us debt 

  

interest income in 2012 lower us cash balances and lower interest rates internationally were offset by higher international cash balances and higher interest rates in the us in 2011 interest income increased slightly as higher international cash balances and better investment yields were largely offset by a lower us cash balance 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

   

the effective tax rate for 2012 was 290 percent compared to 278 percent in 2011 an increase of 12 percentage points various factors increased or decreased the effective tax rate when compared to the same periods last year the primary factors that increased the company’s effective tax rate yearonyear include international taxes specifically with respect to the corporate reorganization of a wholly owned international subsidiary which benefited 2011 state income taxes lower domestic manufacturer’s deduction and the lapse of the us research and development credit these and other factors when compared to 2011 increased the 2012 effective tax rate by 21 percentage points factors that decreased the company’s effective tax rate yearonyear include international taxes as a result of changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes and adjustments to its income tax reserves these factors when compared to last year decreased the effective tax rate 09 percentage points 

  

the effective tax rate for 2011 was 278 percent compared to 277 percent in 2010 an increase of 01 percentage points the yearonyear change in international income taxes increased the effective tax rate for 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 25 percentage points which includes a partial offsetting benefit from the corporate reorganization of a wholly owned international subsidiary in 2011 this 25 percentage point net increase was due primarily to certain 2010 tax benefits which did not repeat in 2011 related to net operating losses partially offset by a valuation allowance resulting from the 2010 corporate alignment transactions that allowed the company to increase its ownership of a foreign subsidiary these transactions are described in the section of note 5 entitled “purchase and sale of subsidiary shares and transfers of ownership interest involving nonwholly owned subsidiaries” other significant items impacting the yearonyear comparison include a onetime 2010 income tax charge of 84 million which benefited the 2011 tax rate when compared to 2010 by 15 percentage points as this charge did not repeat in 2011 the company’s effective tax rate also benefited during 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 07 percentage points from adjustments to its income tax reserves 

  

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law included in this act was the extension of the research and development credit for years 2012 and 2013 as this act was enacted during 2013 the impacts of this law are not included in the 2012 financial results the company anticipates a beneficial impact on the effective tax rate in 2013 for both the 2012 and 2013 research and development credit 

  

the company currently expects that its effective tax rate for total year 2013 will be approximately 295 to 300 percent the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes 

  

refer to note 7 for further discussion of income taxes 

  

  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 

  

   

net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non3m ownership interests in 3m consolidated entities the changes in noncontrolling interest amounts are primarily related to sumitomo 3m limited japan which is 3m’s most significant consolidated entity with non3m ownership interests as of december 31 2012 3m’s effective ownership in sumitomo 3m limited is 75 percent 

  

currency effects 

  

3m estimates that yearonyear currency effects including hedging impacts decreased net income attributable to 3m by approximately 103 million in 2012 and increased net income attributable to 3m by approximately 154 million in 2011 these estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into us dollars the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping venezuelan bolivars into us dollars 3m estimates that yearonyear derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased net income attributable to 3m by approximately 49 million in 2012 and had an immaterial impact on net income attributable to 3m in 2011 

  

performance by business segment 

  

disclosures relating to 3m’s business segments are provided in item 1 business segments financial information and other disclosures are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the reportable segments are industrial and transportation health care consumer and office safety security and protection services display and graphics and electro and communications information related to 3m’s business segments is presented in the tables that follow organic localcurrency sales include both organic volume impacts plus selling price impacts acquisition impacts are measured separately for the first twelve months of the acquisition the acquisition and divestiture impacts if any foreign currency translation impact and total sales change are also provided for each business segment any references to emea relate to europe middle east and africa on a combined basis 

  

in addition to these six operating business segments 3m assigns certain costs to “corporate and unallocated” which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in note 15 corporate and unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items such as corporate investment gains and losses certain derivative gains and losses certain insurancerelated gains and losses certain litigation and environmental expenses corporate restructuring charges and certain under or overabsorbed costs eg pension stockbased compensation that the company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis the primary items driving higher expenses in corporate and unallocated in 2012 when compared to 2011 were pension and postretirement expense as a portion of the 2012 increase in these expenses were not allocated directly to the six operating business segments 63 million and the impact of an increase in other environmental insurance receivables which benefited 2012 by 15 million as discussed in note 13 the impacts of changes in respirator maskasbestos liabilities and receivables netted to a 32 million charge in 2012 which was similar to 2011 resulting in a minimal yearonyear effect the primary item driving higher 2011 expenses when compared to 2010 relates to pension and postretirement expense as a portion of the 2011 increase in these expenses was not allocated directly to the six operating business segments

critical accounting estimates 

  

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

  

legal proceedings 

  

the categories of claims for which the company has a probable and estimable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 13 for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

  

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the us definedbenefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january 1 2009 the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 715 compensation — retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and liability measurement see note 10 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits using this methodology the company determined a discount rate of 414 for us pension and 400 for us postretirement benefits to be appropriate as of december 31 2012 which represents a decrease from the 415 and 404 rates respectively used as of december 31 2011 the weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of december 31 2012 was 378 a decrease from the 458 rate used as of december 31 2011 

  

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the us pension plan the 2013 expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2013 is 800 a 025 decrease from 2012 refer to note 10 for information on how the 2013 rate was determined return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 587 for 2013 compared to 638 for 2012 

  

for the year ended december 31 2012 the company recognized total consolidated pretax pension and postretirement expense after settlements curtailments and special termination benefits of 650 million up from 555 million in 2011 pension and postretirement expense before settlements curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to decrease to approximately 550 million in 2013 a decrease of 100 million compared to 2012 for the pension plans holding all other factors constant a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would decreaseincrease 2013 pension expense by approximately 33 million for us pension plans and approximately 13 million for international pension plans also holding all other factors constant a 025 percentage point increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would decrease 2013 pension expense by approximately 37 million for us pension plans and approximately 19 million for international pension plans in addition a 025 percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would increase 2013 pension expense by approximately 39 million for us pension plans and approximately 21 million for international pension plans 

  

  

asset impairments 

  

as of december 31 2012 net property plant and equipment totaled 84 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled 19 billion management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 74 billion as of december 31 2012 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level 3m has six business segments at december 31 2012 but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units generally correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 

  

an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 

  

as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements effective in the first quarter of 2012 3m made certain product moves across divisions within its business segments but none were across business segments for any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact to reporting units during the first quarter of 2012 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2012 annual impairment test and is in the context of the segment structure that existed at that time 

  

as of september 30 2012 3m had 36 primary reporting units with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 77 percent of the goodwill these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions 3m purification inc occupational health and environmental safety optical systems security systems infection prevention 3m espe industrial adhesives and tapes communication markets health information systems and abrasive systems the fair values for all these significant reporting units were in excess of carrying value by approximately 50 percent or more 

  

in 2012 3m primarily used an industry priceearnings ratio approach but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units to determine fair values where applicable 3m used a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring 

  

based on fourthquarter 2012 testing 3m’s estimated fair value when valuing each reporting unit individually would aggregate to approximately 77 billion implying a control premium of 21 percent when compared to 3m’s market value of approximately 64 billion at both september 30 2012 and december 31 2012 the control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3m’s total company estimated fair value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total company 3m’s market value at both september 30 2012 and december 31 2012 was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately 18 billion 3m is an integrated materials enterprise thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2012 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units 

  

factors which could result in future impairment charges include among others changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document in addition changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results given the current overall economic and other conditions in markets served by certain reporting units and asset groups within these reporting units particularly security 

  

  

systems division 3m will continue to monitor conditions to assess whether long term expectations have been significantly impacted such that future interim impairment tests would be required as of december 31 2012 3m had approximately 600 million of goodwill and approximately 300 million of longlived assets related to security systems longlived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable if future noncash asset impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2013 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

  

income taxes 

  

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 7 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

the company generates significant ongoing operating cash flow which has been used in part to pay dividends on 3m common stock for acquisitions and to fund share repurchase activities as discussed in note 2 in 2012 3m acquired ceradyne inc and other acquisitions for approximately 1 billion in 2011 3m acquired winterthur technologie ag and other acquisitions for approximately 700 million including purchases of noncontrolling interest 3m was able to complete these acquisitions while maintaining a strong net debt position as shown in the table below 

  

   

the company defines net debt as total debt less cash cash equivalents and current and longterm marketable securities 3m considers net debt to be an important measure of liquidity and its ability to meet ongoing obligations this measure is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 

  

  

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31 2012 totaled approximately 57 billion helped by cash flows from operating activities of 53 billion the company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently anticipated growth plans including capital expenditures working capital investments and acquisitions at december 31 2012 and 2011 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held internationally totaled 37 billion and 27 billion respectively and in the united states totaled 20 billion and 19 billion respectively cash available in the united states has historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases in addition to funding us acquisitions us capital spending us pensionother postemployment benefit contributions and other items as needed for those international earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely the company currently has no intention to repatriate these funds if these international funds are needed for operations in the us 3m would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds however for the international funds considered to be reinvested indefinitely 3m’s current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate these funds for us operations refer to note 7 for additional information on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

  

the company’s financial condition and liquidity are strong various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled 7430 billion at december 31 2012 compared with 6799 billion at december 31 2011 an increase of 631 million working capital increases in cash cash equivalents current marketable securities inventories and accounts receivable were partially offset by increases in all major current liability accounts especially shortterm borrowings and current portion of longterm debt 

  

primary shortterm liquidity needs are met through cash on hand us commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances the company maintains a commercial paper program that allows 3m to have a maximum of 3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance as of december 31 2012 and 2011 3m had no outstanding commercial paper the company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted 

  

the company has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service in september 2012 3m entered into a 15 billion fiveyear multicurrency revolving credit agreement which amended the existing agreement that was entered into in august 2011 this amended agreement extended the expiration date from august 2016 to september 2017 this credit agreement includes a provision under which 3m may request an increase of up to 500 million bringing the total facility up to 2 billion at the lenders’ discretion this facility was undrawn at december 31 2012 in august 2012 3m entered into a 150 million oneyear committed letter of credit facility with hsbc bank usa which replaced the oneyear 200 million committed credit facility that was entered into in august 2011 as of december 31 2012 3m letters of credit issued under this 150 million committed facility totaled 121 million in december 2012 3m entered into a threeyear 66 million british pound approximately 106 million committed credit agreement with jp morgan chase bank which is fully drawn as of december 31 2012 apart from the committed facilities an additional 100 million in standalone letters of credit are also issued and outstanding at december 31 2012 the company also utilized 37 million in international lines of credit and 6 million in us lines of credit with other banking partners as of december 31 2012 these letters of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities under both the 15 billion and 150 million credit agreements the company is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 30 to 1 this is calculated as defined in the agreement as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period at december 31 2012 this ratio was approximately 45 to 1 debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends 

  

the company has a “wellknown seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement effective august 5 2011 which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales in september 2011 in connection with this august 5 2011 shelf registration statement 3m established a 3 billion mediumterm notes program series f from which 3m issued 1 billion aggregate principal amount of fiveyear fixed rate mediumterm notes with a coupon rate of 1375 in june 2012 3m issued 650 million aggregate principal amount of fiveyear fixed rate mediumnotes due 2017 with a coupon rate of 1000 and 600 million aggregate principal amount of tenyear fixed rate mediumterm notes due 2022 with a coupon rate of 2000 which were both issued from this 3 billion mediumterm notes program series f the designated use of these proceeds is for general corporate purposes 

  

3m’s cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2012 totaled 2883 billion with an additional 2810 billion in current and longterm marketable securities 3m’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth including continual review of acquisition opportunities 3m paid dividends of 1635 billion in 2012 and has a long history of dividend increases in february 2013 3m’s board of directors increased the quarterly 

  

  

dividend on 3m common stock by 76 percent to 635 cents per share equivalent to an annual dividend of 254 per share in february 2013 3m’s board of directors also authorized the repurchase of up to 75 billion of 3m’s outstanding common stock replacing the company’s existing repurchase program this authorization has no preestablished end date 

  

in 2013 the company plans to contribute an amount in the range of 400 million to 600 million of cash to its us and international pension and postretirement plans the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2013 therefore the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the us qualified plans’ funded status as of the 2013 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution future contributions will also depend on market conditions interest rates and other factors 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities 

  

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index which includes accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable this combined index defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at yearend — multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable was 48 at december 31 2012 a decline from 50 at december 31 2011 receivables increased 194 million or 50 percent compared with december 31 2011 driven by a yearonyear increase in fourth quarter sales acquisitions increased accounts receivable by 84 million and currency translation decreased accounts receivable by 23 million inventories increased 421 million or 123 percent compared with december 31 2011 with the increases partially attributable to an increase in demand in the fourthquarter of 2012 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 acquisitions increased inventories by 125 million while currency translation increased inventories by 46 million accounts payable increased 119 million compared with december 31 2011 acquisitions increased the accounts payable balance by 26 million while currency translation increased accounts payable by 13 million 

  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents which are presented separately in the cash flows thus the amounts presented in the following operating investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects 

  

  

cash flows from operating activities 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows 

  

in 2012 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 16 million compared to 2011 the main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to yearonyear increases in net income including noncontrolling interest 3m was able to achieve this growth in operating cash flow despite contributing an additional 564 million in its pension and postretirement plans when compared to 2011 the combination of accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable increased 312 million in 2012 compared to increases of 484 million in 2011 additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “financial condition and liquidity” section 

  

in 2011 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 110 million compared to 2010 the main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to yearonyear increases in net income including noncontrolling interest two primary items reduced operating cash flows first 3m invested in working capital in support of its growth the combination of accounts receivable inventories and account payable increased 484 million in 2011 compared to increases of 447 million in 2010 with higher fourthquarter 2011 sales compared to fourthquarter 2010 sales contributing to this increase second “othernet” decreased cash flows by 139 million in 2011 compared to an increase of 279 million in 2010 the category “othernet” in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts such as a decrease in accrued payroll amounts in 2011 related to certain annual incentives which reduced liabilities 

  

free cash flow nongaap measure 

  

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities 3m uses free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash 3m defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap therefore it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures below find a recap of free cash flow for 2012 2011 and 2010

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

as of december 31 2012 the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements refer to the section entitled “warrantiesguarantees” in note 13 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 follows 

  

contractual obligations 

  

   

longterm debt payments due in 2013 and 2014 include floating rate notes totaling 132 million classified as current portion of longterm debt and 97 million respectively as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2013 and beyond the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

other obligations included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc 740 which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the longterm portion of the net tax liability of 170 million is excluded from the preceding table refer to note 7 for further details 

  

  

as discussed in note 10 the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2013 and company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table 

  

financial instruments 

  

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

refer to item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk interest rates risk commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the context of item 7a 3m is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities determines certain of the company’s financial risk policies and objectives and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation risk analysis counterparty credit approval and ongoing monitoring and reporting 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps currency swaps commodity price swaps and forward and option contracts however the company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments the company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties 

  

foreign exchange rates risk 

  

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions 3m is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges generally 3m dedesignates these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction the maximum length of time over which 3m hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for a majority of the forecasted transactions is 12 months and accordingly at december 31 2012 the majority of the company’s open foreign exchange forward and option contracts had maturities of one year or less in addition 3m enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements as circumstances warrant the company also uses cross currency swaps forwards and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the company’s net investments in foreign operations the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges and those not designated as hedging instruments were 58 billion and 10 billion respectively at december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the company had no cross currency swap and foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges but had designated certain of 3m’s foreign currency denominated debt as nonderivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in note 11 in the “net investment hedges” section 

  

interest rates risk 

  

the company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances 3m manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the dollar equivalent based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates gross notional amount of the company’s interest rate swaps at december 31 2012 was 342 million additional details about 3m’s longterm debt can be found in note 9 including references to information regarding derivatives andor hedging instruments associated with the company’s longterm debt 

  

commodity prices risk 

  

certain commodities the company uses in the production of its products are exposed to market price risks 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts the company uses commodity price swaps relative to natural gas as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions to manage price volatility generally the length of time over which 3m hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for its forecasted natural gas transactions is 12 months 3m also enters into commodity price swaps that are not designated in hedge relationships to offset in part the impacts of fluctuations in costs associated with the use of certain precious metals 

  

the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s natural gas commodity price swaps designated as cash flow hedges and precious metal commodity price swaps not designated in hedge relationships were 18 million and 1 million respectively at december 31 2012 

  

  

value at risk 

  

the value at risk analysis is performed annually a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency rates interest rates and commodity prices and assess the risk of loss or benefit in aftertax earnings of financial instruments primarily debt derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2012 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12month time horizon the exposure to changes in currency rates model used 18 currencies interest rates related to four currencies and commodity prices related to five commodities this model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit decreased in 2012 primarily due to decreases in exposures which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model interest rate volatility remained stable in 2012 because interest rates are currently very low and are projected to remain low based on forward rates the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures 

  

   

in addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange rates recent historical information is as follows 3m estimates that yearonyear currency effects including hedging impacts had the following effects on net income attributable to 3m fullyear 2012 103 million decrease and fullyear 2011 154 million increase this estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into us dollars the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping venezuelan bolivars into us dollars 3m estimates that yearonyear derivative and other transaction gains and losses had the following effects on net income attributable to 3m fullyear 2012 49 million increase and fullyear 2011 immaterial impact 

  

an analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each yearend a one percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 71 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 42 million per year

research and patents 

  

research and product development constitutes an important part of 3m’s activities and has been a major driver of 3m’s sales growth research development and related expenses totaled 1570 billion in 2011 1434 billion in 2010 and 1293 billion in 2009 research and development covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses totaled 1036 billion in 2011 919 million in 2010 and 838 million in 2009 related expenses primarily include technical support provided by 3m to customers who are using existing 3m products internally developed patent costs which include costs and fees incurred to prepare file secure and maintain patents and amortization of acquired patents

raw materials 

  

in 2011 the company experienced cost increases in most raw materials and transportation fuel costs this was driven by higher basic feedstock costs including petroleum based materials metals minerals and woodpulpbased products to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

environmental law compliance 

  

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to the “environmental matters and litigation” section in note 14 commitments and contingencies for more detail 

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2011 3m invested about 15 million in capital projects to protect the environment this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues which are expensed capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s policies stressing environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be about 31 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 

  

while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

  

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

  

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic and capital markets conditions the company operates in more than 65 countries and derives approximately twothirds of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business is subject to global competition and may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as disruptions in financial markets economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions elevated unemployment levels sluggish or uneven recovery in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions natural and other disasters affecting the operations of the company or its customers and suppliers or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates tax rates or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

 the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m the company currently has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk 

  

  

as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting the company’s current ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders failure to maintain the current ratings level would adversely affect the company’s cost of funds and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets 

  

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately twothirds of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

  

 security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations compromise information belonging to the company and its customers and suppliers and expose the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation in the ordinary course of business the company relies on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally the company collects and stores sensitive data including proprietary business information despite security measures and business continuity plans the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

  

 the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks including those involving product liability antitrust environmental the us foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery anticorruption or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 14 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements

in 2011 the company experienced cost increases in most raw materials and transportation fuel costs this was driven by higher basic feedstock costs including petroleum based materials metals minerals and woodpulpbased products to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

  

on a worldwide basis 3m’s pension and postretirement plans were 82 percent funded at yearend 2011 the us qualified plans which are approximately 71 percent of the worldwide pension obligation were 86 percent funded the international pension plans were 87 percent funded and the us nonqualified pension plan is not funded asset returns in 2011 for the us qualified plan were 87 the yearend 2011 discount rate was 415 down 108 percentage points from the 2010 discount rate of 523 the decrease in discount rates both us and internationally resulted in a significantly higher valuation of the projected benefit obligation which reduced the plans’ funded status the changes in 3m’s definedbenefit pension and postretirement plans’ funded status significantly impacted several balance sheet lines these changes increased longterm liabilities by approximately 24 billion and decreased stockholders’ equity by approximately 16 billion with the other major impact primarily related to increased deferred taxes within other assets other pension and postretirement changes during the year such as contributions and amortization also impacted these balance sheet captions

there are a few major items that will negatively impact earnings in 2012 as discussed further above 3m expects that pension and postretirement expense will decrease 2012 earnings when compared to 2011 by approximately 9 cents per diluted share 3m’s early assessment of the income tax rate indicates an expected 2012 effective tax rate of approximately 295 percent compared to 278 percent for 2011 in addition currency effects are expected to have a negative impact on earnings 3m currently expects that sales growth and related incremental income in addition to expected productivity improvements selling price increases in excess of raw material inflation and other benefits should more than offset the items that will negatively impact earnings

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales includes manufacturing engineering and freight costs cost of sales measured as a percent of net sales was 530 percent in 2011 an increase of 11 percentage points from 2010 levels on a dollar basis selling price increases largely offset raw material inflation for total year 2011 as selling prices increased 1 percent yearonyear and gross raw material prices increased approximately 4 percent yearonyear however measured as a percent of sales selling pricegross raw material impacts accounted for approximately 05 percentage points of the cost of sales increase as discussed in the preceding paragraph cost of sales as a percent of net sales was also negatively impacted by higher pension and postretirement costs these impacts were partially offset by organic sales volume growth of 37 percent 

  

cost of sales measured as a percent of net sales was 519 percent in 2010 a decrease of 05 percentage points from 2009 a number of positive factors impacted yearonyear results these factors included 137 percent growth in organic sales volume improved factory utilization levels along with cost savings related to prior years’ restructuring actions in addition 2009 included a penalty of 05 percentage points as a percent of net sales related to special items as discussed in note 4 restructuring actions in 2009 3m recorded 209 million in restructuring charges of which 110 million was recorded in cost of sales this was partially offset by a 15 million gain on sale of a new jersey roofing granule facility which was also recorded in cost of sales in addition 3m decided to swap venezuelan bolivars into us dollars in 2009 given the economic conditions in venezuela at that time which also negatively impacted cost of sales in 2009 these yearonyear net benefits were partially offset by pricing impacts as selling prices declined 02 percent yearonyear and gross raw material prices increased approximately 2 percent yearonyear 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

selling general and administrative sga expenses increased 13 percent in 2011 when compared to 2010 due to several factors approximately 5 percentage points of this growth in sga was due to increases from businesses acquired in the last twelve months primarily related to sga spending for the winterthur technologie ag arizant inc cogent inc and attenti holdings sa acquisitions another 3 percentage points of growth in 2011 sga was due to foreign exchange effects which resulted in higher translated costs from 3m’s nonus subsidiaries finally 2011 sga increased in part due to higher yearonyear pension and postretirement expense and continued investments to support future growth such as sales representatives advertising and promotional investments sga expenses measured as a percent of net sales increased 03 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010

operating income 

  

3m uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools operating income was 209 percent of sales in 2011 compared to 222 percent of sales in 2010 primarily due to higher cost of 

  

  

sales as a percent of sales in 2011 when compared to 2010 operating income was 208 percent of sales in 2009 2009 was negatively impacted by restructuring expenses net of a gain on sale of real estate which on a combined basis decreased operating income by 09 percentage points 194 million 

  

interest expense and income 

  

   

interest expense  interest expense decreased in both 2011 and 2010 driven by lower average us debt balances and lower interest rates 

  

interest income in 2011 interest income increased slightly as higher international cash balances and better investment yields were largely offset by a lower us cash balance in 2010 interest income also increased slightly with higher average cash and cash equivalent balances largely offset by lower interest rates 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

   

the effective tax rate for 2011 was 278 percent compared to 277 percent in 2010 an increase of 01 percent the yearonyear change in international income taxes increased the effective tax rate for 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 25 percent which includes a partial offsetting benefit from the corporate reorganization of a wholly owned international subsidiary in 2011 this 25 percent net increase was due primarily to certain 2010 tax benefits which did not repeat in 2011 related to net operating losses partially offset by a valuation allowance resulting from the 2010 corporate alignment transactions that allowed the company to increase its ownership of a foreign subsidiary these transactions are described in the section of note 6 entitled “purchase and sale of subsidiary shares and transfers of ownership interests involving nonwholly owned subsidiaries” other significant items impacting the yearonyear comparison include a onetime 2010 income tax charge of 84 million which benefited the 2011 tax rate when compared to 2010 by 15 percent as this charge did not repeat in 2011 this 2010 charge was a result of the march 2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act including modifications made in the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the company’s effective tax rate also benefited during 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 07 percent from adjustments to its income tax reserves 

  

the effective tax rate for 2010 was 277 percent compared to 300 percent in 2009 a decrease of 23 percent this included an approximately 18 percent decrease related to the yearonyear change in international income taxes due primarily to the corporate alignment transactions discussed above additionally the company’s effective tax rate benefited in 2010 compared to 2009 by approximately 13 percent from adjustments to its income tax reserves and by approximately 09 percent from additional domestic manufacturer’s deductions these benefits were partially offset by a 15 percent increase related to the onetime 2010 income tax charge of 84 million 

  

on december 17 2010 the provision for the research and development credit was extended by the “2010 tax relief act” for expenditures incurred up to december 31 2011 the expiration of this research and development credit will have a negative impact on the effective tax rate in 2012 and forward if this credit is not extended in future years 

  

the company currently expects that its effective tax rate for total year 2012 will be approximately 295 percent the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes

performance by geographic area 

  

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area 

  

financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 18 operating income results by geographic area were significantly impacted by restructuring and other items in 2009 restructuring actions partially offset by a gain on sales of real estate decreased worldwide operating income by 194 million with the largest impact in europe asia pacific and the united states

critical accounting estimates 

  

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

legal proceedings 

  

the categories of claims for which the company has a probable and estimable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 14 for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

  

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the us definedbenefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january 1 2009 the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 715 compensation — retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and liability measurement see note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits using this methodology the company determined a discount rate of 415 for us pension and 404 for us postretirement benefits to be appropriate as of december 31 2011 which represents a decrease from the 523 and 509 rates respectively used as of december 31 2010 the weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of december 31 2011 was 458 a decrease from the 504 rate used as of december 31 2010 

  

  

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the us pension plan the 2012 expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2012 is 825 a 025 decrease from 2011 refer to note 11 for information on how the 2012 rate was determined return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 638 for 2012 compared to 658 for 2011 

  

for the year ended december 31 2011 the company recognized total consolidated pretax pension and postretirement expense after settlements curtailments and special termination benefits of 555 million up from 322 million in 2010 pension and postretirement expense before settlements curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to increase to approximately 644 million in 2012 an increase of 89 million compared to 2011 for the pension plans holding all other factors constant a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would decreaseincrease 2012 pension expense by approximately 30 million for us pension plans and approximately 12 million for international pension plans also holding all other factors constant a 025 percentage point increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would decrease 2012 pension expense by approximately 37 million for us pension plans and approximately 16 million for international pension plans in addition a 025 percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would increase 2012 pension expense by approximately 39 million for us pension plans and approximately 19 million for international pension plans 

  

asset impairments 

  

as of december 31 2011 net property plant and equipment totaled 77 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled 19 billion management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group impairments recorded in 2009 related to restructuring actions are discussed in note 4 

  

in june 2009 3m’s security systems division within the safety security and protection services business segment was notified that the uk government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3m’s existing uk passport contracts in october 2010 as a result of this event in june 2009 3m tested the long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity for recoverability and also reassessed their remaining useful lives in addition 3m tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit security systems division level the result of the june 2009 test of recoverability of long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity indicated that the asset grouping’s carrying amount of approximately 54 million before impairment exceeded the remaining expected cash flows accordingly 3m recorded a noncash impairment charge of approximately 13 million in the second quarter of 2009 to write these assets down to their fair value in addition accelerated depreciationamortization was taken over the period june 2009 through the date of expiration of the contract based on a reassessment of the remaining expected useful life of these assets 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 70 billion as of december 31 2011 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level 3m has six business segments at december 31 2011 but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units generally correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 

  

an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 

  

  

as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements effective in the first quarter of 2011 3m made certain product moves between its business segments for those changes that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact to reporting units during the first quarter of 2011 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2011 annual impairment test and is in the context of the segment structure that existed at that time 

  

as of september 30 2011 3m had 38 primary reporting units with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 76 percent of the goodwill these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions 3m purification inc occupational health and environmental safety optical systems infection prevention security systems 3m espe industrial adhesives and tapes communication markets abrasive systems and health information systems 

  

the fair values for 3m purification inc and optical systems based on fourth quarter 2011 testing were both in excess of carrying value by approximately 35 percent while security systems was in excess of carrying value by 38 percent all with no impairment indicated as part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 3m used a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for these divisions using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring the fair values for all other significant reporting units were in excess of carrying value by more than 40 percent 

  

in 2011 3m primarily used an industry priceearnings ratio approach but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units to determine fair values goodwill is testing for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year based on fourthquarter 2011 testing 3m’s estimated fair value when valuing each reporting unit individually would aggregate to approximately 68 billion implying a control premium of 35 percent when compared to 3m’s market value of approximately 50 billion at september 30 2011 at december 31 2011 3m’s market value was approximately 57 billion implying a control premium of 19 percent the control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3m’s total company estimated fair value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total company 3m’s market value at both september 30 2011 and december 31 2011 was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately 17 billion and 16 billion respectively 3m is an integrated materials enterprise thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2011 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units 

  

factors which could result in future impairment charges among others include changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document as of december 31 2011 3m had approximately 1 billion of goodwill related to 3m purification inc 750 million related to optical systems and 500 million related to security systems if future noncash asset impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units in 2012 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

  

income taxes 

  

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 8 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

the company generates significant ongoing cash flow which has been used in part to pay dividends on 3m common stock for acquisitions and to fund share repurchase activities as discussed in note 2 in 2011 3m acquired winterthur technologie ag and other acquisitions for approximately 700 million including purchases of noncontrolling interest in addition in the fourth quarter of 2010 the company purchased arizant inc attenti holdings sa and cogent inc as a result cash outflows including repayment of acquired debt but net of cash and marketable securities acquired for these three acquisitions totaled approximately 14 billion 3m was able to complete these acquisitions without increasing debt balances while maintaining a strong cash cash equivalents and marketable securities position 

  

   

the company defines net debt as total debt less cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 3m considers net debt to be an important measure of liquidity and its ability to meet ongoing obligations this measure is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 

  

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31 2011 totaled approximately 46 billion helped by cash flows from operating activities of 53 billion the company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently anticipated growth plans including capital expenditures working capital investments and acquisitions at december 31 2011 and 2010 cash and current marketable securities internationally totaled 24 billion and 23 billion respectively and in the united states totaled 13 billion and 22 billion respectively cash available in the united states has historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases in addition to funding us acquisitions us capital spending us pensionother postemployment benefit contributions and other items as needed for those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely the company currently has no intention to repatriate these funds if these international funds are needed for operations in the us 3m would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds however for the international funds considered to be reinvested indefinitely 3m’s current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate these funds for us operations refer to note 8 for additional information on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

  

the company’s financial condition and liquidity are strong various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled 6799 billion at december 31 2011 compared with 6126 billion at december 31 2010 an increase of 673 million working capital increases were primarily attributable to a decrease in the current portion of longterm debt 622 million as increases in shortterm marketable securities accounts receivables inventories and other current assets were largely offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents 

  

primary shortterm liquidity needs are met through cash on hand us commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances the company maintains a commercial paper program that allows 3m to have a maximum of 3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance as of december 31 2011 and 2010 3m 

  

  

had no outstanding commercial paper the company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted 

  

in august 2011 3m entered into a 15 billion fiveyear multicurrency revolving credit agreement which replaced the existing agreement that was due to expire in april 2012 this credit agreement includes a provision under which 3m may request an increase of up to 500 million bringing the total facility up to 2 billion at the lenders’ discretion this facility was undrawn at december 31 2011 also in august 2011 3m entered into a 200 million oneyear committed lineletter of credit agreement with hsbc bank usa this agreement replaced the sublimit for letters of credit that was previously encompassed in the 15 billion fiveyear facility as of december 31 2011 available committed credit facilities including the preceding 15 billion fiveyear credit facility and 200 million facility totaled approximately 1785 billion worldwide the amount utilized against these credit facilities totaled 147 million as of december 31 2011 this included 121 million in letters of credit issued under the 200 million facility 18 million in international lines of credit and 8 million in us lines of credit outstanding with other banking partners an additional approximately 100 million in standalone letters of credit was also issued and outstanding at december 31 2011 these linesletters of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities under both the 15 billion and 200 million credit agreements the company is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 30 to 1 this is calculated as defined in the agreement as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period at december 31 2011 this ratio was approximately 40 to 1 debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends 

  

the company has a “wellknown seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement effective august 5 2011 which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales the company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes this replaced 3m’s previous shelf registration dated february 17 2009 in september 2011 in connection with the august 5 2011 “wellknown seasoned issuer” registration statement 3m established a 3 billion mediumterm notes program series f from which 3m issued a fiveyear 1 billion fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 1375 proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including repayment in november 2011 of 800 million principal amount of mediumterm notes 

  

in connection with a prior “wellknown seasoned issuer” shelf registration in june 2007 the company established a 3 billion mediumterm notes program three debt securities have been issued under this mediumterm notes program first in december 2007 3m issued a fiveyear 500 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 465 second in august 2008 3m issued a fiveyear 850 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4375 third in october 2008 the company issued a threeyear 800 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 450 the company entered into interest rate swaps to convert this 800 million note to a floating rate this threeyear fixed rate note and related interest rate swaps matured in the fourth quarter of 2011 

  

3m’s cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2011 totaled 2219 billion with an additional 2357 billion in current and longterm marketable securities 3m’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth including continual review of acquisition opportunities 3m paid dividends of 1555 billion in 2011 and has a long history of dividend increases in february 2012 3m’s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by 73 percent to 59 cents per share equivalent to an annual dividend of 236 per share in february 2011 3m’s board of directors also authorized the repurchase of up to 70 billion of 3m’s outstanding common stock replacing the company’s existing repurchase program this authorization has no preestablished end date 

  

in 2012 the company plans to contribute an amount in the range of 800 million to 1 billion of cash to its us and international pension and postretirement plans with approximately 300 million in each of the first and second quarters the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2012 therefore the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the us qualified plans’ funded status as of the 2012 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution future contributions will also depend on market conditions interest rates and other factors 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities 

  

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index which includes accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable this 

  

  

combined index defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at yearend — multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable was 50 at december 31 2011 a decline from 53 at december 31 2010 receivables increased 252 million or 70 percent compared with december 31 2010 with higher december 2011 sales compared to december 2010 sales contributing to this increase in addition acquisitions increased accounts receivable by 106 million and currency translation decreased accounts receivable by 59 million inventories increased 261 million or 83 percent compared with december 31 2010 the inventory increases are partially attributable to the increase in demand in 2011 in addition acquisitions increased inventories by 128 million yearonyear while currency translation decreased inventories by 18 million accounts payable decreased 19 million compared with december 31 2010 acquisitions increased the accounts payable balance by 68 million while currency translation decreased accounts payable by 5 million 

  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents which are presented separately in the cash flows thus the amounts presented in the following operating investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects 

  

the company revised the amounts previously presented for cash used in investing activities and cash used in financing activities during 2010 by 63 million this revision related to purchases of additional shares noncontrolling interest of nonwholly owned consolidated subsidiaries these immaterial revisions increased cash used in financing activities and decreased cash used in investing activities 

  

cash flows from operating activities 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows in the third quarter of 2009 the company contributed 600 million to its us defined benefit pension plan in shares of the company’s common stock which is considered a noncash financing activity this noncash activity is not reflected in the operating or financing section of the cash flows 

  

in 2011 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 110 million compared to 2010 the main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to yearonyear increases in net income including noncontrolling interest two primary items reduced operating cash flows first 3m invested in working capital which includes accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable in support of its growth working capital increased 484 million in 2011 with higher december 2011 sales compared to december 2010 sales contributing to this increase this compared to working capital increases of 447 million in 2010 second “othernet” decreased cash flows by 139 million in 2011 compared to an increase of 279 million in 2010 the category “othernet” in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts such as a decrease in accrued payroll amounts in 2011 related to certain annual incentives which reduced liabilities 

  

in 2010 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 233 million compared to 2009 the main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to yearonyear increases in net income including noncontrolling interest 

  

  

operating cash flows were reduced by working capital increases of 447 million in 2010 compared to working capital decreases of 617 million in 2009 3m defines working capital as accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable these working capital increases were partially attributable to the rapid increase in demand in 2010 in addition operating cash flows in 2009 benefited from changes in deferred and accrued income taxes 

  

free cash flow nongaap measure 

  

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities 3m uses free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash 3m defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap therefore it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures below find a recap of free cash flow for 2011 2010 and 2009 

  

   

cash flows from investing activities 

  

   

investments in property plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency capital spending increased to 1379 billion in 2011 compared to 1091 billion in 2010 and 903 million in 2009 the company expects 2012 capital spending to be approximately 13 to 15 billion as 3m continues to invest in capacity for future growth in 2011 a large portion of this investment is addressing supply constraints in a number of businesses with significant growth potential such as renewable energy traffic signage in developing economies and optically clear adhesives and glass bubbles in addition some of the following 2010 capital projects carried forward into 2011 in 2010 in the us 3m invested in film manufacturing assets for optical systems and other nonoptical businesses which use similar technology also in 2010 3m increased capacity at its multipurpose manufacturing facility in singapore and invested in optical film capacity in korea lastly in 2010 investments in the industrial and transportation business included solar energy in the us and industrial adhesives and tapes in china in 2009 in response to thendifficult global economic conditions the company reduced its capital spending significantly

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

as of december 31 2011 the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements refer to the section entitled “warrantiesguarantees” in note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 follows 

  

contractual obligations 

  

   

longterm debt payments due in 2012 include 59 million of floating rate notes the floating rate notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments as a result of put provisions longterm debt payments due in 2013 include floating rate notes totaling 73 million and in 2014 include floating rate notes totaling 97 million 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2012 and beyond the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

  

other obligations included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc 740 which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the longterm portion of the net tax liability of 230 million is excluded from the preceding table refer to note 8 for further details 

  

as discussed in note 11 the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2012 and company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table 

  

financial instruments 

  

the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure interest rate risks and commodity price risks a financial risk management committee composed of senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities this committee determines the company’s financial risk policies and objectives and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation risk analysis counterparty credit approval and ongoing monitoring and reporting 

  

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in aftertax earnings of financial instruments derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2011 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12month time horizon the model used analyzed 18 currencies interest rates related to two currencies and five commodities but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased in 2011 primarily due to increases in exposures which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model interest rate volatility decreased in 2011 because interest rates are currently very low and are projected to remain low based on forward rates the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures 

  

   

the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1 percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 71 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 43 million per year derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1 percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 percent of this energy exposure 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the context of item 7a market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document including discussions in item 7 concerning financial condition and liquidity and financial instruments and in the notes to consolidated financial statements longterm debt and shortterm borrowings derivatives fair value measurements and the derivatives and hedging activities accounting policy all derivative activity is governed by written policies and a valueatrisk analysis is provided for these derivatives the company does not have leveraged derivative positions

b the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as defined in the exchange act rule 13a15f management conducted an assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework based on the assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2011 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 

  

c there was no change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

the company is implementing an enterprise resource planning “erp” system on a worldwide basis which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes the gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years the implementation of a worldwide erp system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness 

  

the company completed implementation with respect to elements of certain processessubprocesses in limited subsidiarieslocations and will continue to rollout the erp system over the next several years as with any new information technology application we implement this application along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process was appropriately considered within the testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances we concluded as part of our evaluation described in the above paragraphs that the implementation of erp in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting

research and patents 

  

research and product development constitutes an important part of 3m’s activities and has been a major driver of 3m’s sales growth research development and related expenses totaled 1434 billion in 2010 1293 billion in 2009 and 1404 billion in 2008 research and development covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses totaled 919 million in 2010 838 million in 2009 and 851 million in 2008 related expenses primarily include technical support provided by 3m to customers who are using existing 3m products internally developed patent costs which include costs and fees incurred to prepare file secure and maintain patents and amortization of acquired patents

raw materials 

  

in 2010 the company experienced cost increases in most raw materials and transportation fuel costs this was driven by higher basic feedstock costs particularly oilderived materials and metals to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

environmental law compliance 

  

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to the “environmental matters and litigation” section in note 14 commitments and contingencies for more detail 

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2010 3m invested about 12 million in capital projects to protect the environment this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues which are expensed capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s policies stressing environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be about 30 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 

  

while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

  

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

  

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic and capital markets conditions the company operates in more than 65 countries and derives approximately twothirds of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business is subject to global competition and may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as disruptions in financial markets or downturns in economic activity in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates tax rates or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

 the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m the company currently has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting the company’s current ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders failure to maintain the current ratings level would adversely affect the company’s cost of funds and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets 

  

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately twothirds of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions 

  

  

future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks including those involving product liability antitrust environmental the us foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery anticorruption or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 14 “commitments and contingencies” within the notes to consolidated financial statements

with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service in addition to cash on hand the company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs 

  

in 2010 the company experienced cost increases in most raw materials and transportation fuel costs this was driven by higher basic feedstock costs particularly oilderived materials and metals to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

in 2011 3m expects sales growth of 10 percent or more with organic sales volume growing 55 to 75 percent currency effects adding 1 to 2 percent assuming december 31 2010 exchange rates and acquisitions adding 4 to 6 percent for the year this expected sales growth and related incremental operating income including a benefit from currency effects assuming december 31 2010 exchange rates should more than offset the items that will negatively impact earnings as summarized below 

  

there are a few major items that will negatively impact earnings in 2011 first as discussed further below 3m expects that pension and postretirement expense will decrease 2011 earnings when compared to 2010 by approximately 22 cents per diluted share a banked vacation policy change made in 2009 will also negatively impact earnings in 2011 prior to 2009 3m allowed employees to bank a certain amount of unused vacation effective january 1 2009 3m employees were given two years to use their previously banked vacation with the resulting reduction in 3m’s liability benefiting both 2009 and 2010 operating results this change resulted in an estimated 8 cent per diluted share benefit in 2010 results which will not carryover into 2011 and thus will negatively impact 2011 versus 2010 comparisons finally 3m’s early assessment of the income tax rate indicates an expected 2011 effective tax rate of approximately 295 percent compared to 277 percent for 2010 

  

on a worldwide basis 3m’s pension and postretirement plans were 90 percent funded at yearend 2010 the us qualified plan which is approximately 71 percent of the worldwide pension obligation was 97 percent funded the nonqualified pension plan was not funded and the international pension plans were 89 percent funded asset returns in 2010 for the us qualified plan were 144 while the yearend 2010 discount rate was 523 down 054 percentage points from the 2009 discount rate of 577 3m expects to contribute 400 million to 600 million of cash to its global pension and postretirement plans in 2011 the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2011 3m expects pension and postretirement benefit expense in 2011 to increase by approximately 213 million pretax or 22 cents per diluted share when compared to 2010 refer to critical accounting estimates within mda and note 11 pension and postretirement benefit plans for additional information concerning 3m’s pension and postretirement plans

interest income in 2010 interest income was basically unchanged from 2009 with higher average cash and cash equivalent balances largely offset by lower interest rates interest income declined in 2009 when compared to 2008 primarily due to lower yields on investments 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

   

the effective tax rate for 2010 was 277 percent compared with 300 percent in 2009 and 311 percent in 2008 the most significant item that decreased the effective tax rate in both 2010 and 2009 related to international taxes in 2010 this was due primarily to the 2010 tax benefits resulting from the corporate alignment transactions that allowed the company to increase its ownership of a foreign subsidiary the transactions are described in the section of note 6 entitled “purchase of subsidiary shares and transfers of ownership interest involving nonwholly owned subsidiaries” 

  

the effective tax rate for 2010 also includes a onetime income tax charge of 84 million as a result of the march 2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act including modifications made in the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 adjustments to income tax reserves and the domestic manufacturer’s deduction also benefited yearonyear effective tax rates

the company currently expects that its effective tax rate for total year 2011 will be approximately 295 percent the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes

performance by geographic area 

  

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area 

  

financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 18 operating income results by geographic area were significantly impacted by restructuring and other items in 2009 restructuring actions partially offset by a gain on sales of real estate decreased worldwide operating income by 194 million with the largest impact in europe asia pacific and the united states in 2008 restructuring actions exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate decreased worldwide operating income by 269 million with the largest impact in the united states and europe  

  

a summary of key information and discussion related to 3m’s geographic areas follow 

  

   

for total year 2010 as shown in the preceding table sales rose 153 percent driven largely by organic volume increases of 137 percent every major geographic region expanded sales with total sales in asia pacific up 349 percent latin americacanada up 172 percent the united states up 82 percent and europe middle east and africa up 48 percent investments in innovation and new product development sales and marketing capability and localized manufacturing created new growth opportunities in adjacent market spaces for 2010 international operations represented nearly twothirds of 3m’s sales

employment 

  

at december 31 2010 employment increased by 5222 positions since yearend 2009 largely driven by acquisitions estimated 1850 fulltime equivalents and additions in developing economies at december 31 2009 employment declined by 4348 positions since yearend 2008 largely driven by restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 through the third quarter of 2009 

  

capital spendingnet property plant and equipment 

  

the bulk of 3m capital spending historically has been in the united states resulting in higher net property plant and equipment balances in the united states the company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales and because approximately twothirds of sales are outside the united states this would increase production outside the united states helping to improve customer service lower transportation costs and reduce working capital requirements capital expenditures were 1091 billion in 2010 compared to 903 

  

  

million in 2009 and 1471 billion in 2008 in response to global economic conditions the company reduced its capital spending significantly in 2009 a substantial amount of the 2009 spending was carryover from 2008 or for tooling needed for new products and continued operations the company expects 2011 capital spending to be approximately 13 to 14 billion as 3m continues to fund growth opportunities around the world 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

legal proceedings 

  

the categories of claims for which the company has a probable and estimable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 14 for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

  

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 715 compensation — retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and liability measurement see note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits using this methodology the company determined a discount rate of 523 for us pension and 509 for us postretirement to be appropriate as of december 31 2010 which is a decrease from the 577 and 562 rates respectively used as of december 31 2009 for the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year the weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of december 31 2010 was 504 a decrease from the 530 rate used as of december 31 2009 

  

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the us pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2011 is 850 the same as 2010 refer to note 11 for information on how the 2011 rate was determined return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset 

  

  

allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 658 for 2011 comparable to the weighted average expected return of 690 for 2010 

  

for the year ended december 31 2010 the company recognized total consolidated pretax pension and postretirement expense after settlements curtailments and special termination benefits of 322 million up from 223 million in 2009 pension and postretirement expense before settlements curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to increase to approximately 535 million in 2011 an increase of 213 million compared to 2010 for the pension plans holding all other factors constant a 025 percentage point increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would decreaseincrease 2011 pension expense by approximately 27 million for us pension plans and approximately 11 million for international pension plans also holding all other factors constant a 025 percentage point increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would decrease 2011 pension expense by approximately 30 million for us pension plans and approximately 10 million for international pension plans in addition a 025 percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would increase 2011 pension expense by approximately 31 million for us pension plans and approximately 20 million for international pension plans 

  

asset impairments 

  

as of december 31 2010 net property plant and equipment totaled 73 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled 18 billion management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group impairments recorded in 2009 and 2008 related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in note 4 

  

in june 2009 3m’s security systems division within the safety security and protection services business segment was notified that the uk government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3m’s existing uk passport contracts in october 2010 as a result of this event in june 2009 3m tested the long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity for recoverability and also reassessed their remaining useful lives in addition 3m tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit security systems division level the result of the june 2009 test of recoverability of long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity indicated that the asset grouping’s carrying amount of approximately 54 million before impairment exceeded the remaining expected cash flows accordingly 3m recorded a noncash impairment charge of approximately 13 million in the second quarter of 2009 to write these assets down to their fair value in addition accelerated depreciationamortization was taken over the period june 2009 through the date of expiration of the contract based on a reassessment of the remaining expected useful life of these assets 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 68 billion as of december 31 2010 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year using september 30 net book values impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level 3m has six business segments at december 31 2010 but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units generally correspond to a division 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 

  

an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 

  

as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements effective in the first quarter of 2010 3m made certain product moves between its business segments for those changes that resulted in reporting unit changes the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact to reporting units during the first quarter of 2010 the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by 

  

  

this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2010 annual impairment test and is in the context of the segment structure that existed at that time 

  

as of september 30 2010 3m had 38 primary reporting units with eight reporting units accounting for approximately 71 percent of the goodwill these eight reporting units were comprised of the following divisions 3m purification inc occupational health and environmental safety optical systems 3m espe communication markets industrial adhesives and tapes security systems and health information systems 

  

the fair values for the majority of reporting units were in excess of carrying value by more than 30 percent the fair values for optical systems and 3m purification inc based on fourth quarter 2010 testing were in excess of carrying value by approximately 23 percent and 26 percent respectively with no impairment indicated as part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 3m used a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for optical systems and 3m purification inc using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring in the fourth quarter of 2010 3m made several larger acquisitions these acquisitions with their reporting unit indicated included arizant inc infection prevention cogent inc security systems and attenti holdings sa track and trace with goodwill of approximately 512 million 295 million and 122 million respectively due to the significance of the cogent inc acquisition with respect to its reporting unit 3m will be monitoring the security systems division in 2011 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

  

in 2010 for those reporting units whose fair value was in excess of carrying value by more than 30 percent 3m primarily used an industry priceearnings ratio approach but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units based on the fair values determined using discounted cash flows for certain reporting units and the industry priceearnings ratio approach for the remaining reporting units at september 30 2010 3m’s implied control premium was approximately 23 percent the control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3m’s total company market value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total company at september 30 2010 3m’s market value was approximately 62 billion but if each reporting unit was valued individually 3m’s market value would be approximately 76 billion using a 23 percent control premium 3m is an integrated materials enterprise thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a standalone basis based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2010 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units in addition 3m’s market value at both september 30 2010 and december 31 2010 of approximately 62 billion and 61 billion respectively was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately 16 billion 

  

factors which could result in future impairment charges among others include changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document as of december 31 2010 3m had approximately 1 billion of goodwill related to 3m purification inc and 750 million related to optical systems in addition as a result of the cogent inc acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2010 security systems division goodwill increased to approximately 500 million if future noncash impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units in 2011 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

  

income taxes 

  

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 8 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

the company generates significant ongoing cash flow which has been used in part to fund share repurchase activities pay dividends on 3m common stock and for acquisitions as discussed in note 2 in the fourth quarter of 2010 the company purchased arizant inc attenti holdings sa and cogent inc as a result cash outflows including repayment of acquired debt but net of cash and marketable securities acquired for these three acquisitions totaled approximately 14 billion 3m was able to complete these acquisitions without incurring additional debt while maintaining a strong cash cash equivalents and marketable securities position 

  

   

the company defines net debt as total debt less cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 3m considers net debt to be an important measure of liquidity and its ability to meet ongoing obligations this measure is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 

  

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31 2010 totaled approximately 50 billion helped by cash flows from operating activities of 52 billion the company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently anticipated growth plans including capital expenditures working capital investments and acquisitions the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the company’s stock however the company does have contingently convertible debt that if conditions for conversion are met is convertible into shares of 3m common stock refer to note 10 in this document 

  

the company’s financial condition and liquidity are strong various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled 6126 billion at december 31 2010 compared with 5898 billion at december 31 2009 working capital increases were primarily attributable to increases in cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and inventories which were largely offset by decreases in working capital driven by increases in current liabilities primarily shortterm debt and accounts payable 

  

primary shortterm liquidity needs are met through us commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances the company maintains a commercial paper program that allows 3m to have a maximum of 3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance as of december 31 2010 and 2009 3m had no outstanding commercial paper the company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted effective april 30 2007 the company has a 15billion fiveyear credit facility which has provisions for the company to request an increase of the facility up to 2 billion at the lenders’ discretion and providing for up to 150 million in letters of credit at december 31 2010 available shortterm committed lines of credit including the preceding 15 billion fiveyear credit facility totaled approximately 1674 billion worldwide of which approximately 255 million was utilized in connection with normal business activities debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends 

  

the company has a “wellknown seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement effective february 17 2009 which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales no securities have been issued under 

  

  

this shelf the company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes in connection with a prior “wellknown seasoned issuer” shelf registration in june 2007 the company established a 3 billion mediumterm notes program three debt securities have been issued under this mediumterm notes program first in december 2007 3m issued a fiveyear 500 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 465 second in august 2008 3m issued a fiveyear 850 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4375 third in october 2008 the company issued a threeyear 800 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 450 the company entered into an interest rate swap to convert this 800 million note to a floating rate 

  

the company has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service the company’s 350 million of dealer remarketable securities had ratings triggers bbbbaa3 or lower that would require repayment of debt these securities were retired upon maturity in december 2010 in addition under the 15billion fiveyear credit facility agreement 3m is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 30 to 1 this is calculated as defined in the agreement as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period at december 31 2010 this ratio was approximately 35 to 1 

  

3m’s cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2010 totaled 3377 billion with an additional 1641 billion in current and longterm marketable securities 3m’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth including continual review of acquisition opportunities 3m paid dividends of 15 billion in 2010 and has a long history of dividend increases in february 2011 3m’s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by 48 percent to 55 cents per share equivalent to an annual dividend of 220 per share in february 2011 3m’s board of directors also authorized the repurchase of up to 70 billion of 3m’s outstanding common stock replacing the company’s existing repurchase program this authorization has no preestablished end date 

  

in 2011 the company expects to contribute in cash an amount in the range of 400 million to 600 million to its us and international pension and postretirement plans the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2011 therefore the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the us qualified plans’ funded status as of the 2011 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution future contributions will also depend on market conditions interest rates and other factors 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities 

  

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index which includes accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable this combined index defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at yearend — multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable was 53 at december 31 2010 a decline from 55 at december 31 2009 receivables increased 365 million or 112 percent compared with december 31 2009 with higher december 2010 sales compared to december 2009 sales contributing to this increase in addition acquisitions increased accounts receivable by 93 million and currency translation increased accounts receivable by 82 million as the us dollar weakened in aggregate against a multitude of currencies inventories increased 516 million or 196 percent compared with december 31 2009 the inventory increases are partially attributable to the increase in demand in 2010 in addition acquisitions increased inventories by 77 million yearonyear while currency translation increased inventories by 35 million accounts payable increased 209 million compared with december 31 2009 with acquisitions accounting for 46 million of this increase and currency translation accounting for 16 million with the balance primarily related to improvement in business activity 

  

  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents which are presented separately in the cash flows thus the amounts presented in the following operating investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects 

  

cash flows from operating activities 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows in the third quarter of 2009 the company contributed 600 million to its us defined benefit pension plan in shares of the company’s common stock which is considered a noncash financing activity this noncash activity is not reflected in the operating or financing section of the cash flows 

  

in 2010 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 233 million compared to 2009 the main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to yearonyear increases in net income including noncontrolling interest operating cash flows were penalized by working capital increases of 447 million in 2010 compared to working capital decreases of 617 million in 2009 3m defines working capital as accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable these working capital increases were partially attributable to the rapid increase in demand in 2010 in addition operating cash flows in 2009 benefited from changes in deferred and accrued income taxes 

  

in 2009 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 408 million compared to 2008 the main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to working capital decreases of 617 million in 2009 compared to working capital increases of 154 million in 2008 3m defines working capital as accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable in addition 3m’s deferred and accrued income tax positions benefited 2009 cash flows these positive contributions were partially offset by a decrease of 276 million in net income including noncontrolling interest the category “othernet” in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts this includes the impact of cash outlays for restructuring payments net of restructuring expenses which on a combined basis reduced liabilities note 4 in addition decreases in banked vacation accruals reduced liabilities 

  

  

free cash flow nongaap measure 

  

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities 3m uses free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash 3m defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap therefore it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures below find a recap of free cash flow for 2010 2009 and 2008

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

as of december 31 2010 the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements refer to the section entitled “warrantiesguarantees” in note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 follows 

  

contractual obligations 

  

   

longterm debt payments due in 2011 include 160 million of floating rate notes the floating rate notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments additionally payments due in 2012 include the 226 million carrying amount of convertible notes and payments due in 2013 include 73 million of floating rate notes as a result of put provisions 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2011 and beyond the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

other obligations included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc 740 the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the longterm portion of the net tax liability of 352 million is excluded from the preceding table refer to note 8 for further details 

  

  

as discussed in note 11 the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2011 and company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2011 and future years therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table 

  

financial instruments 

  

the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure interest rate risks and commodity price risks a financial risk management committee composed of senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities this committee determines the company’s financial risk policies and objectives and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation risk analysis counterparty credit approval and ongoing monitoring and reporting 

  

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in aftertax earnings of financial instruments derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2010 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12month time horizon the model used analyzed 18 currencies interest rates related to three currencies and five commodities but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased in 2010 primarily due to increases in exposures which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model interest rate volatility decreased in 2010 because interest rates are currently very low and are projected to remain low based on forward rates the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures 

  

   

the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1 percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 62 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 38 million per year derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1 percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 percent of this energy exposure

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2009 3m expended about 15 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues which are expensed capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s policies stressing environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be about 22 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 

  

while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our disclosure and analysis in our annual report on form 10k contain forwardlooking statements that relate to future events and typically address the company’s expected future business and financial performance based on certain assumptions these assumptions and expectations of future events and trends are subject to risks and uncertainties depending on a variety of factors actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forwardlooking statements provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most significant risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

  

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic and capital markets conditions the company operates in more than 65 countries and derives approximately 63 percent of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as disruptions in financial markets or downturns in economic activity in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates tax rates or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

 the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and have assigned debt ratings to 3m that are near the top of the ratings spectrum this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting the company has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service the company’s strong ratings serve to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders failure to maintain the current ratings level could adversely affect the company’s cost of funds liquidity and access to capital markets 

  

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately 63 percent of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

  

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving product liability antitrust environmental or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 14

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is designed to provide a reader of 3m’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management 3m’s mda is presented in nine sections 

  

   

overview 

  

3m is a diversified global manufacturer technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements effective in the first quarter of 2009 3m made certain business segment realignments including both product moves between business segments and reporting changes related to revised us performance measures the financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented 3m manages its operations in six operating business segments industrial and transportation health care consumer and office safety security and protection services display and graphics and electro and communications 

  

3m’s quarterly yearonyear business results got stronger as 2009 progressed with first ninemonth 2009 yearonyear comparisons significantly negatively impacted by the economic downturn that began impacting 3m in the fourth quarter of 2008 for total year 2009 while sales declined 85 percent and organic volumes declined 95 percent worldwide industrial production is expected to be down by a similar amount and 3m’s sales performance was in line with the overall economy 3m restructured a number of businesses during the year resulting in 2009 total year savings of almost 400 million with estimated additional incremental savings of more than 150 million in 2010 in addition 3m amended its policy regarding banked vacation which added more than 100 million to operating income in 2009 with a slightly lower benefit expected in 2010 3m also enacted temporary furloughs where appropriate froze merit pay and reduced indirect spending finally in the midst of this economic downturn 3m invested 13 billion in research development and related expenses during 2009 

  

3m has been aggressively restructuring the company since early 2008 and continued this effort through the third quarter of 2009 with these restructuring actions and exit activities in the aggregate resulting in a reduction of approximately 6400 positions 3m aggressively reduced structural costs across the company including in the factories the focus now is to accelerate growth in the various businesses and to add only those expenses that are absolutely necessary 3m announced the reduction of approximately 200 positions in the third quarter of 2009 with the majority of those occurring in western europe and to a lesser extent the united states in the second quarter of 2009 3m permanently reduced approximately 900 positions spanning many businesses and geographies and in the united states another 700 people accepted a voluntary retirement option 3m expects that a small portion of those who accepted the voluntary separation will be replaced thus on a net basis 3m estimates an employment level decline of approximately 1400 to 1500 due to these second quarter restructuring actions in the first quarter of 2009 3m announced the elimination of approximately 1200 positions in addition 3m announced reductions of approximately 3500 positions in 2008 with 2400 of these reductions announced in the fourth quarter of 2008 the related net restructuring charges and other special items reduced net income attributable to 3m for year 2009 by 119 million or 017 per diluted share special items reduced net income attributable to 3m for year 2008 by 194 million or 028 per diluted share with 140 million or 020 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008 refer to the special items discussion at the end of this overview section for more detail 

  

fourthquarter 2009 sales totaled 61 billion an increase of 111 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008 with all business segments and major geographic areas showing improvement net income attributable to 3m was 935 million or 130 per diluted share this compares to 536 million or 077 per diluted share which includes the impact of restructuring and other special items in the fourth quarter of 2008 

  

  

sales in 2009 totaled 231 billion a decrease of 85 percent from 2008 including the preceding special items net income attributable to 3m was 3193 billion or 452 per diluted share in 2009 versus 3460 billion or 489 per diluted share in 2008 in 2009 the global economic slowdown dramatically affected yearonyear comparisons for 3m’s businesses substantial endmarket declines and inventory takedowns in major industries including automotive consumer electronics and general industrial manufacturing resulted in significantly lower sales and income accordingly 3m reduced its cost structure lowered manufacturing output and intensified its attention to operational improvement the combination of these actions drove operating income margins of 208 percent in 2009 compared to 206 percent in 2008 restructuring charges and other special items reduced this operating income margin by approximately one percentage point in both 2009 and 2008 

  

in january 2007 3m completed the sale of its branded pharmaceuticals business resulting in a gain in the first quarter of 2007 in addition 3m recorded a gain related to the sale of its opticom priority control systems and canoga traffic detection businesses in the second quarter of 2007 in 2007 these gains on sale of businesses were partially offset by restructuring and the net impact of other special items refer to “special items” at the end of this overview section for additional details including these special items in 2007 3m reported net sales of 24462 billion and net income attributable to 3m of 4096 billion or 560 per diluted share 

  

the following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 refer to the section entitled “performance by business segment” later in mda for discussion by business segment of restructuring and other items that impacted reported operating income refer to note 17 for discussion of corporate and unallocated and elimination of dual credit 

  

   

in 2009 while sales declined 85 percent for the total year this was similar to the overall economy and close to the estimated decline in worldwide industrial production quarterly yearonyear comparisons improved throughout 2009 sales declined 213 percent in the first quarter 151 percent in the second quarter and 56 percent in the third quarter but improved 111 percent in the fourth quarter refer to the sections entitled “performance by business segment” and “performance by geographic area” later in mda for additional discussion of sales change 

  

in 2008 worldwide sales growth was 33 percent localcurrency sales growth was 14 percent for 2008 including a 33 percentage point benefit from acquisitions localcurrency sales increased 171 percent in safety security and protection services including 130 percentage points from acquisitions 67 percent in health care including 17 percentage points from acquisitions 41 percent in industrial and transportation including 37 percentage points from acquisitions and 10 percent in consumer and office including 18 percentage points from acquisitions localcurrency sales declined 16 percent in electro and communications and 179 percent in display and graphics 

  

3m generated 49 billion of operating cash flows in 2009 an increase of 408 million when compared to 2008 this followed an increase of 287 million when comparing 2008 to 2007 in 2009 2008 and 2007 the company utilized approximately 14 billion of cash each year to pay dividends in february 2007 3m’s board of directors authorized a twoyear share repurchase of up to 70 billion for the period from february 12 2007 to february 28 2009 in february 2009 3m’s board of directors extended this share repurchase authorization until the remaining amount is fully utilized as of december 31 2009 approximately 26 billion remained available for repurchase with the company’s emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity and enhancing balance sheet strength share repurchase activity was suspended beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 the extension of this program provides flexibility to resume repurchase activity when business conditions permit in 2009 no broker repurchases of stock were made 

  

  

compared to repurchases of 3m common stock of 16 billion in 2008 primarily in the first nine months of 2008 and repurchases of 3m common stock of 32 billion in 2007 in february 2010 3m’s board of directors authorized a dividend increase of 29 percent for 2010 marking the 52nd consecutive year of dividend increases for 3m 3m’s debt to total capital ratio total capital defined as debt plus equity at december 31 2009 was 30 percent compared to 39 percent at december 31 2008 a portion of the increase in debt at yearend 2008 was the result of a strategy to build and maintain a cash buffer in the us given the difficult market environment at that point in time 3m has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service in addition to cash on hand the company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs 

  

in 2009 the company experienced cost decreases in most raw materials and transportation fuel costs this was driven by lower basic feedstock costs particularly metals and oil derived materials to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

in 2009 3m changed its annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant date to more closely align the award with the timing of the company’s performance review process in 2009 and forward under the annual grant 3m will grant shares in february instead of may as in previous years accounting rules requires recognition of expense under a nonsubstantive vesting period approach requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire 3m employees in the united states are eligible to retire at age 55 and after having completed five years of service approximately 25 percent of the stockbased compensation award expense dollars are for this retireeeligible population therefore in 2007 and 2008 the second quarter of each year because of the may grant date reflected higher stockbased compensation expense than the other quarters in 2009 the retireeeligible impact shifted to the first quarter of 2009 in addition both the first and second quarter of 2009 reflected higher stockbased compensation expense related to the earlier february grant date these and other factors resulted in higher stockbased compensation cost in 2009 when compared to 2008 refer to note 16 for additional discussion of the company’s stockbased compensation programs 

  

3m’s pension plans were 90 percent funded at yearend 2009 the us qualified plan which is approximately 68 percent of the worldwide pension obligation was 96 percent funded and the international plans were 83 percent funded asset returns in 2009 for the us qualified plan were 126 percent while the yearend 2009 discount rate was 577 down 037 percentage points from the 2008 discount rate of 614 3m expects to contribute 500 million to 700 million of cash to its global pension plans in 2010 the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2010 3m expects pension and postretirement benefit expense in 2010 to increase by approximately 130 million pretax or 12 cents per diluted share when compared to 2009 refer to critical accounting estimates within mda and note 11 pension and postretirement benefit plans for additional information concerning 3m’s pension and postretirement plans

fourth quarter and year 2008 results 

  

this business serves a number of endmarkets the most important being consumer electronics and telecommunications along with the global power utility industry in the fourth quarter of 2008 the weak holiday season experienced by the consumer electronics retailers had a large and negative impact on sales in this business likewise the global telecommunications sector continued to cut capital spending on new capacity and on upgrades of existing equipment 3m had a large number of equipment orders cancelled during the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of this endmarket contraction sales in electro and communications declined by 15 percent in the fourth quarter sales in local currency decreased about 12 percent and currency impacts hurt sales by about 3 percentage points operating income declined 38 percent which included 7 million in restructuring expenses 

  

  

for the fullyear 2008 sales in electro and communications increased 1 percent to 28 billion while operating income increased 8 percent to 540 million operating margins were at 19 percent the electrical markets and electronic markets materials businesses drove growth the communications markets and electronics solutions businesses remained soft 3m also continued to experience declines in the flexible circuits business where a number of product solutions were going endoflife operating income in 2008 was impacted by 7 million in restructuring expenses while 2007 included 18 million in restructuring expenses primarily for asset impairment charges related to the company’s decision to close a facility in wisconsin and 23 million for employee reductions and fixed asset impairments related to the consolidation of certain flexible circuit manufacturing operations in aggregate these items contributed 67 percentage points of the reported 79 percent operating income growth when comparing 2008 to the 2007 

  

performance by geographic area 

  

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area 

  

financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 18 operating income results by geographic area were significantly impacted by restructuring and other items in 2009 restructuring actions partially offset by a gain on sales of real estate decreased worldwide operating income by 194 million with the largest impact in europe asia pacific and the united states in 2008 restructuring actions exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate decreased worldwide operating income by 269 million with the largest impact in the united states and europe in 2007 the gain on sale of businesses and a gain on sale of real estate net of restructuring and other items increased worldwide operating income by 681 million with the largest impact in europe 

  

  

a summary of key information and discussion related to 3m’s geographic areas follow 

  

   

for total year 2009 as shown in the preceding table all major geographic areas showed sales declines however yearonyear sales growth improved each quarter throughout the year in the fourth quarter of 2009 sales growth of 111 percent was broadbased every major geographic region expanded sales with strong performances in asia pacific at 22 percent and latin america and canada each at 19 percent with respect to organic volume asia pacific led the way at nearly 19 percent for the fourth quarter korea china and taiwan posted the most significant increases driven by a combination of improved local demand along with the pickup in global electronics organic volumes were flat to slightly down in other geographic regions which is an improvement versus the levels of decline seen in the first three quarters of 2009 for 2009 international operations represented approximately 63 percent of 3m’s sales 

  

   

in 2008 us localcurrency sales increased 27 percent with acquisitions contributing 53 percentage points us organic localcurrency sales growth was led by health care safety security and protection services and industrial and transportation also drove positive sales growth helped by acquisitions this was partially offset by softness in the electronic solutions business and weakness in a few businesses that are impacted by the slowdown in the us housing road construction and mass retail markets and office supply businesses asia pacific localcurrency sales declined 59 percent the significant decrease in optical systems within display and graphics more than offset the sales growth in the other five business segments sales in japan totaled approximately 22 billion with localcurrency sales down 52 percent from 2007 europe localcurrency sales increased 28 percent helped by acquisitions with growth in safety security and protection services health care and industrial and transportation in the combined latin america and canada area localcurrency sales increased 128 percent with growth in all business segments foreign currency translation positively impacted europe sales by 40 percent the combined latin america and canada area sales by 24 percent and the asia pacific area by 32 percent as the us dollar

employment 

  

at december 31 2009 employment declined by 4348 positions since yearend 2008 largely driven by restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 through the third quarter of 2009 at december 31 2008 employment increased by approximately 2900 positions since yearend 2007 with acquisitions during 2008 adding approximately 3700 positions as of december 31 2008 in 2008 3m added employees in brazil india russia china and poland where total sales increased more than 15 percent these increases were offset by reductions in employment in 2008 for a portion of the job eliminations that were announced in connection with restructuring and exit activities 

  

capital spendingnet property plant and equipment 

  

the bulk of 3m capital spending historically has been in the united states resulting in higher net property plant and equipment balances in the united states the company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales and because approximately 63 percent of sales are outside the united states this would increase production outside the united states helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital requirements the dollar amounts in the preceding table support this trend as international capital spending as a percent of worldwide capital spending increased from 41 percent in 2007 to 49 percent in 2009 capital expenditures were 903 million in 2009 compared to 1471 billion in 2008 and 1422 billion in 2007 in response to global economic conditions the company reduced its capital spending significantly in 2009 a substantial amount of the 2009 spending was carryover from 2008 or for tooling needed for new products and continued operations the company expects 2010 capital spending to be approximately 1 billion as 3m continues to fund growth opportunities around the world 

  

  

critical accounting estimates   information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

legal proceedings   the categories of claims for which the company has estimated its probable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 14 for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

  

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc 715 compensation — retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and liability measurement the assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption see note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits using this methodology the company determined a discount rate of 577 for us pension and 562 for us postretirement to be appropriate as of december 31 2009 which is a decrease from the 614 rate used as of december 31 2008 for the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year the weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of december 31 2009 was 530 a decrease from the 553 rate used as of december 31 2008 

  

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the us pension plan the expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2010 is 850 the same as 2009 refer to note 11 for information on how the 2010 rate was determined return on assets assumptions for international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are calculated on a planbyplan basis using plan asset allocations and expected longterm rate of return assumptions the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 689 for 2010 comparable to the weighted average expected return of 686 for 2009 

  

for the year ended december 31 2009 the company recognized total consolidated pretax pension expense after settlements curtailments and special termination benefits of 176 million up from 89 million in 2008 pension expense before settlements curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to increase to approximately 300 million in 2010 for the pension plans holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in 

  

  

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 025 of a percentage point would decreaseincrease 2010 pension expense by approximately 27 million for us pension plans and approximately 10 million for international pension plans also holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of 025 of a percentage point would decreaseincrease 2010 pension expense by approximately 33 million for us pension plans and approximately 17 million for international pension plans see note 11 for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 

  

asset impairments 

  

as of december 31 2009 net property plant and equipment totaled 70 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled 13 billion management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group impairments recorded in 2009 2008 and 2007 related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in note 4 

  

in june 2009 3m’s security systems division within the safety security and protection services business segment was notified that the uk government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3m’s existing uk passport contracts in october 2010 3m remains confident in the future of its overall passport business and the growth prospects remain strong 3m continues to aggressively work to win additional contracts in other countries however as a result of this event in june 2009 3m tested the long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity for recoverability and also reassessed their remaining useful lives in addition 3m tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit security systems division level 

  

the result of the june 2009 test of recoverability of long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity indicated that the asset grouping’s carrying amount of approximately 54 million before impairment exceeded the remaining expected cash flows accordingly 3m recorded a noncash impairment charge of approximately 13 million in the second quarter of 2009 to write these assets down to their fair value in addition accelerated depreciationamortization is being taken over the period june 2009 through the date of expiration of the contract based on a reassessment of the remaining expected useful life of these assets 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 58 billion as of december 31 2009 which based on impairment testing is not impaired impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level 3m has six business segments at december 31 2009 but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics at 3m reporting units generally correspond to a division as of december 31 2009 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 

  

an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 3m completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 

  

as of december 31 2009 3m had 37 primary reporting units with eight reporting units accounting for approximately 75 percent of the goodwill these eight reporting units were comprised of the following divisions 3m purification inc occupational health and environmental safety optical systems 3m espe communication markets industrial adhesives and tapes security systems and health information systems 

  

the fair values for the majority of reporting units were in excess of carrying value by more than 30 percent the fair values for 3m purification inc optical systems and security systems based on fourth quarter 2009 testing were in excess of carrying value by approximately 15 percent to 30 percent with no impairment indicated as part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 3m used a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis for its 3m purification inc optical systems and security systems divisions using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring 

  

  

in 2009 for those reporting units whose fair value was in excess of carrying value by more than 30 percent 3m primarily used an industry priceearnings ratio approach but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units in 2008 3m adjusted the stated applicable industry priceearnings ratio downward for its annual test in the fourth quarter unlike prior years when no adjustment was required without this adjustment the addition of each reporting unit’s estimated market values would have been significantly in excess of 3m’s total company market value which would have resulted in an unusually high implied control premium the control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3m’s total company market value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total company for example at yearend 2008 3m’s market value was approximately 40 billion but if each reporting unit was sold individually 3m’s value would be approximately 52 billion using a 30 percent control premium 3m factored down its priceearnings ratio significantly for the respective reporting units to approximate what the priceearnings ratio would be at a more normal historical control premium of approximately 30 percent for the total company even after including this adjustment to the priceearnings ratio no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units in 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2009 3m’s estimated control premium ranged from 15 to 30 percent with no adjustment required to the priceearnings ratios based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2009 no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units in addition 3m’s market value at december 31 2009 of approximately 59 billion is significantly in excess of its equity of approximately 13 billion 

  

factors which could result in future impairment charges among others include changes in worldwide economic conditions changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this document as of december 31 2009 3m had approximately 1 billion of goodwill related to 3m purification inc 800 million related to optical systems and 200 million of goodwill associated with the security systems division if future noncash impairment charges are taken 3m would expect that only a portion of the longlived assets or goodwill would be impaired 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units in 2010 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 

  

income taxes 

  

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due as of january 1 2007 the company follows guidance provided by asc 740 income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes to record these liabilities refer to note 8 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary 

  

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

financial condition and liquidity 

  

the strength of 3m’s capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide 3m reliable access to capital markets as indicated in the following table at december 31 2009 3m had 46 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and 5710 billion of debt debt included 5097 billion of longterm debt 522 million related to the current portion of longterm debt and other borrowings of 91 million the current portion of longterm debt includes 350 million in dealer remarketable securities which ultimately mature in december 2010 while economic conditions remain uncertain 3m is committed to managing its capital structure very carefully 

  

the company generates significant ongoing cash flow a portion of the increase in debt at yearend 2008 was the result of a strategy to build and maintain a cash buffer in the us given the difficult market environment at that point in time increases in longterm debt have been used to partially fund share repurchase activities and acquisitions on april 1 2008 3m safety security and protection services business completed its acquisition of 100 percent of the outstanding shares of aearo — a global leader in the personal protection industry that manufactures and markets personal protection and energy absorbing products — for approximately 12 billion inclusive of debt assumed which was immediately paid off 

  

   

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31 2009 totaled approximately 46 billion helped by cash flows from operating activities of 49 billion the company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently anticipated growth plans including capital expenditures working capital investments and acquisitions the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the company’s stock however the company does have contingently convertible debt that if conditions for conversion are met is convertible into shares of 3m common stock refer to note 10 in this document 

  

the company’s financial condition and liquidity are strong various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled 5898 billion at december 31 2009 compared with 3759 billion at december 31 2008 working capital increases were attributable to increases in cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and accounts receivable while decreases in shortterm debt accrued income taxes and other current liabilities also increased working capital this was partially offset by working capital increases attributable to increases in accounts payable and accrued payroll combined with decreases in inventory and other current assets 

  

primary shortterm liquidity needs are met through us commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances the company maintains a commercial paper program that allows 3m to have a maximum of 3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance as of december 31 2009 3m had no outstanding commercial paper compared to 575 million in total commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2008 the company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted effective april 30 2007 the company has a 15billion fiveyear credit facility which has provisions for the company to request an increase of the facility up to 2 billion at the lenders’ discretion and providing for up to 150 million in letters of credit at december 31 2009 available shortterm committed lines of credit including the preceding 15 billion fiveyear credit facility totaled approximately 1593 billion of which approximately 145 million was utilized for letters of credit and other shortterm borrowings in connection with normal business activities debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends 

  

the company has a “wellknown seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement effective february 17 2009 which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales no securities have been issued under this shelf the company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes in connection with a prior “wellknown seasoned issuer” shelf registration in june 2007 the company established a 3 billion mediumterm notes program three debt securities have been issued under this mediumterm 

  

  

notes program first in december 2007 3m issued a fiveyear 500 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 465 second in august 2008 3m issued a fiveyear 850 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4375 third in october 2008 the company issued a threeyear 800 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 450 the company entered into an interest rate swap to convert this 800 million note to a floating rate 

  

the company has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service at december 31 2009 350 million of dealer remarketable securities had ratings triggers bbbbaa3 or lower that would require repayment of debt in addition under the 15billion fiveyear credit facility agreement 3m is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 30 to 1 this is calculated as defined in the agreement as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period at december 31 2009 this ratio was approximately 27 to 1 

  

3m’s cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2009 totaled 3040 billion with an additional 1569 billion in current and longterm marketable securities 3m’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth including continual review of acquisition opportunities 3m paid dividends of 1431 billion in 2009 and has a long history of dividend increases in february 2010 the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by 29 percent to 525 cents per share equivalent to an annual dividend of 210 per share in february 2007 3m’s board of directors authorized a twoyear share repurchase of up to 70 billion for the period from february 12 2007 to february 28 2009 in february 2009 3m’s board of directors extended this share repurchase authorization until the remaining amount is fully utilized at december 31 2009 the company has 26 billion remaining under this authorization 

  

in 2010 the company expects to contribute in cash an amount in the range of 500 million to 700 million to its us and international pension plans the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2010 therefore the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the us qualified plans’ funded status as of the 2010 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution future contributions will also depend on market conditions interest rates and other factors 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities 

  

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index which includes accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable this combined index defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at yearend — multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable was 55 at december 31 2009 a significant improvement from 45 at december 31 2008 receivables increased 55 million or 17 percent compared with december 31 2008 currency translation increased accounts receivable by 82 million yearonyear as the us dollar weakened in aggregate against a multitude of currencies inventories decreased 374 million or 124 percent compared with december 31 2008 currency translation increased inventories by 71 million yearonyear accounts payable increased 152 million compared with december 31 2008 currency translation increased accounts payable by 17 million yearonyear 

  

  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions divestitures and exchange rate impacts which are presented separately in the cash flows thus the amounts presented in the following operating investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects 

  

cash flows from operating activities 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows in the third quarter of 2009 the company contributed 600 million to its us defined benefit pension plan in shares of the company’s common stock which is considered a noncash financing activity this noncash activity is not reflected in the operating or financing section of the cash flows 

  

in 2009 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 408 million compared to 2008 the main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to yearonyear working capital improvements of 771 million which includes accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable in addition lower cash tax payments in 2009 benefited cash flows these positive contributions were partially offset by a decrease of 276 million in net income including noncontrolling interest the category “othernet” in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts this includes the impact of cash outlays for restructuring payments net of restructuring expenses which on a combined basis reduced liabilities note 4 in addition decreases in banked vacation accruals reduced liabilities 

  

in 2008 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 287 million net income including noncontrolling interest decreased 631 million primarily due to gains from the sale of businesses in 2007 which did not repeat in 2008 accounts receivable decreases benefited cash flows in 2008 but increases in inventories and decreases in accounts payable negatively impacted cash flows the category “othernet” in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts including outstanding liabilities at december 31 2008 related to 3m’s restructuring actions note 4

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

as of december 31 2009 the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements refer to the section entitled “warrantiesguarantees” in note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 follows 

  

contractual obligations 

  

   

t he company’s 350 million of dealer remarketable securities classified as current portion of longterm debt were remarketed for one year in december 2009 longterm debt payments due in 2010 include these 350 million of dealer remarketable securities which mature in december 2010 and 146 million of floating rate notes the floating rate notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments longterm debt payments due in 2011 include floating rate notes totaling 100 million as a result of put provisions additionally payments due in 2012 include the 225 million carrying amount of convertible notes as a result of put provisions that may or may not be exercised by note holders 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2010 and beyond the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

other obligations included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc 740 the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the longterm portion of the net tax liability of 330 million is excluded from the preceding table refer to note 8 for further details 

  

as discussed in note 11 the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2010 and company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2010 and future years therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table 

  

  

financial instruments 

  

the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure interest rate risks and commodity price risks a financial risk management committee composed of senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities this committee determines the company’s financial risk policies and objectives and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation risk analysis counterparty credit approval and ongoing monitoring and reporting 

  

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in aftertax earnings of financial instruments derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2009 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12month time horizon the model used analyzed 17 currencies interest rates related to two currencies and five commodities but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit decreased in 2009 primarily due to decreases in volatility during 2009 which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures 

  

   

the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1 percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 50 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 37 million per year derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1 percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 percent of this energy exposure

the company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses in general no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the company as a whole or to any of the company’s business segments 

  

raw materials 

  

in 2008 the company experienced cost increases affecting metals wood pulp and oilderived raw materials to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

environmental law compliance 

  

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to “environmental and other liabilities and insurance receivables” in note 14 commitments and contingencies 

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2008 3m expended about 26 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues which are expensed capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s policies stressing environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be about 20 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 

  

while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic and capital markets conditions the company operates in more than 60 countries and derives approximately 64 percent of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as disruptions in financial markets or downturns in economic activity in specific countries or regions or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital interest rates tax rates or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

 the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital   the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and have assigned debt ratings to 3m that are near the top of the ratings spectrum this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting the company has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa1 credit rating with a negative outlook from moody’s investors service the company’s strong ratings serve to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders failure to maintain the current ratings level could adversely affect the company’s cost of funds liquidity and access to capital markets 

  

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately 64 percent of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving product liability antitrust environmental or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable 

  

  

estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 14

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is designed to provide a reader of 3m’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management 3m’s mda is presented in nine sections 

  

   

overview 

  

3m is a diversified global manufacturer technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements effective in the first quarter of 2008 3m made certain product moves between its business segments the financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented 3m manages its operations in six operating business segments industrial and transportation health care safety security and protection services consumer and office display and graphics and electro and communications 

  

3m had record sales in 2008 despite a dramatic fourthquarter 2008 economic downturn 3m is responding to this lower demand with aggressive cost and cash management along with tighter operational discipline 3m expects to manage through these worldwide market challenges and is positioning itself to benefit when growth returns 3m streamlined its operations through 2008 and will continue to optimize to protect against the downside throughout 2009 in the fourth quarter of 2008 alone 3m announced reductions of over 2400 fulltime positions worldwide which brought total year reductions to approximately 3500 these job eliminations spanned all sectors and all geographies but were particularly focused on those developed economies experiencing the most sales pressure in addition 3m has furloughed factory workers until production volumes return to more normal levels and contract workers are also being reduced to only those considered essential these 2008 actions in total are expected to save the company 250 to 300 million in 2009 3m also decided to defer merit pay increases in 2009 except in those cases where local laws prohibit it with estimated costavoidance of approximately 100 million in 2009 in addition 3m has amended its practice on banked vacation — effectively phasing it out — which will reduce expenses by an estimated 100 million in both 2009 and 2010 

  

while this market is difficult to predict in 2009 for planning purposes 3m is assuming yearonyear declines in organic sales volume negative foreign currency impacts on sales operating margin declines and earnings per share declines 3m will work to conserve cash by reducing capital expenditures by more than 30 percent in 2009 and by focusing on reducing working capital 3m has halted stock repurchases until the credit market offers more visibility t he strength of 3m’s customer focused diversified business and technology platforms unparalled geographic reach and relentless attention to operational excellence along with 3m’s balance sheet strength provide a strong foundation for stability and consistency in an uncertain global economy 

  

for the three months ended december 31 2008 sales decreased 112 percent compared to the same period last year due to an increasingly challenging global economy local currency sales which include volume selling price and acquisition impacts but exclude divestiture and translation impacts increased in safety security and protection services and in health care sales in local currencies for the other four business segments dropped during the fourth quarter fourth quarter 2008 net income was 536 million or 077 per diluted share compared to 851 million or 117 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007 in response to difficult economic conditions in the fourthquarter of 2008 3m took actions which resulted in net pretax charges of 219 million for restructuring actions and exit activities which reduced net income by 140 million or 020 per diluted share as 3m aggressively balanced its cost structure to a slower growth environment the fourth quarter of 2007 included net pretax charges of 20 million related to restructuring exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses which reduced net income by 12 million or 002 per diluted share refer to the “special items” summary at the end of this overview section for more detail on these items that impacted results

in december 2006 and january 2007 3m completed the sale of its branded pharmaceuticals business resulting in gains in the fourth quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007 in addition 3m recorded a gain related to the sale of its opticom priority control systems and canoga traffic detection businesses in the second quarter of 2007 in both 2007 and 2006 these gains on sale of businesses were partially offset by restructuring and the net impact of other special items refer to “special items” at the end of this overview section for additional details including these special items in 2007 3m reported net sales of 24462 billion and net income of 4096 billion or 560 per diluted share compared with net sales of 22923 billion and net income of 3851 billion or 506 per diluted share in 2006 excluding the special items in both years the company still achieved strong underlying operating performance helped by a 67 percent increase in net sales which included the divestiture impacts discussed above that reduced sales growth by 38 percent

geographically latin america and canada led localcurrency sales growth in 2008 with a combined increase of 128 percent followed by europe middle east and africa hereafter referred to as europe with a 28 percent increase and the united states with a 27 percent increase localcurrency sales in asia pacific declined 59 percent asia pacific was negatively impacted by optical systems sales which were down 34 percent in that region excluding optical systems asia pacific sales increased nearly 6 percent on a localcurrency basis of the localcurrency sales growth acquisitions contributed 32 percent to the combined latin america and canada 32 percent to europe 53 percent to the united states and 08 percent to asia pacific foreign currency translation positively impacted international sales by 34 percent as the us dollar weakened in aggregate against many currencies in these geographic areas foreign currency translation positively impacted latin america and canada by 24 percent europe by 40 percent and asia pacific by 32 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 foreign currency negatively impacted international sales by 75 percent while difficult to predict given the current exchange rate volatility foreign currency is also expected to have a significant negative impact in 2009 

  

worldwide operating income for 2008 decreased 157 percent yearonyear with most of this impact due to the yearonyear change in special items discussed at the end of this overview in the preceding table health care operating income in 2007 included significant gains related to the sale of portions of its pharmaceuticals business in 2007 negatively impacting the 2008 versus 2007 yearonyear comparisons for this business segment worldwide operating income margins were 206 percent in 2008 including a 11 percent penalty from special items in 2008 operating income for 2007 increased 87 percent yearonyear including a net 22 percentage point benefit from the impact of items discussed in “special items” below operating income margins were approximately 25 percent in both 2007 and 2006 with special items positively impacting these margins in both years by approximately 25 percentage points

in 2007 the electro and communications segment localcurrency sales increased 10 percent driven by 15 percentage points from acquisitions strong sales growth in the communications and electrical markets businesses was offset by declines in the flexible circuits business which supplies components primarily to the ink jet printer market as a number of applications go endoflife softness in this business held back overall electro and communications sales and operating income growth by approximately 25 percent and 10 percent respectively operating income increased 197 percent as this segment has driven productivity improvements and taken actions to improve its competitiveness operating income in 2007 was penalized by a 23 million charge related to consolidating its global flexible circuits manufacturing operations and 18 million in restructuring expenses primarily for asset impairment charges related to the company’s decision to close a facility in wisconsin combined these two items negatively impacted 2007 operating income by 41 million and operating income margins by 15 percentage points in 2006 operating income included 54 million in restructuring 

  

  

expenses primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related benefits including expenses related to the decision to exit certain marginal product lines in the 3m touch systems business 

  

performance by geographic area 

  

financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 18 operating income results by geographic area were significantly impacted by the gain on sale of businesses and other items as discussed at the end of the preceding overview section as discussed in note 18 effective in 2008 the company changed its allocations of rd to more closely align these costs with the geographic areas that benefit with no change in worldwide results the operating income presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented a summary of key information and discussion related to 3m’s geographic areas follow 

  

   

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area 

  

in 2008 us localcurrency sales increased 27 percent with acquisitions contributing 53 percentage points us organic localcurrency sales growth was led by health care safety security and protection services and industrial and transportation also drove positive sales growth helped by acquisitions this was partially offset by softness in the electronic solutions business and weakness in a few businesses that are impacted by the slowdown in the us housing road construction and mass retail markets and office supply businesses asia pacific localcurrency sales declined 59 percent the significant decrease in optical systems within display and graphics more than offset the sales growth in the other five business segments sales in japan totaled approximately 22 billion with localcurrency sales down 52 percent from 2007 europe localcurrency sales increased 28 percent helped by acquisitions with growth in safety security and protection services health care and industrial and transportation in the combined latin america and canada area localcurrency sales increased 128 percent with growth in all business segments foreign currency translation positively impacted europe sales by 40 percent the combined latin america and canada area sales by 24 percent and the asia pacific area by 32 percent as the us dollar weakened in aggregate against currencies in these geographic areas for 2008 international operations represented approximately 64 percent of 3m’s sales 

  

in 2008 restructuring actions exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate decreased worldwide operating income by 269 million with the largest impact in the united states and europe in 2007 the gain on sale of businesses and a gain on sale of real estate net of restructuring and other items increased worldwide operating income by 681 million with the largest impact in europe in 2006 the gain on sale restructuring and other items increased worldwide operating income by 523 million with the largest impact in the united states since 3m sold its global branded pharmaceuticals business in december 2006 and january 2007 both sales growth and operating income were negatively impacted when comparing 2007 to 2006 sales in 2006 for pharmaceuticals totaled 332 million in the united states 315 million in europe 77 million in the asia pacific area and 50 million in the latin america and canada area in addition to 2008 sales and operating income results provided above refer to note 18 for geographic area results for 2007 and 2006

employment 

  

employment increased by approximately 2900 people since yearend 2007 with acquisitions during 2008 adding approximately 3700 people as of december 31 2008 in 2008 and 2007 3m increased employees in the bricp countries brazil india russia china and poland where total sales increased more than 15 percent in both years these increases were offset by reductions in employment in 2008 for a portion of the job eliminations that were announced in connection with restructuring and exit activities employment increased by approximately 900 people when comparing yearend 2007 to yearend 2006 with acquisitions adding approximately 2500 employees while restructuring and the pharmaceuticals divestiture reduced employment 

  

capital spendingnet property plant and equipment 

  

the bulk of 3m capital spending historically has been in the united states resulting in higher net property plant and equipment balances in the united states the company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales and because approximately 64 percent of sales are outside the united states this would increase production outside the united states helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital requirements capital expenditures were 1471 billion in 2008 similar to 2007 capital expenditures are expected to be reduced by more than 30 percent in 2009 

  

critical accounting estimates   

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

legal proceedings   

the categories of claims for which the company has estimated its probable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 14 for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

  

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas no 106 “employer’s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost and sfas no 158 “employer’s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” which was issued in september 2006 and effective as of december 31 2006 sfas no 158 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes 

  

  

in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and liability measurement the assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption see note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits using this methodology the company determined a discount rate of 614 to be appropriate as of december 31 2008 which is an increase from the 600 rate used as of december 31 2007 

  

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 87 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the us pension plan refer to note 11 for information on how the 850 expected longterm rate of return on an annualized basis for 2009 is determined 

  

for the year ended december 31 2008 the company recognized total consolidated pretax pension expense after settlements curtailments and special termination benefits of 89 million down from 190 million in 2007 pension expense before settlements curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to increase to approximately 125 million in 2009 for the pension plans holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 025 of a percentage point would decreaseincrease 2009 pension expense by approximately 26 million for us pension plans and approximately 9 million for international pension plans also holding all other factors constant an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of 025 of a percentage point would decrease 2009 pension expense by approximately 30 million for us pension plans and approximately 12 million for international pension plans a decrease in the discount rate of 025 of a percentage point would increase 2009 pension expense by approximately 31 million for us pension and plans and approximately 14 million for international pension plans see note 11 for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 

  

asset impairments 

  

3m net property plant and equipment totaled 69 billion as of december 31 2008 management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group impairments recorded in 2008 2007 and 2006 related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in note 4 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 58 billion as of december 31 2008 which based on impairment testing is not impaired impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit reporting units are one level below the business segment level 3m has six business segments at december 31 2008 but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics as of december 31 2008 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 

  

an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 3m typically uses the priceearnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for startup loss position and declining businesses but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 3m completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 

  

as of december 31 2008 3m had 34 primary reporting units with eight reporting units accounting for nearly 80 percent of the goodwill at 3m reporting units generally correspond to a division these eight reporting units were comprised of the following divisions occupational health and environmental safety cuno optical systems espe communication markets security systems industrial adhesives and tapes and health information systems these 

  

  

eight reporting units all generated operating income for total year 2008 as part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 3m used discounted cash flow models for its cuno optical systems and security systems divisions a weightedaverage discounted cash flow analysis was performed for the cuno and optical systems divisions using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions among other factors the weighting was based on managements’ estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring the discounted cash flows for the cuno optical systems and security systems divisions were all in excess of their respective net book values with no impairment indicated 

  

in 2008 in addition to using discounted cash flows for certain reporting units 3m used an adjusted industry priceearnings ratio approach for the remaining reporting units 3m adjusted the stated applicable industry priceearnings ratio downward for its annual test in the fourth quarter unlike prior years when no adjustment was required without this adjustment the addition of each reporting unit’s estimated market values would have been significantly in excess of 3m’s total company market value which would have resulted in an unusually high implied control premium the control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3m’s total company market value with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total company for example at yearend 2008 3m’s market value was approximately 40 billion but if each reporting unit was sold individually 3m’s value would be approximately 52 billion using a 30 percent control premium 3m factored down its priceearnings ratio significantly for the respective reporting units to approximate what the priceearnings ratio would be at a more normal historical control premium of approximately 30 percent for the total company even after including this adjustment to the priceearnings ratio no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units in addition 3m’s market value at december 31 2008 of approximately 40 billion is significantly in excess of its book value of approximately 10 billion 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units in 2009 for any triggering events or other signs of impairment 

  

income taxes 

  

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due as of january 1 2007 the company follows fin 48 guidance to record these liabilities refer to note 8 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

financial condition and liquidity 

  

the strength of 3m’s capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide 3m stable access to capital markets in these uncertain times during recent dislocation in the financial markets 3m has had uninterrupted access to the commercial paper market interest rates on commercial paper issued by the company have not been materially negatively impacted by the market difficulties 3m borrowed 850 million via a longterm debt issue in august 2008 with a coupon of 4375 3m also raised 800 million via a threeyear debt issue in october 2008 with a coupon of 45 despite the market turmoil 3m was able to secure funding to alleviate concerns about having ample liquidity to meet its foreseeable needs as indicated in the table below at december 31 2008 3m had 26 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and 67 billion of debt debt is comprised of 1552 billion of shortterm debt including 575 million of commercial paper and 5166 billion of longterm debt approximately 900 million of the longterm debt is classified as current including 350 million in dealer remarketable securities which ultimately mature in december 2010 and a 62 million floating rate note which has a put option at december 31 2008 the majority of the company’s longterm debt balance does not mature until 2011 or later thus while credit markets remain volatile 3m’s capital structure remains very strong 3m is committed to managing its capital structure very carefully 

  

the company generates significant ongoing cash flow increases in longterm debt have been used to partially fund share repurchase activities and acquisitions on april 1 2008 3m safety security and protection services business completed its acquisition of 100 percent of the outstanding shares of aearo — a global leader in the personal protection 

  

  

industry that manufactures and markets personal protection and energy absorbing products — for approximately 12 billion inclusive of debt assumed which was immediately paid off 

  

   

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31 2008 totaled approximately 26 billion helped by cash flows from operating activities of 45 billion at december 31 2007 cash balances were higher due to strong cash flow generation and by the timing of debt issuances the company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently anticipated growth plans including capital expenditures working capital investments and acquisitions the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the company’s stock however the company does have contingently convertible debt that if conditions for conversion are met is convertible into shares of 3m common stock refer to note 10 in this document 

  

the company’s financial condition and liquidity are strong various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled 3759 billion at december 31 2008 compared with 4476 billion at december 31 2007 working capital decreases were attributable to declines in cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and accounts receivable while increases in shortterm debt and other current liabilities also decreased working capital this was partially offset by working capital increases attributable to decreases in accounts payable and accrued income taxes combined with increases in inventory 

  

primary shortterm liquidity needs are met through us commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances as of december 31 2008 outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled 575 million and averaged 1106 billion during 2008 the company believes it unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted in june 2007 the company established a mediumterm notes program through which up to 3 billion of mediumterm notes may be offered with remaining shelf borrowing capacity of 850 million as of december 31 2008 see additional discussion in following paragraph effective april 30 2007 the company has a 15billion fiveyear credit facility which has provisions for the company to request an increase of the facility up to 2 billion at the lenders’ discretion and providing for up to 150 million in letters of credit at december 31 2008 available shortterm committed lines of credit including the preceding 15 billion fiveyear credit facility totaled approximately 1582 billion of which approximately 143 million was utilized for letters of credit in connection with normal business activities debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends 

  

the company has a “wellknown seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement effective february 24 2006 which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales the company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes in connection with this shelf registration in june 2007 the company established a mediumterm notes program through which up to 3 billion of mediumterm notes may be offered in december 2007 3m issued a fiveyear 500 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 465 under this mediumterm notes program in august 2008 3m issued a fiveyear 850 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4375 under this mediumterm notes program in october 2008 the company issued a threeyear 800 million fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 450 under this mediumterm notes program reducing remaining capacity to 850 million as of december 31 2008 the company has the ability to increase the amount of securities that are authorized to be issued under this program 

  

the company has an aa credit rating with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s and an aa1 credit rating with a negative outlook from moody’s investors service at december 31 2008 certain debt agreements 350 million of dealer remarketable securities and 44 million of esop debt had ratings triggers bbbbaa3 or lower that would require repayment of debt in addition under the 15billion fiveyear credit facility agreement 3m is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 30 to 1 this is calculated as defined in the agreement as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period at december 31 2008 this ratio was approximately 30 to 1 

  

  

3m’s cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2008 totaled 1849 billion with an additional 725 million in current and longterm marketable securities 3m’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth including continual review of acquisition opportunities 3m paid dividends of 1398 billion in 2008 and has a long history of dividend increases in february 2009 the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by 2 percent to 51 cents per share equivalent to an annual dividend of 204 per share in february 2007 3m’s board of directors authorized a twoyear share repurchase of up to 70 billion for the period from february 12 2007 to february 28 2009 at december 31 2008 the company has 26 billion remaining under this authorization in february 2009 3m’s board of directors extended this share repurchase authorization until the remaining 26 billion is fully utilized 

  

in 2009 the company expects to contribute an amount in the range of 600 million to 850 million to its us and international pension plans the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2009 therefore the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the us qualified plans’ funding status as of the 2009 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution future contributions will also depend on market conditions interest rates and other factors 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities 

  

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index which includes accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable this combined index defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at yearend — multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable was 45 at december 31 2008 down from 53 at december 31 2007 receivables decreased 167 million or 50 percent compared with december 31 2007 currency translation decreased accounts receivable by 97 million yearonyear as the us dollar strengthened in aggregate against a multitude of currencies inventories increased 161 million or 56 percent compared with december 31 2007 currency translation decreased inventories by 134 million yearonyear accounts payable decreased 204 million compared with december 31 2007 currency translation decreased accounts payable by 35 million yearonyear 

  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions divestitures and exchange rate impacts which are presented separately in the cash flows thus the amounts presented in the following operating investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects 

  

cash flows from operating activities 

  

   

  

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows in 2008 2007 and 2006 the company made discretionary contributions of 200 million to its us qualified pension plan 

  

in 2008 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 258 million net income decreased 636 million primarily due to gains from the sale of businesses in 2007 which did not repeat in 2008 accounts receivable decreases benefited cash flows in 2008 but increases in inventories and decreases in accounts payable negatively impacted cash flows the category “othernet” in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts including outstanding liabilities at december 31 2008 related to 3m’s restructuring actions note 4 

  

in 2007 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 436 million including an increase in net income of 245 million since the gain from sale of businesses is included in and increases net income the pretax gain from the sale of the businesses must be subtracted as shown above to properly reflect operating cash flows the cash proceeds from the sale of the pharmaceuticals business are shown as part of cash from investing activities however when the related taxes are paid they are required to be shown as part of cash provided by operating activities thus operating cash flows for 2007 were penalized due to cash income tax payments of approximately 630 million in 2007 that related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business nonpharmaceutical related cash income tax payments were approximately 475 million lower than 2006 due to normal timing differences in tax payments which benefited cash flows accounts receivable and inventory increases reduced cash flows in 2007 but decreased cash flow less than in 2006 resulting in a yearonyear benefit to cash flows of 323 million the category “othernet” in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts including the impact of cash payments made in connection with 3m’s restructuring actions note 4

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

as of december 31 2008 the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements refer to the section entitled “warrantiesguarantees” in note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 follows 

  

contractual obligations 

   

longterm debt payments due in 2009 include 350 million of dealer remarketable securities final maturity 2010 and 62 million of floating rate notes final maturity 2044 these securities are classified as the current portion of longterm debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments longterm debt payments due in 2010 and 2011 include floating rate notes totaling 85 million and 100 million respectively as a result of put provisions additionally payments due in 2012 include the 224 million carrying amount of convertible notes as a result of the put provision 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2009 and beyond the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

other obligations included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under fin 48 the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the longterm portion of the net tax liability of 314 million is excluded from the preceding table refer to note 8 for further details 

  

  

  

as discussed in note 11 the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2009 and company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2009 and future years therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table 

  

financial instruments 

  

the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure interest rate risks and commodity price risks a financial risk management committee composed of senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities this committee determines the company’s financial risk policies and objectives and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation risk analysis counterparty credit approval and ongoing monitoring and reporting 

  

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in aftertax earnings of financial instruments derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2008 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12month time horizon the model used analyzed 17 currencies interest rates related to three currencies and five commodities but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased substantially in 2008 primarily due to increases in volatility during 2008 which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model the decline in interest rate risk of loss or benefit during 2008 was primarily due to decreases in interest rates the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures 

  

   

the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1 percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 63 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 42 million per year derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1 percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 percent of this energy exposure

business segments the importance of patents in the display and graphics segments is described in “performance by business segment” — “display and graphics business” in part ii item 7 

  

raw materials 

  

in 2007 the company experienced cost increases affecting metals wood pulp and oilderived raw materials costs for these materials have remained high throughout the year and 3m would expect this level to carry over into early 2008 with some moderation occurring later in the year to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

environmental law compliance 

  

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to “environmental and other liabilities and insurance receivables” in note 13 commitments and contingencies 

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2007 3m expended about 21 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s policies stressing environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be about 47 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 

  

while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the most significant risk factors applicable to the company are as follows 

  

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic conditions  the company operates in more than 60 countries and derives approximately 63 of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business may be affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in a specific country or region or adverse changes in interest rates tax or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences  demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company derives approximately 63 of its revenues from outside the united states its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors  the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results  the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated  the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

  

 the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving product liability antitrust environmental or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 13

the following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 refer to the performance by business segment section for discussion of the gain on sale of businesses restructuring and other items that impacted reported operating income results 

  

 

  

  

in 2007 worldwide total sales increased 67 localcurrency sales growth which includes volume selling price and acquisition impacts but excludes divestiture and translation impacts was 73 with organic localcurrency growth of 49 including 07 benefit from pharmaceuticals supply agreements and acquisitions adding 24 divestitures primarily the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business health care segment decreased worldwide sales growth by 38 the sale of the pharmaceuticals business is not presented as a discontinued operation due to the extent of the projected continuing cash flows from 3m’s contractual supply relationship with the buyers in relation to those of the business that was sold 

  

the breadth of 3m’s product lines was evident during 2007 as the company experienced solid sales growth across the portfolio health care led all segments with localcurrency sales growth of 183 excluding divestitures this includes a 44 benefit from acquisitions and 45 benefit due to the pharmaceuticals supply agreements the sale of 3m’s global branded pharmaceuticals business reduced health care sales growth by 237 localcurrency sales increased 108 in safety security and protection services including 74 from numerous acquisitions  localcurrency sales increased 58 in industrial and transportation 50 in consumer and office 23 in electro and communications and 18 excluding the impact of the opticomcanoga divestiture in display and graphics while 3m experienced broadbased sales growth there was softness in certain markets in 2007 within display and graphics o ptical film sales increased slightly yearonyear but 3m experienced an attachment rate loss in lcd desktop monitors and lcd tv segments particularly in the second half of 2007 as competition continued to intensify in this market 3m also experienced weakness in its roofing granules business for residential asphalt shingles and in its electronic solutions business due to softness in certain segments of the consumer electronics market refer to the section entitled performance by business segment for a more detailed discussion of the results of the respective segments 

  

geographically the european region which includes europe middle east and africa led localcurrency sales growth in 2007 with an increase of 117 74 of which was organic excluding acquisitions divestiture and translation impacts sales growth in europe was led by safety security and protection services and health care without pharmaceuticals the combined latin america and canada area localcurrency sales increased 106 of which 96 was organic with growth led by industrial and transportation safety security and protection services and health care without pharmaceuticals asia pacific localcurrency sales increased 49 of which 45 was organic with all six business segments contributing to this increase united states localcurrency sales increased 57 of which 26 was organic organic volume growth in the us was led by health care without pharmaceuticals and industrial and transportation which was partially offset by softness in the electronic solutions business and weakness in a few businesses that are impacted by the slowdown in the us housing road construction and mass retail markets primarily the roofing granules protective materials traffic safety and office supply businesses d ivestitures primarily the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business reduced sales in europe by 66 in the united states by 42 in the combined latin america and canada area by 28 and in asia pacific by 13 currency effects increased total international sales by 52 with europe positively impacted by 85 the combined latin america and canada area by 59 and asia pacific by 20 as the us dollar weakened in aggregate against the multitude of currencies in these geographic areas 

  

operating income for 2007 increased 87 yearonyear including a net 22 percentage point benefit from the impact of items discussed in note a below operating income margins were approximately 25 in both 2007 and 2006 with items in note a positively impacting these margins in both years by approximately 25 percentage points

in 2007 the company experienced cost increases affecting metals wood pulp and oilderived raw materials costs for these materials have remained high throughout the year and 3m would expect this level to carry over into early 2008 with some moderation occurring later in the year to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

  

in 2007 the company modified elements of its longterm incentive compensation programs with the may 2007 management stock ownership program  msop annual grant  the company reduced the number of traditional stock options granted by reducing the number of employees eligible to receive annual grants and by shifting a portion of the annual grant away from traditional stock options primarily to restricted stock units these changes will reduce the annual dilution impact from approximately 15 of total outstanding common stock to approximately 1 however associated with the reduction in the number of eligible employees the company provided a onetime “buyout” grant of restricted stock units to the impacted employees which resulted in increased stockbased compensation expense in 2007 stockbased compensation expense totaled 018 per diluted share in 2007 compared with 017 per diluted share in 2006 the company’s msop including restricted stock units is discussed further in note 15

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area 

  

us localcurrency sales increased 57 with acquisitions contributing 31 percentage points us localcurrency sales growth was led by health care without pharmaceuticals and industrial and transportation which was partially offset by softness in the electronic solutions business and weakness in a few businesses that are impacted by the slowdown in the us housing road construction and mass retail markets primarily roofing granules protective materials traffic safety and office supply businesses asia pacific localcurrency sales increased 49 with all six business segments contributing to this increase sales in japan totaled approximately 2 billion with localcurrency sales up 2 from 2006 european localcurrency sales increased 117 with good growth across all segments especially safety security and protection services and health care without pharmaceuticals in the combined latin america and canada area localcurrency sales increases of 106 were led by industrial and transportation safety security and protection services and health care without pharmaceuticals foreign currency translation positively impacted european area sales by 85 the combined latin america and canada area sales by 59 and the asia pacific area by 2 as the us dollar weakened against these currencies for 2007 international operations represented approximately 63 of 3m’s sales

employment increased by approximately 900 people since yearend 2006 with acquisitions adding approximately 2500 employees while restructuring and the pharmaceuticals divestiture reduced employment employment increased by approximately 4100 people in 2006 compared with 2005 partially due to acquisitions with more than 750 people added by 3m’s three largest 2006 acquisitions alone in addition 3m has increased employees in fastergrowing areas of the world such as brazil india russia china and poland where on a localcurrency basis sales increased more than 15 in both 2007 and 2006 

  

capital spendingnet property plant and equipment 

the bulk of 3m capital spending historically has been in the united states resulting in higher net property plant and equipment balances in the united states the company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales and because approximately 63 of sales are outside the united states this would increase production outside the united states helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital requirements capital expenditures were 1422 billion in 2007 and are expected to total 13 billion to 14 billion in 2008 

  

critical accounting estimates information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations asset impairments and income taxes senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

legal proceedings the categories of claims for which the company has estimated its probable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 13 for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas no 106 “employer’s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost and sfas no 158 “employer’s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” which was issued in september 2006 and effective as of december 31 2006 sfas no 158 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

  

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and liability measurement the assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption see note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on fixedincome investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies using this methodology the company determined a discount rate of 600 to be appropriate as of december 31 2007 which is an increase of 025 of a percentage point from the rate used as of december 31 2006 

  

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 87 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the us pension plan the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 875 for 2007 and will be reduced to 850 for 2008 refer to note 11 for information on how this rate is determined 

  

for the year ended december 31 2007 the company recognized total consolidated pretax pension expense after settlements curtailments and special termination benefits of 190 million down from 347 million in 2006 pension expense before settlements curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to decrease to approximately 90 million in 2008 for the pension plans holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 025 of a percentage point would decreaseincrease 2008 pension expense by approximately 26 million for us pension plans and approximately 11 million for international pension plans also holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of 025 of a percentage point would decreaseincrease 2008 pension expense by approximately 32 million for us pension plans and approximately 21 million for international pension plans see note 11 for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 

  

asset impairments 

3m net property plant and equipment totaled 66 billion as of december 31 2007 management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit impairments recorded in 2007 and 2006 related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in note 4 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 46 billion as of december 31 2007 which based on impairment testing is not impaired impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level reporting units are one level below the business segment level but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics the majority of goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 

  

income taxes 

the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due as of january 1 2007 the company follows fin 48 guidance to record these liabilities refer to note 8 for additional information the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

in 2008 the company expects to contribute an amount in the range of 100 million to 400 million to its us and international pension plans the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2008 therefore the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the usplans funding status as of the 2008 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution future contributions will also depend on market conditions interest rates and other factors 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities

in 2006 cash flows provided by operating activities decreased 365 million this decrease was due in large part to an increase of approximately 600 million in tax payments in 2006 compared with 2005 the higher tax payments in 2006 primarily related to the company’s repatriation of 17 billion of foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the category “othernet” in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts including outstanding liabilities at december 31 2006 related to 3m’s restructuring actions note 4

as of december 31 2007 the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements 3m’s accrued product warranty liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of current and longterm liabilities are estimated at approximately 21 million 3m does not consider this amount to be material  the fair value of 3m guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 follows 

  

contractual obligations 

   

longterm debt payments due in 2008 include 350 million of dealer remarketable securities final maturity 2010 and 62 million of floating rate notes final maturity 2044 these securities are classified as the current portion of longterm debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2008 and beyond the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

other obligations included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under fin 48 the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the longterm portion of the liability of 304 million is excluded from the preceding table refer to note 8 for further details 

  

as discussed in note 11 the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2008 and company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2008 and future years therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in aftertax earnings of financial instruments derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2007 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 confidence level over a 12month time horizon the model used analyzed 17 currencies interest rates related to three currencies and five commodities but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures 

  

  

 

  

the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1 price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 60 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a 10 price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 38 million per year derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1 of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 of this energy exposure

research and patents 

research and product development constitutes an important part of 3m’s activities and has been a major driver of 3m’s sales growth research development and related expenses totaled 1522 billion in 2006 this amount included a 95 million inprocess research and development charge discussed in note 2 and 75 million in restructuring actions note 4 research development and related expenses totaled 1274 billion in 2005 and 1246 billion in 2004 research and development covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses totaled 943 million in 2006 including the 95 million for purchased inprocess research and development discussed above research and development expenses totaled 818 million in 2005 and 792 million in 2004 related expenses primarily include technical support provided by 3m to existing customers who are using 3m products and the costs of internally developed patents 

the company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks that are important to the company the company also owns or holds licenses to use numerous us and foreign patents the company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country

raw materials 

in 2006 the company experienced price increases affecting metals wood pulp and oilderived raw materials during the fourth quarter of 2006 total market demand for metals and oilderived raw materials began to soften and the company is therefore pursuing price reductions for those commodities to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and 

qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

environmental law compliance 

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to “environmental and other liabilities and insurance receivables” in note 13 commitments and contingencies 

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

in 2006 3m expended about 18 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment the comparable amount in 2005 was about 28 million these amounts exclude expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s policies stressing environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be about 20 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 

while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

the most significant risk factors applicable to the company are as follows 

 results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic conditions  the company operates in more than 60 countries and derives more than 60 of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business may be affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in a specific country or region or adverse changes in interest rates tax or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates

 the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences  demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company derives more than 60 of its revenues from outside the united states its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies

 the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful

 the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors  the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products and it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can

be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

 acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results  the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies

 the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates less productivity improvements than estimated  the company utilizes various tools such as lean six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 

 the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving product liability antitrust environmental or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 13

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

3m is a diversified global manufacturer technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products 3m manages its operations in six operating business segments industrial and transportation health care display and graphics consumer and office safety security and protection services and electro and communications 

3m’s strategy emphasizes a commitment to grow at a faster pace using a fourpronged approach which includes reinvesting in its core businesses developing adjacent emerging business opportunities expanding on the company’s already worldclass capabilities outside the united states and acquiring companies in fastergrowing industries 

·   3m’s reinvestment in the core is evidenced through its 2006 investments in new production capacity in a number of growing and highly profitable businesses such as medical respiratory protection lcd films and others in addition 3m is investing in research and development which should position our existing business portfolio for accelerated growth

·   3m launched five new emerging business opportunities including our track and trace initiative global mining food safety filtration and energy 3m made great progress on its track and trace initiative in 2006 merging a number of formerly disparate efforts into one single growth engine for the future track and trace has a growing array of applications — from tracking packages to managing medical and legal records

·   3m continued to build its capabilities in many of the world’s fastestgrowing emerging economies in 2006 3m began construction of three new plants in china one in russia one in poland and one in india by the end of 2007 3m expects to have 10 or more plants open or under construction in china 3m also drove outstanding growth in more developed countries european sales growth was about 10 in us dollars and 83 in local currencies

·   3m closed on 19 acquisitions in 2006 all contributing to growth in different ways acquisitions were made to add products and gapfillers to expand our offerings and become more important to our customers to add capacity to get access to local markets via local brands and to augment our existing technology base

with a continued focus on these strategies into 2007 3m believes it can transform itself into a fastergrowing company 

the company expects to increase both research and development excluding the pharmaceuticals business acquired inprocess research and development charge and restructuringrelated items and capital expenditures in 2007 with investments in growth programs around the world research development and related expenses totaled 1522 billion in 2006 this included a 95 million inprocess research and development charge discussed in note 2 and approximately 75 million in restructuringrelated items discussed in note 4 adjusted for these items research development and related expenses still increased by over 6 total capital expenditures for 2006 totaled 1168 billion up 225 million compared with 2005 the company expects capital expenditures to total approximately 14 billion to 15 billion in 2007 providing the capacity to meet expected growth 

3m announced in april 2006 that it would explore strategic alternatives for its global branded pharmaceuticals business 3m believes that in today’s very competitive pharmaceuticals marketplace continued success in brand pharmaceuticals requires broad pipelines of new drugs significant investments and a longerterm riskreward model than applies to most other 3m businesses in december 2006 and january 2007 3m completed the sale of its branded pharmaceuticals business as discussed in note 2 the january 2007 transaction will be recorded in the first quarter of 2007 as previously disclosed 3m had indicated that it would likely incur some restructuringrelated costs associated with selling the business 

as a result of the above in the fourth quarter of 2006 3m recorded a gain on sale which was partially offset by restructuring and other items including these items i n 2006 3m reported record net sales of 22923 billion and record net income of 3851 billion or 506 per diluted share compared with net sales of 21167 billion and net income of 3111 billion or 398 per diluted share excluding these items the company still achieved strong underlying operating performance helped by the combination of an 83 increase in net sales including core localcurrency sales growth of 56 which excludes the impact of businesses acquired in the last 12 months 

in 2006 the gain on sale net of restructuring and other items increased operating income by 523 million and net income by 438 million or 057 per diluted share 2006 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of certain portions of 3m’s branded pharmaceuticals business 1074 billion pretax 674 million aftertax and favorable income tax adjustments 149 million which were partially offset by restructuring actions 403 million pretax 257 million aftertax acquired inprocess research and development expenses 95 million pretax and aftertax settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action 40 million pretax 25 million aftertax and environmental obligations related to the pharmaceuticals business 13 million pretax 8 million aftertax these items are discussed in more detail in note 2 acquisitions and divestitures note 4 2006 restructuring actions note 8 income taxes and note 13 commitments and contingencies 

in 2005 3m adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation fasb no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” and repatriated approximately 17 billion of foreign earnings to the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 refer to note 1 and note 8 for more detail combined these two items reduced net income by 110 million in 2005 

the following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 refer to the performance by business segment section for discussion of the net impact of the gain on sale restructuring and other items that increased health care operating income but which reduced most of the other business segments’ operating income 

  

   

3m’s sales performance in 2006 was broadbased with all six business segments contributing to positive localcurrency sales growth sales growth in the industrial and transportation segment was led by industrial adhesives and tapes along with the automotive aftermarket business acquisitions primarily cuno added 46 to industrial and transportation sales growth sales growth in health care was led by 3m’s core medical and dental businesses display and graphics sales growth was led by display enhancement films used in flatpanel devices and strong growth in the commercial graphics business sales growth in the consumer and office segment was broadbased across the many channels 3m serves most notably in the massmarket consumer and home improvement retail channels sales growth in the safety security and protection services segment was driven by continued strong demand for personal protection products and solutions particularly respiratory protection products acquisitions primarily security printing and systems limited which was acquired in august 2006 added 40 to safety security and protection services sales growth for the electro and communications segment sales growth was led by demand for 3m electronic products for semiconductor manufacturers along with continued strong growth in electrical products for insulating testing and sensing refer to the performance by business segment section for a more detailed discussion of the results of the respective segments 

geographically us sales revenue increased 71 asia pacific localcurrency sales which exclude translation impacts increased 92 european localcurrency sales increased 83 and the combined latin america and canada area localcurrency sales increased 61 refer to the performance by geographic area section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective areas 

operating income improvement for the year excluding the gain on the branded pharmaceuticals sale and restructuring and other items was led by the industrial and transportation segment and the safety security and protection services segment display and graphics was hurt by sales price declines a sales mix shift towards larger lcd displays and operational challenges related to the company’s new optical film manufacturing production line which have since been resolved the display and graphics segment and electro and communications segment were impacted the most by businessspecific restructuring actions note 4 and business segment discussion 3m’s operating income margins remained at healthy levels even after adjusting for net gains related to the branded pharmaceuticals sale restructuring and other items 

for the year 2006  the company utilized 37 billion of cash to repurchase 3m common stock and pay dividends in august 2006 3m’s board of directors authorized an additional 1 billion in share repurchases of the company’s stock raising the total authorization to 3 billion between february 13 2006 and february 28 2007 as of december 31 2006 748 million remained available for repurchases in february 2007 3m’s board authorized a dividend increase of 43 to 48 cents per share equivalent to an annual dividend of 192 per share for 2007 marking the 49 th consecutive year of dividend increases and also approved a 7 billion twoyear share repurchase authorization for the period from february 12 2007 to february 28 2009 3m’s debt to total capital ratio total capital defined as debt plus equity as of december 31 2006 was 26 3m has an aa credit rating from standard  poor’s and an aa1 credit rating from moody’s investors service

in 2006 the company experienced price increases affecting metals wood pulp and oilderived raw materials during the fourth quarter of 2006 total market demand for metals and oilderived raw materials began to soften and the company is therefore pursuing price reductions for those commodities t he company to date is receiving sufficient 

quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements but it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact results although the company minimizes this effect through hedging about half of this impact 3m continued as it has for many years to incur expenses insured and uninsured in managing its litigation and environmental contingencies

the sale of the pharmaceuticals business is not presented as a discontinued operation due to the extent of the projected continuing cash flows from our contractual supply relationship with the buyers in relation to those of the business that was sold therefore it will create both a sales and profitability comparability issue beginning with first quarter 2007 results annual sales in 2006 for pharmaceuticals were 774 million and reported operating income was 1039 billion including net gains of 783 million as discussed in the “pharmaceuticals business” discussion that follows sales growth in 2007 will be negatively impacted as these pharmaceutical sales are in the base 2006 period 3m’s drug delivery systems division will be a source of supply to the acquiring companies with expected annual revenues of approximately 100 million from the various arrangements with the three buyers such outsourcing arrangements involve a lower profitability than the other product and service offerings of most of our existing health care businesses

3m restructured many areas in parallel with divesting the global branded pharmaceuticals business the great majority of those costs will not be eliminated until late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2007 earnings growth is expected to be slowest in the first quarter of 2007 due to these continued expenses and the strong comparable first quarter in 2006 3m expects earnings to improve somewhat in the second quarter of 2007 and accelerate more into the second half of the year 

beginning in 2007 the company is modifying its longterm and shortterm incentive compensation programs to align employee and shareholder interests more closely the company’s shortterm incentive compensation plan is moving away from its quarterly yearoveryear focused profit sharing plan toward an annual bonus plan with payouts tied principally to performance measured by the operating plan the company is also reducing the number of traditional stock options granted under its longterm incentive compensation plan by reducing the number of employees eligible to receive annual grants and by shifting a portion of the annual grant away from traditional stock options primarily to restricted stock units these changes will reduce the annual dilution impact from 15 of total outstanding common stock to about 1 however associated with the reduction in the number of eligible employees the company decided to provide a onetime “buyout” grant to the impacted employees which will result in increased stockbased compensation expense in 2007 in addition 3m’s change in the vesting period for stock options from one to three years starting with the may 2005 grant also results in higher expense in 2007 compared with 2006 stockbased compensation expense is expected to total 021 per diluted share in 2007 compared with 017 per diluted share in 2006 

the preceding forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected refer to the forwardlooking statements section in item 7 and the risk factors provided in item 1a for discussion of these risks and uncertainties 

as discussed in note 1 effective january 1 2006 3m adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r which required 3m to expense stockbased compensation the company adopted sfas no 123r using the modified retrospective method effective january 1 2006 all prior periods were revised to give effect to the fairvaluebased method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after january 1 1995 stockbased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 is summarized by business segment in the table that follows 

 

  

the 45 million increase in stock option expense in 2006 compared with 2005 is primarily due to two reasons first effective january 1 2006 accounting rules required the acceleration of stockbased compensation expense recognition to when an employee is eligible to retire instead of over the entire vesting period for these retirementeligible employees resulting in recognition of approximately 25 percent of the expense in the month of grant second quarter for 3m’s annual stock option grant second 3m changed its vesting period from one to three years starting with the may 2005 grant the third and fourth quarters of 2006 include expense from both the 2005 and 2006 stock option grants while the third and fourth quarters of 2005 only include expense from the 2005 stock option grant the decrease in the 2005 expense compared with 2004 is primarily due to the change in 3m’s option vesting period 

index to management’s discussion and analysis 

of financial condition and results of operations 

   

results of operations 

net sales 

   

in 2006 localcurrency sales growth of 77 was broadbased all business segments made positive contributions to localcurrency sales growth and have done so for three consecutive years acquisitions increased 2006 sales by 21 driven by the august 2005 acquisition of cuno and the august 2006 acquisition of security printing and systems limited refer to both the “performance by business segment” and “performance by geographic area” sections for additional discussion of sales change 

operating expenses 

   

the dollar impact of stockbased compensation by major caption for the consolidated statement of income is provided in note 1 as discussed in the preceding overview section the gain on sale restructuring and other items benefited 2006 operating income by 523 million or 22 of net sales the following table summarizes these impacts by operating expense category additional details on restructuring actions are in note 4 i tems included in the “other” category of the table are acquired inprocess research and development expenses 95 million settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action 40 million and environmental obligations related to the pharmaceuticals business 13 million refer to note 2 and note 13 for additional details on these items 

   

cost of sales 

cost of sales increased 19 percentage points in 2006 approximately 12 percentage points of this increase related to numerous items such as higher raw material costs slightly lower selling prices and higher costs associated with scaling up additional manufacturing capacity in addition there were supply chain inefficiencies caused by capacityconstraints finally we accelerated the pace of acquisitions in 2006 which increased cost of sales slightly for the year after these acquisitions are integrated and begin meaningful contributions to growth we expect positive impacts broadbased sales volume growth and productivity gains helped offset some of this impact raw material costs increased approximately 3 for 2006 compared with 2005 restructuring and other items also negatively impacted cost of sales by 143 million or 07 percentage points cost of sales includes manufacturing engineering and freight costs 

cost of sales decreased 08 of a percentage point in 2005 cost of sales as a percentage of net sales benefited from the combination of improved selling prices favorable product mix productivity gains factory efficiency and sourcing which helped offset the impact of higher raw material prices raw material costs increased approximately 6 for 2005 compared with 2004 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 02 of a percentage point compared with the same period in 2005 in dollars sga increased 435 million with restructuring and other items increasing sga by 238 million and other spending increasing sga by 197 million 3m continues to invest in growthoriented sga as sales and marketing costs increased faster than sales while administrative expenses remained relatively flat in dollars attributable in part to costcontrol efforts

performance by geographic area 

financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 18 a summary of key information and discussion related to 3m’s geographic areas follow 

   

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of enduser consumption in that geographic area

than 20 in 2006 the increase in 2005 compared with 2004 of approximately 3000 people was primarily attributable to the august 2005 acquisition of cuno which added approximately 2300 employees employment increases at a manufacturing plant in latin america also contributed to increases of approximately 600 people and 700 people in 2006 and 2005 respectively sales per employee in local currencies increased 77 in 2006 approximately 3 in 2005 and approximately 7 in 2004 

capital spendingnet property plant and equipment 

the bulk of 3m capital spending historically has been in the united states resulting in higher net property plant and equipment balances in the united states the company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales and because more than 60 of sales are outside the united states this would increase production outside the united states helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital requirements 

capital expenditures are expected to increase from this 1168 billion in 2006 to 14 billion to 15 billion in 2007 the majority of this spending is aimed directly at accelerating topline growth in many of our core businesses 3m has about 15 significant plant construction projects under way some adding to existing facilities and a few of the greenfield variety internationally 3m is building respiratory protection capacity in russia and korea medical products capacity in china an lcd plant in poland abrasives and tape capacity in china and india and chemical facilities in china just to name a few this is backed up by similar investments in the us 

critical accounting estimates 

information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations and asset impairments senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

legal proceedings 

the categories of claims for which the company has estimated its probable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 13 for additional information about such estimates 

pension and postretirement obligations 

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas no 106 “employer’s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost and sfas no 158 “employer’s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” which was issued in september 2006 and effective as of december 31 2006 sfas no 158 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity as a result of the implementation of sfas no 158 the company recognized an aftertax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of 1187 billion and 513 million for the us and international pension benefit plans respectively and 218 million for the postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan 

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and liability measurement the assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption see note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at 

rates of return on fixedincome investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies using this methodology the company determined a discount rate of 575 to be appropriate as of december 31 2006 which is an increase of 025 of a percentage point from the rate used as of december 31 2005 

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 87 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the us pension plan the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 875 for 2006 and will remain at 875 for 2007 refer to note 11 for information on how this rate is determined

for the year ended december 31 2006 the company recognized total consolidated pretax pension expense after settlements curtailments and special termination benefits of 347 million up from 331 million in 2005 pension expense before settlements curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to decrease to approximately 174 million in 2007 for the pension plans holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by 025 of a percentage point would decreaseincrease us 2007 pension expense by approximately 24 million for us pension plans and approximately 9 million for international pension plans also holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 025 of a percentage point would decreaseincrease 2006 pension expense by approximately 32 million for us pension plans and approximately 17 million for international pension plans see note 11 for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation

3m goodwill totaled approximately 41 billion as of december 31 2006 which based on impairment testing is not impaired impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level reporting units are one level below the business segment level but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics the majority of goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48 fin 48 prescribes a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures this interpretation is effective as of january 1 2007 and the cumulative effects if any of applying this interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of january 1 2007 the company does not expect the adoption of fin 48 to have a material impact on 3m’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition

additional information regarding other accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 

financial condition and liquidity 

the company generates significant ongoing cash flow net debt increased slightly in 2006 primarily related to increased shortterm debt supporting share repurchase activities and acquisitions the increase in 2005 primarily related to the 136 billion cuno acquisition 

 

  

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31 2006 were higher compared with december 31 2005 due to the significant pharmaceuticals sales proceeds received in december 2006 3m believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected investments and capital expenditures the company has an aa credit rating from standard  poor’s and an aa1 credit rating from moody’s investors service the company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the company’s stock however the company does have contingently convertible debt that if conditions for conversion are met is convertible into shares of 3m common stock refer to note 10 in this document 

the company’s financial condition and liquidity are strong various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled 1623 billion at december 31 2006 compared with 1877 billion at december 31 2005 this decrease was primarily related to an increase in debt classified as shortterm borrowings and current portion of longterm debt partially offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and inventories 

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index which includes accounts receivables inventory and accounts payable this combined index defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at yearend — multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable was 54 at december 31 2006 down from 57 at december 31 2005 receivables increased 264 million or 93 compared with december 31 2005 currency translation due to the stronger us dollar increased accounts receivable by 113 million yearonyear inventories increased 439 million or 203 compared with december 31 2005 currency translation increased inventories by 92 million yearonyear accounts payable increased 146 million compared with december 31 2005 with 53 million of this yearonyear increase related to currency translation 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions divestitures and exchange rate impacts which are presented separately in the cash flows thus the amounts presented in the following operating investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

  

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows in 2006 cash flows provided by operating activities decreased 365 million this decrease was due in large part to an increase of approximately 600 million in tax payments in 2006 compared with 2005 the higher tax payments in 2006 primarily related to the company’s repatriation of 17 billion of foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the category “othernet” in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts including outstanding liabilities at december 31 2006 related to 3m’s restructuring actions note 4 

in 2005 cash flow was essentially flat when compared with 2004 higher net income higher accounts payable and increased insurance receivable collections were offset by accounts receivable increases inventory increases and other items product and other insurance receivables and claims increased cash flow by 122 million in 2005 benefiting from the 148 million in insurance recoveries for the breast implant matter in 2005 the category “other — net” in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts for example in 2005 this category includes the noncash impact of adopting fin 47 35 million cumulative effect of accounting change increases in accrued liabilities such as the 30 million increase in liability related to legal settlement agreements and other items 

in the third quarter of 2006 the company made discretionary contributions totaling 200 million to its us qualified pension plan in 2005 the company made discretionary contributions totaling 500 million to its us qualified pension plan with 200 million contributed in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 300 million contributed in the third quarter of 2005 in the third quarter of 2004 the company made a special pension contribution to 3m’s japanese pension plan of 155 million and a discretionary contribution of 300 million to its us qualified pension plan future contributions will depend on market conditions interest rates and other factors 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities

cash flows from financing activities 

 

  

total debt at december 31 2006 was 3553 billion up from 2381 billion at yearend 2005 with the increase primarily attributable to commercial paper issuances and the november 2006 issuance of a threeyear 400 million mediumterm note in 2006 the increase in net shortterm debt of 882 million includes the portion of shortterm debt with original maturities of 90 days or less which primarily represents commercial paper activity the repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90 days also primarily relates to commercial paper activity total debt was 26 of total capital total capital is defined as debt plus equity compared with 19 at yearend 2005 

debt securities including the company’s shelf registration its mediumterm notes program dealer remarketable securities and convertible note are all discussed in more detail in note 10 3m has a shelf registration and mediumterm notes program through which 15 billion of mediumterm notes may be offered in november 2006 the company issued 400 million under its mediumterm notes program in 2004 the company issued approximately 62 million in debt securities under this program the mediumterm notes program and shelf registration have remaining capacity of approximately 1038 billion t he company’s 350 million of dealer remarketable securities classified as current portion of longterm debt were remarketed for one year in december 2006 in addition the company has convertible notes with a book value of 542 million at december 31 2006 the next put option date for these convertible notes is november 2007 at december 31 2006 the convertible notes dealer remarketable securities 62 million of mediumterm notes and 71 million of floating rate notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments for a discussion of accounting pronouncements that will affect accounting treatment for the convertible note refer to note 1 for discussion of eitf 

issue no 0408 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” and proposed sfas no 128r “earnings per share” 

repurchases of common stock are made to support the company’s stockbased employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes on february 13 2006 the board of directors authorized the purchase of 20 billion of the company’s common stock between february 13 2006 and february 28 2007 on august 15 2006 the board of directors authorized an additional 1 billion in share repurchases raising the total authorization to 3 billion for the period from february 13 2006 to february 28 2007 as of december 31 2006 748 million remained available for repurchase refer to the table captioned “issuer purchases of equity securities” in part ii item 5 for more information

liquidity 

the company’s liquidity remains strong cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31 2006 were higher when compared with december 31 2005 due to the significant pharmaceuticals sales proceeds received in december 2006 primary shortterm liquidity needs are provided through us commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances as of december 31 2006 outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled 1349 billion and averaged approximately 1080 billion during 2006 mediumterm note shelf borrowing capacity totaled 1038 billion as of december 31 2006 credit support for outstanding commercial paper is provided by a 565 million credit agreement among a group of primary relationship banks in march 2005 the company replaced its 364day credit agreement with a fiveyear credit agreement with similar terms this 565 million credit facility provides up to 115 million in letters of credit 98 million of which was utilized at december 31 2006 with provisions for increasing this limit up to 150 million committed credit facilities of 55 million are in place across several international subsidiary locations 9 million of which was utilized at december 31 2006 to benefit from the sec securities offering reform rules applicable to wellknown seasoned issuers the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec on february 24 2006 which became effective automatically to register an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales no securities were issued off this shelf the company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes

the company believes it unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted cash and cash equivalents and certain other current assets could provide additional liquidity to meet nearterm obligations if necessary at december 31 2006 certain debt agreements 350 million of dealer remarketable securities and 127 million of esop debt had ratings triggers bbbbaa3 or lower that would require repayment of debt the company currently has aaaa1 debt ratings in addition the 565 million fiveyear credit agreement requires 3m to maintain a capitalization ratio at no more than 060 to 1 at the end of each quarter this ratio is calculated as funded debt including all borrowed money and letters of credit utilized to the sum of funded debt and equity at december 31 2006 this ratio was approximately 027 to 1 

3m’s cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2006 totaled 1447 billion with an additional 637 million in current and longterm marketable securities 3m’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth including continual review of acquisition opportunities 3m paid dividends of 1376 billion in 2006 and has a long history of dividend increases in february 2007 the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by 43 to 48 cents per share equivalent to an annual dividend of 192 per share in february 2007 3m’s board of directors also authorized a 7 billion twoyear share repurchase authorization for the period from february 12 2007 to february 28 2009 

in 2007 the company expects to contribute an amount in the range of 100 million to 400 million to its us and international pension plans the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2007 therefore the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the usplans funding status as of the 2007 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2006 the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements 3m’s accrued product warranty liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of current and longterm liabilities are estimated at approximately 25 million 3m does not consider this amount to be material  the fair value of 3m guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material 

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require 3m to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe third party patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 follows 

   

longterm debt payments due in 2007 include 542 million of convertible notes final maturity 2032 350 million of dealer remarketable securities final maturity 2010 62 million of mediumterm notes final maturity 2044 42 million of floating rate notes final maturity 2037 and 29 million of floating rate notes final maturity 2027 these securities are classified as the current portion of longterm debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments 

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

as discussed in note 11 the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2007 thus company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2007 and future years contractual capital commitments are also included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2007 and beyond 

financial instruments 

the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure interest rate risks and commodity price risks a financial risk management committee composed of senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities this committee determines the company’s financial risk policies and objectives and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation risk analysis counterparty credit approval and ongoing monitoring and reporting 

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in aftertax earnings of financial instruments derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2006 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 confidence level over a 12month time horizon the model used analyzed seventeen currencies interest rates related to three currencies and five commodities but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to aftertax earnings related to these exposures concerning interest rates the larger effect on earnings at december 31 2006 is due to the company’s increased floating interest rate exposure 

 

  

the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1 price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 55 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a 10 price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 35 million per year derivative instruments are used to hedge less than 2 of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 of this energy exposure

raw materials 

in 2005 t he company experienced both price increases and supply limitations affecting several oilderived raw materials but to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of such materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have hurricanes katrina and rita resulted in tight supply conditions and significant increases in energy costs fuel surcharges and prices for certain natural gas and petroleum related raw materials 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

environmental law compliance 

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to “environmental liabilities and insurance receivables” in note 11 commitments and contingencies 

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed liabilities for remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2005 3m expended about 26 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment the comparable amount in 2004 was about 67 million these amounts exclude expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s policies stressing environmental responsibility capital expenditures other than for remediation projects for known projects are presently expected to be about 35 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 

  

while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the most significant risk factors applicable to the company are as follows 

  

• results are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic conditions  the company operates in more than 60 countries and derives approximately 60 of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business may be affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region or in the various industries in which the company operates social political or labor conditions in a specific country or region or potential adverse changes in tax in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 

  

• the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences  demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins is affected by i the development and timing of introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals  and iv changes in customers’ preferences for our products including changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

  

• foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings because the company derives approximately 60 of its revenues from outside the united states its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 

  

• the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection gain market acceptance of new products or successfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals for example new 3m pharmaceutical products like any pharmaceutical under development face substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of development and regulatory review there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 

  

• the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives due to shortages increased demand supply interruptions currency exchange risks natural disasters and other factors  the company depends on various components compounds raw materials and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products and it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events or terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

• acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results  the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions strategic alliances divestitures and changes to its organizational structure with respect to acquisitions future results will be affected by the company’s ability to quickly integrate an acquired business and obtain the anticipated synergies 

  

• the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates less productivity improvements than estimated  the company utilizes various tools such as six sigma to improve operational efficiency and productivity there can be no assurance that all of the estimated productivity improvements will be realized 

  

• the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving product liability antitrust environmental or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not 

  

  

susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment significant settlement significant regulatory development or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period a specific factor that could increase the company’s estimate of its future asbestosrelated liabilities is the pending congressional consideration of legislation to reform asbestosrelated litigation and pertinent information derived from that process for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and associated accounting estimates see the discussion in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k

the following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended december 31 

  

   

3m’s performance in 2005 was broadbased with all seven business segments contributing to positive localcurrency sales growth sales growth in health care was led by 3m’s core medical and dental businesses and strong growth in health information systems which helped overcome the growth challenges of the pharmaceuticals and personal care businesses sales growth in the industrial segment was led by industrial adhesives and tapes as well as the abrasives businesses the cuno acquisition added 51 to industrial sales growth display and graphics sales growth in display enhancement films used in flatpanel devices was partially offset by the continued decline in lens systems for 

  

  

the crt rear projection television market along with the phase out of the commercial videotape business sales growth in the consumer and office segment was broadbased across the many channels 3m serves most notably in the massmarket consumer and home improvement retail channels for the electro and communications segment sales growth was led by demand for 3m electronic products for the semiconductor manufacturers along with continued strong growth in electrical products for insulating testing and sensing sales growth in the safety security and protection services segment was driven by continued strong demand for personal protection products and solutions particularly respiratory protection products along with strong demand for cleaning and protection products for commercial buildings sales growth in the transportation segment was led by both the automotive oem and repair markets refer to the performance by business segment section for a more detailed discussion of the results of the respective segments 

  

geographically us sales revenue increased 49 asia pacific localcurrency sales which exclude translation impacts increased 106 european localcurrency sales increased 09 and the combined latin america and canada area localcurrency sales increased 13 refer to the performance by geographic area section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective areas 

  

operating income in 2005 increased by 94 versus 2004 as all seven business segments posted increases the combination of solid sales growth and positive benefits from corporate initiatives helped drive the increase in operating income the company estimates that cost reduction projects related to initiatives provided a combined incremental benefit to operating income of approximately 400 million in 2005 these initiatives contributed more than 400 million to operating income in both 2004 and 2003 

  

3m generated 4258 billion of operating cash flows in 2005 essentially flat when compared to 2004 and ended the year with 1072 billion of cash and cash equivalents in 2005 the company utilized approximately 36 billion of cash to repurchase 3m common stock under its share repurchase authorization and to pay dividends and contributed 788 million to its pension and postretirement plans 3m’s debt to total capital ratio total capital defined as debt plus equity as of december 31 2005 was approximately 19 3m has an aa credit rating from standard  poor’s and an aa1 credit rating from moody’s investors service 

  

the company experienced both price increases and supply limitations affecting several oilderived raw materials in 2005 which is expected to carry forward into 2006 but to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of such materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have hurricanes katrina and rita resulted in tight supply conditions and significant increases in energy costs fuel surcharges and prices for certain natural gas and petroleumrelated raw materials and their derivatives 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact results although the company minimizes this effect through hedging about half of this impact 3m will also continue as it has for many years to incur expenses insured and uninsured in managing its litigation and environmental contingencies 

  

in 2006 3m expects to drive profitable growth by investing in its most promising commercialization geographic and technology opportunities with part of this investment coming from savings generated through continuous operational improvements the company expects solid sales growth across the majority of its business portfolio the company’s long history and unique ability to match technological solutions with the needs of its customers has resulted in a steady flow of new products and solutions with this trend expected to continue in 2006 in addition the company’s increasing focus on products and solutions for emerging economies such as asia and eastern europe is expected to foster significant growth in 2006 the company expects to increase both research and development and capital expenditures in 2006 led primarily by growth programs research development and related expenses totaled 1242 billion in 2005 or 59 of sales the company expects 2006 capital expenditures to total approximately 11 billion compared with 943 million in 2005 providing the capacity to meet expected growth 

  

while 3m anticipates solid sales growth across the majority of its businesses sales are expected to decline in a few of its businesses in health care 3m expects continued solid growth in its core medical and dental businesses as 3m continues to invest in fast growth areas such as the alternate care segment in medical digital dentistry and emerging markets however 3m expects declines in its personal care business which will become part of the combined industrial and transportation segment in 2006 and in its branded pharmaceuticals business health care to persist throughout 2006 3m experienced a sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2005 for metrogelvaginal a women’s health care product due to a competitive product 3m now expects that there will be a generic 

  

  

substitute approved for metrogelvaginal which accounts for approximately 2 of total health care sales in mid 2006 health care sales for 3m’s aldara™ imiquimod pharmaceutical product for the actinic keratosis a precancerous skin condition indication has and is expected to continue to fall short of expectations 3m had at the time of fda approval and 3m is currently reassessing aldara’s total market potential in display and graphics 3m expects the continued negative impact from the crt rear projection lens business to continue into the first half of 2006 with sales in the second half of 2006 expected to be comparable to the second half of 2005 however in display and graphics 3m expects this decline in crt rear projection lens sales to be more than offset by strong sales growth in display enhancement films used in flatpanel devices such as lcd televisions

results of operations 

  

net sales 

  

   

in 2005 localcurrency sales growth was broad based with selling prices increasing 06 along with the benefits provided by 3m’s sourcing initiative 3m’s pricing strategy has been key to maintaining margins in the face of significant raw material price pressure 3m’s pricing strategy resulted in us price growth of 25 in 2005 internationally selling prices declined 07 in 2005 adjusting for the price decreases in consumer electronics related businesses lcd films and flex circuits international pricing would have increased 03 in 2005 acquisitions increased 2005 sales by 10 driven by the 2005 acquisition of cuno refer to both the “performance by business segment” and “performance by geographic area” sections for additional discussion of sales change 

  

  

in 2004 core volume growth which excludes the impact of businesses acquired in the last 12 months was broadbased with all seven businesses posting worldwide localcurrency sales growth localcurrency growth was led by display and graphics industrial consumer and office safety security and protection services and the transportation businesses health care localcurrency sales increased 17 as results were negatively impacted by 2003 sales from pharmaceutical and drug delivery agreements that did not repeat in 2004 electro and communications localcurrency sales increased 27 the first year of positive localcurrency sales growth since 2000 acquisitions increased 2004 sales by 05 driven by the 2004 acquisitions of highjump software inc and hornell holding ab internationally selling prices declined 11 with most of the decline coming in certain businesses that serve the electronics industry where it is important to look at the combined impact of volume and price on a geographic basis localcurrency sales growth in 2004 was led by the asia pacific area 

  

operating expenses 

  

   

cost of sales 

cost of sales decreased 08 percentage points in 2005 cost of sales as a percent of net sales benefited from the combination of improved selling prices favorable product mix productivity gains factory efficiency and sourcing which helped offset the impact of higher raw material prices raw material costs increased approximately 60 for 2005 when compared to 2004 with this impact mitigated through commodity hedging programs and negotiated supply contracts cost of sales includes manufacturing engineering and freight costs 

  

the 2004 decrease as a percent of net sales was driven by a combination of higher volumes productivity gains ongoing benefits of corporate initiatives and positive currency impacts including hedging impacts while 3m raw material costs increased during the year 3m’s global sourcing initiative was important in enabling 3m to minimize raw material cost increases during a period of commodity price inflation 

  

research development and related expenses 

research development and related expenses as a percent of sales were flat when comparing 2005 to 2004 however spending in dollars increased approximately 4 reflecting 3m’s continuing commitment to fund future growth for the company 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses as a percent of net sales were flat when comparing 2005 to 2004 3m continues to invest in growth programs and brand building throughout the portfolio as a means of stimulating growth sga in the fourth quarter of 2005 was impacted by a pretax charge of approximately 30 million in connection with settlement agreements of one pending lepage’s followon class actions and of two individual followon actions all involving direct purchasers of transparent tape for more detail refer to the discussion in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

selling general and administrative expenses improved by 05 percentage points in 2004 compared to 2003 the improvement in 2004 as a percent of net sales was helped by leverage related to 3m’s strong growth in the asia pacific area sga expenses in us dollars increased in 2004 negatively impacted by currency translation and increased advertising and merchandising spending to support 3m’s strong brand portfolio on an ongoing basis the company is shifting sga dollars toward fastergrowth businesses and geographic areas 

  

other expense 

in 2003 3m recorded pretax charges of 93 million 58 million aftertax related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against 3m in 1997 by lepage’s inc the pretax charge of 93 million is classified as “other expense” within operating income 

  

  

operating income 

3m uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools operating income in 2005 was 237 of sales up from 229 of sales in 2004 and 204 of sales in 2003 operating income in 2005 grew by 431 million or 94 percent following 2004 operating income growth of 865 million or 233 percent the lepage’s inc lawsuit negatively impacted operating income in 2003 by 93 million or 05 of sales 

  

interest expense and income 

  

   

interest expense  interest expense increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to higher interest rates the decrease in 2004 interest expense was primarily the result of lower average debt balances partially offset by higher interest rates in the united states 

interest income interest income was higher in 2005 benefiting primarily from higher interest rates interest income increased in 2004 due to substantially higher cash balances 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

   

the tax rate for 2005 was 340 compared with 330 in 2004 during 2005 3m completed its evaluation of the repatriation provision of the american jobs creation act of 2004 jobs act and repatriated approximately 18 billion of foreign earnings into the us pursuant to its provisions the jobs act provides 3m the opportunity to tax effectively repatriate foreign earnings for us qualifying investments specified by 3m’s domestic reinvestment plan as a consequence in the second quarter of 2005 3m recorded a tax expense of 75 million net of available foreign tax credits which negatively impacted the 2005 effective worldwide tax rate by 15 a halfpoint tax rate reduction compared to the same periods last year is primarily attributable to the combination of the effects of the medicare modernization act and the domestic manufacturer’s deduction which was a part of the jobs act

cumulative effect of accounting change 

as of december 31 2005 the company adopted fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” fin 47 this accounting standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and where the liability can be reasonably estimated conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain of the company’s longterm assets the fair value of these obligations is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in the present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets the adoption of fin 47 resulted in the recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of 59 million and an after tax charge of 35 million which is reflected as a cumulative change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income the pro forma effect of applying this guidance in all prior periods presented was determined not to be material

performance by geographic area 

financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements a summary of key information and discussion related to 3m’s geographic areas follow 

  

   

  

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure export sales are reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another 3m’s results will follow thus net sales in a particular geography is not indicative of enduser consumption in that geography

capital spendingnet property plant and equipment 

the bulk of 3m capital spending historically has been in the united states resulting in higher net property plant and equipment balances in the us the company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales and because approximately 61 of sales are outside the united states this would increase production outside the united states helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital requirements the 2005 decrease in net property plant and equipment in the europe middle east and africa area was primarily due to c urrency translation due to the stronger us dollar at december 31 2005 when compared to december 31 2004 capital spending in asia has more than doubled since 2003 as we continue to grow our presence in this region 

  critical accounting estimates information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as stated in note 1 the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

  

the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings the company’s pension and postretirement obligations and potential asset impairment issues senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m’s board of directors 

  

legal proceedings the categories of claims for which the company has estimated its probable liability the amount of its liability accruals and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled “accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” contained in “legal proceedings” in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about such estimates 

  

pension and postretirement obligations 

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employer’s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” which require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and liability measurement the assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 

  

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on fixedincome investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies using these methodologies the company determined a discount rate of 550 to be appropriate as of december 31 2005 which is a reduction of 025 percentage points from the rate used as of december 31 2004 

  

as of december 31 2005 the company converted to the rp retirement plans 2000 mortality table for calculating the yearend 2005 us pension and postretirement obligations and 2006 expense the impact of this change increased the yearend 2005 us projected benefit obligations for pension by 385 million the yearend 2005 us accumulated benefit obligations for pension by 349 million and the 2005 us accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 93 million this change will also increase pension expenses for 2006 by 64 million and postretirement expenses by 17 million 

  

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 87 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes for the us pension plan the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 875 for 2005 and will remain at 875 for 2006 refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on how this rate is determined 

  

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and under certain circumstances amortized over future years of service therefore the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2005 the company had net unrecognized pension actuarial losses of 2676 billion and 954 million for the us and international pension benefit plans respectively and 1005 billion for the postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan these amounts represent potential future pension and postretirement expenses that would be amortized over average future service periods the average remaining service periods for us and international pension plans and the postretirement plans are 102 years 141 years and 100 years respectively 

  

for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recognized total consolidated pretax pension expense after settlements curtailments and special termination benefits of 331 million up from 325 million in 2004 pension expense before settlements curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to decrease to approximately 300 million in 2006 for the pension plans holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by 025 percentage points would decreaseincrease us 2006 pension expense by approximately 22 million for us pension plans and approximately 7 million for 

  

  

international pension plans also holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 025 percentage points would decreaseincrease 2006 pension expense by approximately 31 million for us pension plans and approximately 7 million for international pension plans see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 

  

potential asset impairment issues 

3m net property plant and equipment totaled approximately 56 billion at december 31 2005 management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit 

  

3m goodwill totaled approximately 35 billion at december 31 2005 which based on impairment testing is not impaired impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level reporting units are one level below the business segment level but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 3m had 18 reporting units at december 31 2005 the majority of goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

as of december 31 2005 the company adopted fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” fin 47 this accounting standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and where the liability can be reasonably estimated conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain of the company’s longterm assets the fair value of these obligations is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in the present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets the adoption of fin 47 resulted in the recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of 59 million and an after tax charge of 35 million which is reflected as a cumulative change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income the pro forma effect of applying this guidance in all prior periods presented was determined not to be material 

  

effective january 1 2006 3m adopted sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” which requires 3m to expense stockbased compensation expense the company is adopting sfas no 123r using the modified retrospective method all prior periods will be adjusted to give effect to the fairvaluebased method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after january 1 1995 stockbased compensation disclosures in note 1 reflect pro forma expense of 14 cents per diluted share in 2005 the 2006 impact of adopting sfas no 123r is estimated to be approximately 16 per diluted share with an estimated 002 per diluted share cost in the first quarter an estimated 008 per diluted share cost in the second quarter and an estimated 003 per diluted share cost in both the third and fourth quarters the pro forma impact of stockbased compensation on net income and earnings per share provided in note 1 for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 was recognized over the nominal vesting period whereby if an employee retired before the end of the vesting period the company would recognize any remaining unrecognized compensation cost at the date of retirement sfas no 123r requires recognition under a nonsubstantive vesting period approach requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire 3m employees in the us are eligible to retire beginning at age 55 and after having completed five years of service approximately 25 to 30 of the number of stockbased compensation awards are made to this population the company will change to the nonsubstantive vesting period approach for new stock compensation grants made after the company’s adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 therefore primarily beginning in may 2006 with the annual management stock ownership program grant immediate expensing of those stockbased compensation awards granted to employees eligible to retire will result in a higher compensation expense than historically recognized in comparable prior periods the total expense in 2006 and beyond will depend on several variables including the number of sharebased awards granted the fair value of those awards and the period the vesting of those awards is recognized over therefore the actual expense may be different from this estimate 

  

additional information regarding these and other accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

financial condition and liquidity 

the company generates significant ongoing cash flow net debt decreased significantly in 2004 but increased in 2005 primarily related to the 136 billion cuno acquisition 

  

   

3m believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected investments and capital expenditures the company has an aa credit rating from standard  poor’s and an aa1 credit rating from moody’s investors service the company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the company’s stock however the company does have contingently convertible debt that if conditions for conversion are met is convertible into shares of 3m common stock refer to note 8 in this document 

  

the company’s financial condition and liquidity at december 31 2005 remained strong various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from monthtomonth depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled 1877 billion at december 31 2005 compared with 2649 billion at december 31 2004 this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents 1685 billion partially offset by a decrease in debt classified as shortterm borrowings and current portion of longterm debt 1022 billion the cash and cash equivalents balance was impacted by the acquisition of cuno and repayment of debt 

  

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index which includes accounts receivables inventory and accounts payable this combined index defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at yearend — multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable was 57 at december 31 2005 down from 58 at december 31 2004 excluding cuno net working capital turns at december 31 2005 were 58 the same as at december 31 2004 receivables increased 46 million or 16 compared with december 31 2004 at december 31 2005 the cuno acquisition increased accounts receivable by 88 million currency translation due to the stronger us dollar reduced accounts receivable by 231 million yearonyear inventories increased 265 million or 140 compared with december 31 2004 at december 31 2005 the cuno acquisition increased inventories by 56 million currency translation reduced inventories by 89 million yearonyear accounts payable increased 88 million compared with december 31 2004 with cuno accounting for 18 million of this increase 

  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions divestitures and exchange rate impacts which are presented separately in the cash flows thus the amounts presented in the following operating investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects 

  

  

cash flows from operating activities 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows in 2005 cash flow was essentially flat when compared to 2004 higher net income higher accounts payable and increased insurance receivable collections were offset by accounts receivable increases inventory increases and other items product and other insurance receivables and claims increased cash flow by 122 million in 2005 benefiting from the 148 million in insurance recoveries for the breast implant matter in 2005 for a more detailed discussion of these and other legal proceedings refer to note 11 in the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k the category “other — net” in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts for example in 2005 this category includes the noncash impact of adopting fin 47 35 million cumulative effect of accounting change increases in accrued liabilities such as the 30 million increase in liability related to legal settlement agreements and other items 

  

in 2005 the company made discretionary contributions totaling 500 million to its us qualified pension plan with 200 million contributed in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 300 million contributed in the third quarter of 2005 in the third quarter of 2004 the company made a special pension contribution to 3m’s japanese pension plan of 155 million and a discretionary contribution of 300 million to its us qualified pension plan in the third quarter of 2003 3m made a discretionary contribution of 600 million to its us qualified pension plan future contributions will depend on market conditions interest rates and other factors 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities 

  

in 2004 cash flow improvements were primarily driven by higher net income in all periods presented significant company pension contributions negatively impacted cash flows in all years with a larger amount in 2003 a portion of the tax timing benefit relates to the tax benefit received from company pension contributions 

  

cash flows from investing activities 

  

   

  

investments in property plant and equipment are enabling growth in diverse markets helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency these investments will continue to be primarily capacity and growth focused for example in december 2005 3m announced its intention to build an lcd optical film manufacturing facility in poland to support the fastgrowing lcdtv market in europe and to better serve its customers the company expects 2006 capital expenditures to total approximately 11 billion compared with 943 million in 2005 

  

in the third quarter of 2005 3m completed the acquisition of cuno 3m acquired cuno for approximately 136 billion including assumption of debt this 136 billion included 127 billion of cash paid net of cash acquired and the assumption of 80 million of debt most of which has been repaid in 2005 the company also entered into two additional business combinations for a total purchase price of 27 million refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these 2005 business combinations and for information concerning 2004 and 2003 business combinations 

  

purchases of investments in 2005 include the purchase from tim beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh of 19 percent of it innovation technology discussed previously under the transportation business segment the purchase price of approximately 55 million is reported as “investments” in the consolidated balance sheet and as “purchases of investments” in the consolidated statement of cash flows other “purchases of investments” and “proceeds from sale of investments” in 2005 are primarily attributable to auction rate securities which are classified as availableforsale prior to 2005 purchases of and proceeds from the sale of auction rate securities were classified as cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2004 the amount of such securities taken as a whole was immaterial to cash and cash equivalents and accordingly were not reclassified for 2004 and prior p roceeds from the sale of investments in 2003 include 26 million of cash received related to the sale of 3m’s 50 ownership in durel corporation to rogers corporation additional p urchases of investments totaled 5 million in 2005 10 million in 2004 and 16 million in 2003 these purchases include additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments 

  

the company is actively considering additional acquisitions investments and strategic alliances 

  

cash flows from financing activities 

  

   

total debt at december 31 2005 was 2381 billion down from 2821 billion at yearend 2004 with the decrease primarily attributable to the retirement of 400 million in mediumterm notes there were no new longterm debt issuances in 2005 in 2005 the cash flow decrease in net shortterm debt of 258 million includes the portion of shortterm debt with original maturities of 90 days or less the repayment of debt of 656 million primarily related to the retirement of 400 million in mediumterm notes and commercial paper retirements proceeds from debt of 429 million primarily related to commercial paper issuances total debt was 19 of total capital total capital is defined as debt plus equity compared with 21 at yearend 2004 

  

debt securities including the company’s shelf registration its mediumterm notes program dealer remarketable securities and convertible note are all discussed in more detail in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 3m has a shelf registration and mediumterm notes program through which 15 billion of mediumterm notes may be offered in 2004 the company issued approximately 62 million in debt securities under its mediumterm notes program no debt was issued under this program in 2005 the mediumterm notes program and shelf registration have remaining capacity of approximately 1438 billion t he company’s 350 million of dealer remarketable securities classified as current portion of longterm debt were remarketed for one year in december 2005 in addition the company has convertible notes with a book value of 539 million at december 31 2005 

  

  

the next put option date for these convertible notes is november 2007 thus at yearend 2005 this debt is classified as longterm debt at december 31 2005 the dealer remarketable securities and 62 million of mediumterm notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments for a discussion of accounting pronouncements that will affect accounting treatment for the convertible note refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of eitf issue no 0408 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” and proposed sfas no 128r “earnings per share” 

  

repurchases of common stock are made to support the company’s stockbased employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes on november 8 2004 the board of directors authorized the purchase of 20 billion of the company’s common stock between january 1 2005 and january 31 2006 in october 2005 3m’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 300 million of the company’s stock through january 31 2006 this increased the total repurchase authorization to 23 billion for the period through january 31 2006 as of december 31 2005 substantially all of this repurchase authorization had been utilized refer to the table captioned “issuer purchases of equity securities” in part ii item 5 for more information 

  

cash dividends paid to stockholders totaled 1286 billion 168 per share in 2005 1125 billion 144 per share in 2004 and 1034 billion 132 per share in 2003 3m has paid dividends since 1916 other cash flows from financing activities include distributions to minority interests changes in cash overdraft balances and principal payments for capital leases 

  

liquidity 

the company’s liquidity remains strong primary shortterm liquidity needs are provided through us commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances as of december 31 2005 outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled 514 million and averaged approximately 823 million during 2005 mediumterm note shelf borrowing capacity totaled 1438 billion as of december 31 2005 credit support for outstanding commercial paper is provided by a 565 million credit agreement among a group of primary relationship banks in march 2005 the company replaced its 364day credit agreement with a fiveyear credit agreement with similar terms this 565 million credit facility provides up to 115 million in letters of credit 97 million of which was utilized at december 31 2005 with provisions for increasing this limit up to 150 million committed credit facilities of 53 million are in place across several international subsidiary locations 

  

the company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted cash and cash equivalents and certain other current assets could provide additional liquidity to meet near term obligations if necessary at yearend 2005 certain debt agreements 350 million of dealer remarketable securities and 165 million of esop debt had ratings triggers bbbbaa3 or lower that would require repayment of debt the company currently has aaaa1 debt ratings in addition the 565 million fiveyear credit agreement requires 3m to maintain a capitalization ratio at no more than 060 to 1 at the end of each quarter this ratio is calculated as funded debt including all borrowed money and letters of credit utilized to the sum of funded debt and equity at december 31 2005 this ratio was approximately 020 to 1 

  

3m’s cash balance at december 31 2005 totaled 1072 billion 3m’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth including continual review of acquisition opportunities 3m paid dividends of 1286 billion in 2005 and has a long history of dividend increases in february 2006 the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by 95 to 46 cents per share equivalent to an annual dividend of 184 per share in february 2006 3m’s board of directors also authorized the purchase of up to 20 billion of the company’s common stock between february 13 2006 and february 28 2007 the company may also make additional contributions to its pension plan in the future but exact amounts are uncertain and will depend on market conditions 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2005 the company had not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements 3m’s accrued product warranty liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of current and longterm liabilities are estimated at approximately 22 million 3m does not consider this amount to be material  the fair value of 3m guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require 3m to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe third 

  

  

party patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 follows 

  

contractual obligations 

  

   

longterm debt payments due in 2006 include 350 million of dealer remarketable securities final maturity 2010 and 62 million of mediumterm notes final maturity 2044 these securities are classified as current portion of longterm debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments the next date on which investors can require repurchase of the convertible notes is 2007 thus in the above schedule this is considered due in 2007 final maturity 2032 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2006 thus company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2006 and future years contractual capital commitments are also included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2006 and beyond 

  

financial instruments 

the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure interest rate risks and commodity price risks a financial risk management committee composed of senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities this committee determines the company’s financial risk policies and objectives and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation risk analysis counterparty credit approval and ongoing monitoring and reporting 

  

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions in 2001 the company increased the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen yearoveryear impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings however this hedging program does not make 3m immune to currency impacts 

  

the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to 

  

  

an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 

  

a variancecovariance statistical modeling technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss in aftertax earnings of financial instruments derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2005 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 confidence level over a 12month time horizon based on this analysis of the company’s interest rate risks possible increases in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on aftertax earnings 2 million at december 31 2005 and 5 million at december 31 2004 a decrease in interest rates would have increased aftertax earnings by 2 million at december 31 2005 based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks possible changes in foreign exchange rates would have adversely impacted aftertax earnings by 69 million at december 31 2005 61 million at december 31 2004 a positive change in exchange rates would have benefited aftertax earnings by 66 million at december 31 2005 when including certain commodity risks possible changes in commodity rates would have adversely impacted aftertax earnings by an additional 4 million at december 31 2005 an additional 10 million at december 31 2004 a positive change in commodity rates would not have materially impacted aftertax earnings at december 31 2005 the model used analyzed over 20 different currencies and five commodities but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results 

  

the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 45 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a 10 price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 35 million per year derivative instruments are used to hedge less than two percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 of this energy exposure

environmental law compliance 

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national state and local environmental laws around the world 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to part i item 3 legal proceedings 

  

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

  

in 2004 3m expended about 17 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment the comparable amount in 2003 was about 40 million these amounts exclude expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices – such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers – at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s policies stressing environmental responsibility average annual capital expenditures other than for remediation projects are presently expected to be about 23 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions 

  

while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 3  legal proceedings 

  

the company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits principally in the united states and regulatory proceedings worldwide these include various products liability involving products that the company now or formerly manufactured and sold intellectual property and commercial claims and lawsuits including those brought under the antitrust laws and environmental proceedings the following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the company is involved and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance receivables the company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings unless otherwise stated the company is vigorously defending all such litigation 

  

antitrust litigation 

as previously reported lepage’s inc a transparent tape competitor of 3m filed a lawsuit against the company in june 1997 alleging that certain marketing practices of the company constituted unlawful monopolization under the antitrust laws as a result of an appeals court ruling 3m recorded a charge of 93 million pretax in the first quarter of 2003 on june 30 2004 the supreme court denied 3m’s petition to review the appeals court ruling which concluded the lepage’s lawsuit against 3m the company paid lepage’s 965 million for the judgment interest and attorneys’ fees on july 2 2004 

  

following the lepage’s verdict and appellate rulings certain direct and indirect tape purchasers filed multiple purported class actions and one individual action against the company in various state and federal courts twelve putative class actions brought on behalf of indirect purchasers of tape are now pending in california pennsylvania florida tennessee wisconsin kansas south carolina new mexico and iowa and two brought on behalf of direct purchasers are pending in the federal court in philadelphia some of the pending actions were filed in the fourth quarter of 2004 and one was filed in january 2005 these cases allege that the company competed unfairly and unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for transparent tape and they seek to recover on behalf of variously defined classes of direct and indirect purchasers damages in the form of price overcharges the company allegedly charged for these products in the case in federal court in california in which the lower court had previously granted the company’s motion for summary judgment the ninth circuit court of appeals granted the parties’ joint request to hold the plaintiffs’ appeal of the summary judgment ruling in abeyance pending settlement discussions 

  

3m has reached a proposed settlement in february 2005 with all named plaintiffs in the 12 indirect purchaser antitrust putative class actions pending against the company in the various state courts noted above and in the california federal court if an agreement is executed by the parties and receives federal court approval and all conditions in the agreement are satisfied the settlement would terminate all 12 actions and release the claims of class members nationwide the amount of the proposed settlement is not material to 3m the proposed settlement does not affect the class and individual actions brought by direct purchasers of 3m transparent tape that are pending in a federal court in pennsylvania and does not constitute any admission of liability by the company 

  

pretrial proceedings continue in the direct purchaser class action pending in the federal court in philadelphia in august 2004 that court certified a class consisting of all 3m customers who directly bought transparent and invisible tape but not private label tape from october 1998 to the present thereafter two additional lawsuits were filed against the company by alleged direct tape purchasers in the federal court in philadelphia in one the plaintiff opted out of the class described above and filed an individual lawsuit in september 2004 in the other the plaintiff filed a purported class action in december 2004 on behalf of customers private label tape purchasers excluded from the august class certification order the company has moved to dismiss that action as untimely and on other grounds 

  

breast implant litigation 

the company and certain other companies were named as defendants in a number of claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from breast implants formerly manufactured by the company or a related company the vast majority of claims against the company have been resolved the company does not consider its remaining probable liability to be material information concerning the associated insurance receivable and legal proceedings related to it follows in the paragraph entitled breast implant insurance receivables  

  

respirator maskasbestos litigation 

for more than 25 years the company has defended and resolved the claims of over 340000 individual claimants alleging injuries from occupational dust exposures as of december 31 2004 the company is a named defendant with multiple codefendants in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 76600 individual claimants a decrease from the approximately 88700 individual claimants with actions pending at december 31 2003 

  

  

the vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the company allege use of some of the company’s mask and respirator products and seek damages from the company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos silica coal or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace the remaining claimants generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the company which are often unspecified and by other defendants or occasionally at company premises 

  

in many of these lawsuits and claims the company is named as a defendant with multiple codefendants where no product the company manufactured is involved or where the company is ultimately determined not to have manufactured the products identified by the plaintiffs the company’s vigorous defense of this litigation has resulted in i dismissals of many lawsuits without any payment by the company ii an average settlement value of less than 1000 per claimant for all of the claims and lawsuits that the company has resolved including those dismissed without payment and iii jury verdicts for the company in six of the seven cases tried to verdict and an appellate reversal of the one jury verdict adverse to the company 

  

on january 20 2005 the mississippi supreme court reversed the 225 million jury verdict adverse to the company that was returned in holmes county mississippi in 2001 the supreme court ruled in part that the plaintiffs failed to prove any claim against the company’s respiratory products and in effect that the trial judge should not have submitted the case to the jury in the first place the mississippi supreme court’s decision is final and terminates the claims of the plaintiffs against the company it will not affect 3m’s earnings or reserves on february 3 2005 the plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing with the mississippi supreme court to which the company opposed 

  

of the claims currently pending against the company noted above the company joined other defendants in removing approximately 7600 silicarelated claims from certain mississippi state courts to the united states district courts for the northern and southern district of mississippi these claims were subsequently consolidated before a single federal court in the southern district of texas corpus christi for coordinated pretrial proceedings the company has manufactured and continues to manufacture certain products that contain silica but does not believe these products pose a health risk to any user or bystander when used as intended the company understands that the vast majority of these claims however are based on alleged use of some of the company’s mask and respirator products 

  

plaintiffs have asserted specific dollar claims for damages in approximately 57 of the 10967 lawsuits that were pending against the company at the end of 2004 in all jurisdictions a majority of states restrict or prohibit specifying damages in tort cases such as these and most of the remaining jurisdictions do not require such specification in those cases in which plaintiffs choose to assert specific dollar amounts in their complaints brought in states that permit such pleading the amounts claimed are typically not meaningful as an indicator of the company’s potential liability this is because a the amounts claimed typically bear no relation to the extent of the plaintiff’s injury if any b the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants with the typical complaint asserting claims against more than 50 different defendants the damages alleged are not attributed to individual defendants and a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability which can vary by state and by the amount of fault a jury allocates to each defendant if a case is ultimately tried before a jury c many cases are filed against the company even though the plaintiffs did not use any of the company’s products and ultimately are withdrawn or dismissed without any payment and d many cases are brought on behalf of plaintiffs who have not suffered any medical injury and ultimately are resolved without any payment or a payment that is a small fraction of the damages initially claimed of the 6248 pending cases in which purported damage amounts are specified in the complaints 5383 cases involve claims of 100000 or less two of these cases also allege punitive damages of 10000 and 75000 respectively 215 cases involve claims between 100000 and 3 million 83 of these cases also each allege punitive damages of 250000 one of them also alleges punitive damages of 1 million 46 of them also each allege punitive damages of 15 million 72 of them each allege punitive damages of 2 million and one of them also alleges punitive damages of 3 million 62 cases involve claims of 75 million one case has claims of 87 million and alleges punitive damages of 5 million 519 cases involve claims of 10 million one of these cases also alleges punitive damages of 350000 and 446 of them also each allege 10 million in punitive damages 16 cases involve claims of 15 million 14 of these cases also each allege 15 million in punitive damages 50 cases involve claims of 20 million all of which also allege an equal amount in punitive damages and two cases involve claims of 50 million one of which also alleges punitive damages of 50 million some complaints allege that the compensatory and punitive damages are at least the amounts specified as previously stated the company has more than 25 years of experience in defending litigation of this type has resolved the claims of over 340000 individuals with a cumulative average settlement amount of less than 1000 per claimant and based on this experience and for the other reasons cited 

  

  

believes that the damage amounts specified in complaints are not a meaningful factor in any assessment of the company’s potential liability 

  

the state of west virginia through its attorney general filed a complaint in 2003 against the company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the circuit court of lincoln county west virginia the complaint seeks substantial but unspecified compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the state for worker’s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to more than 20000 current or former miners allegedly suffering from silicosis andor coal miner’s pneumoconiosis “black lung disease” the complaint also seeks unquantified punitive damages on january 25 2005 the federal court to which the company and the codefendants removed the case granted the state of west virginia’s motion to remand the case to the state court where the case was originally filed the company and the codefendants have filed a motion to dismiss the case 

  

employment litigation 

on december 21 2004 one current and one former employee of the company filed a purported class action in the district court of ramsey county minnesota seeking to represent a class of all salaried employees employed by 3m in minnesota below a certain salary grade who were age 46 or older at any time during the applicable period to be determined by the court the complaint alleges the plaintiffs suffered various forms of employment discrimination on the basis of age in violation of the minnesota human rights act and seeks unspecified injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages in excess of 50000 per plaintiff and class member 

  

environmental matters and litigation 

the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations enforceable by national state and local authorities around the world and private parties in the united states and abroad including those pertaining to air emissions wastewater discharges toxic substances and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes these laws and regulations provide under certain circumstances a basis for the remediation of contamination as well as personal injury and property damage claims the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations defending personal injury and property damage claims and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities in its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations the company has established and periodically updates policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide 

  

remediation  under certain environmental laws including the united states comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and similar state laws the company may be jointly and severally liable typically with other companies for the costs of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at offsite locations the company has identified numerous locations most of which are in the united states at which it may have some liability please refer to the following section “accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” for more information on this subject

  

regulatory activities  the company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local state national primarily the us environmental protection agency epa and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of perfluorooctanyl compounds perflurooctanoic acid or “pfoa” and perfluorooctane sulfonate or “pfos” as a result of its phaseout decision in may 2000 the company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl compounds except that a subsidiary recycles pfoa for its manufacturing operations

  

the previously disclosed epa consent order negotiating process to obtain additional information to enable the epa to further develop a human health risk assessment and identify routes of exposure concerning pfoa is in progress the epa signed a memorandum of understanding with the company and dyneon llc a subsidiary of the company on october 25 2004 under which the company is monitoring at and around the company’s manufacturing facility in decatur alabama the potential presence of pfoa 

  

on january 12 2005 the epa issued a draft risk assessment for pfoa and submitted it for review to a science advisory board that the epa empanelled the epa document expresses the epa’s preliminary assessment in terms of the margin of exposure between the levels of that compound that cause adverse health effects in laboratory animals and the levels found in human blood sera in the us population 

  

on october 2 2004 a canadian regulatory agency health canada issued a draft report concluding that exposures to pfos do not pose a risk to human health in that country another canadian agency environment canada issued a separate draft report at the same time proposing to regulate pfos on the ground that it could be harmful to the environment the company has submitted comments on each draft report 

  

  

regulatory evaluation activities continue in the european union including some of its member countries other countries and certain international bodies as to pfoa andor pfos these activities include gathering of exposure and use information preliminary risk assessment and examination of regulatory approaches 

  

the company in cooperation with local and state agencies tested groundwater beneath two former waste disposal sites in washington county minnesota used many years ago by the company to dispose of waste containing perfluorooctanyl compounds the test results show that water from municipal wells near the former disposal sites contain low levels of perfluorooctanyl compounds pfos and pfoa that the minnesota department of health does not currently consider to pose a health risk additional testing will be conducted and the company expects to assist the government authorities in addressing such circumstances as appropriate 

  

the company has completed the selfaudit it agreed with the epa in june 1999 to undertake concerning its compliance with the toxic substances control act tsca that included the tsca section 8e reporting requirement as applied to studies on perfluorooctanyl chemistry and other products based on communications with epa the company understands that epa is presently evaluating the results of this selfaudit pursuant to the agreement which provides for stipulated monetary penalties 

  

the company markets its newly reformulated scotchgard™ products which replace previous versions pursuant to a consent agreement with the epa that requires extensive health and environmental effects testing of the base chemistry underlying such products most of which has been completed the epa has not yet issued the anticipated hazard assessment of that health and environmental effects testing for the reformulated scotchgard™ products 

  

the company cannot predict what regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities if any may be taken regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions 

  

litigation  a purported class action lawsuit involving perfluorooctanyl chemistry that originally was filed in 2002 against the company by a former employee in the circuit court of morgan county alabama remains pending the lawsuit seeks unstated compensatory and punitive damages and alleges that the plaintiffs suffered fear increased risk and sub clinical injuries from exposure to perfluorooctanyl chemistry at or near the company’s decatur alabama manufacturing facility the complaint also alleges that the company acted improperly with respect to disclosures to workers concerning such chemistry the company is awaiting a decision from the court on the company’s motion to dismiss the complaint that was heard on december 10 2003 the company’s separate motion to dismiss the class action allegations is also pending on september 10 2004 three residents of morgan county alabama filed a purported class action lawsuit involving perfluorooctanyl chemistry in the circuit court of morgan county the lawsuit seeks unstated compensatory and punitive damages and alleges that the plaintiffs suffered damage to their property from emissions of perfluorooctanyl compounds from the company’s decatur alabama manufacturing facility that formerly produced those compounds the purported class appears to be included in the putative class action described above on february 3 2005 the judge granted the company’s motion to abate the case effectively putting the case on hold pending the outcome of the class certification decision in the action described above filed in the same court in 2002

  

on october 8 2004 two residents of washington county minnesota filed a purported class action in the district court of washington county on behalf of washington county residents whose property has allegedly been harmed by perfluorooctanyl compounds and who have allegedly suffered personal injury from such compounds from the company’s cottage grove minnesota manufacturing facility that formerly produced those compounds and other of its facilities nearby the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages in excess of 50000 per plaintiff and class member 

  

several hundred plaintiffs who claim to have lived in the vicinity of the acme barrel company’s storage drum reconditioning facility in chicago illinois filed a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2003 in the circuit court of cook county illinois against 3m and a number of other companies that allegedly were customers of acme barrel the complaint seeks unspecified damages for personal injuries and death allegedly caused by the plaintiffs’ exposure to chemicals migrating from acme barrel’s drum reconditioning operations the plaintiffs also assert that a class should be certified on behalf of all persons similarly situated a separate wrongful death lawsuit was filed in the circuit court of cook county illinois against 3m and a number of other companies on behalf of the estate and family of a person who worked at the cook county juvenile detention center in the vicinity of the acme barrel facility the lawsuit alleges unspecified damages from personal injuries and death allegedly caused by exposure to chemicals migrating from acme barrel’s drum reconditioning operations 

  

  

accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings 

the company complies with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” and related guidance and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is probable where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range the company records the most likely estimate of the loss or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate the company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established reserves if estimable or states that such an estimate cannot be made for those insured matters where the company has taken a reserve the company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the company’s insurance program for those insured matters where the company has not taken a reserve because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable or both but where the company has incurred an expense in defending itself the company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred the company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable or both if the company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 

  

because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded the company currently believes that such future charges if any would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company taking into account the significant available insurance coverage for products liability claims based on experience and developments the company periodically reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable andor not probable where appropriate the company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the company could change in the future 

  

the company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies including their exclusions pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies its experience with similar claims and assessment of the nature of the claim and records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered 

  

the following table shows the major categories of claims for which the company has been able to estimate its probable liability and for which the company has taken reserves and the related insurance receivables 

  

   

for those significant pending legal proceedings that do not appear in the table the company has determined that liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable or both and the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss at this time the amounts in the preceding table with respect to breast implant and environmental remediation represent the company’s best estimate of the respective liabilities 

  

breast implant insurance receivables as of december 31 2004 the company had receivables for insurance recoveries related to the breast implant matter of 278 million representing amounts covered by the minnesota supreme court’s ruling of august 2003 against the insurers but yet to be received approximately 215 million and other amounts that have been claimed from various reinsurers the minnesota insurance guaranty association and the estates of certain insolvent insurance carriers the company received about 50 million in 2004 offsetting a portion of the previously recorded receivable pursuant to settlements with six insurers and one reinsurer that were consistent with the company’s overall expectation of recovery as a result of the minnesota

  

  

supreme court ruling various factors could affect the timing and amount of proceeds to be received under the balance of the company’s various insurance policies including i additional delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers ii the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future and iii the outcome of the pending legal proceedings involving the insurers including the insurers’ pending motion for partial relief from the amount the company believes is due under the minnesota supreme court decision 

  

respirator maskasbestos liabilities and insurance receivables the company estimates its respirator maskasbestos liabilities both the cost to resolve the claim and defense costs by examining i the company’s experience in resolving claims ii apparent trends iii the apparent quality of newlyfiled claims eg the company believes many of the recently filed claims have been asserted on behalf of asymptomatic claimants iv changes in the nature and mix of claims eg the proportion of claims asserting usage of the company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos silica or other occupational dusts and claims pleading use of asbestoscontaining products allegedly manufactured by the company v the number of current claims and an assumption for projection of the number of future asbestos and other claims that may be filed against the company vi the cost to resolve recently settled claims and vii an estimate of the cost to resolve and defend against current and future claims because of the inherent difficulty in projecting claims that have not yet been asserted particularly with respect to the company’s respiratory products that themselves did not contain any harmful materials which makes the various published studies that purport to project future asbestos claims substantially removed from the company’s principal experience and which themselves vary widely the company does not believe that there is any single best estimate of this liability nor that it can reliably estimate the amount or range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the reserve the company has established

  

developments may occur that could affect the company’s estimate of its liabilities and associated expenses these developments include but are not limited to significant changes in i the number of future claims ii the average cost of resolving claims iii the legal costs of defending these claims and in maintaining trial readiness iv changes in the mix and nature of claims received v trial and appellate outcomes vi changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims and vii the financial viability of other codefendants and insurers congress is currently considering legislation that would terminate essentially all litigation related to asbestos but not other occupational dusts in exchange for substantial annual payments by the defendant companies and their insurers and accordingly such legislation if enacted would bring considerable certainty to the assessment of the company’s future asbestosrelated liability the company supports such legislation in principle although enactment of the proposed legislation could cause the company to record substantial additional liabilities 

  

as a result of the caseload and the costs of aggressively defending itself the company made payments of 81 million in 2004 and increased its reserves in the fourth quarter of 2004 for the respirator maskasbestos liabilities by 40 million to 248 million no liability had been previously recorded regarding the nowreversed mississippi jury verdict and no liability has been recorded regarding the pending action brought by the west virginia attorney general previously described 

  

as of december 31 2004 the company had receivables for insurance recoveries related to the respirator maskasbestos litigation of 464 million the company increased its receivables in the fourth quarter of 2004 for insurance recoveries related to respirator maskasbestos litigation by 20 million and received payments from insurers and one reinsurer of 4 million in the third quarter of 2004 while the company has substantial remaining claimsmade and occurrence pre1986 insurance coverage as previously noted this additional receivable represents a lower percentage of the additional liability than was the case with receivables recorded prior to 2004 primarily because of varying degrees of prior settlements at higher levels of the company’s insurance coverage insolvencies of certain insurers uncertainties concerning the precise manner of assigning particular costs to specific policies and the types of claims asserted various factors could affect the timing and amount of proceeds to be received under the company’s various insurance policies including i delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers ii the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future and iii the outcome of possible legal proceedings with respect to respirator maskasbestos liability insurance coverage 

  

the difference between the accrued liability and insurance receivable represents the time delay between payment of claims and receipt of insurance reimbursements because of the lag time between settlement and payment of a claim no meaningful conclusions may be drawn from quarterly changes in the amount of receivables for expected insurance recoveries and the quarterly changes in the number of claimants at the end of each quarter 

  

environmental remediation liabilities and insurance receivables as of december 31 2004 the company had recorded liabilities of 39 million for estimated environmental remediation costs based upon an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of 16 million the company records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are

  

  

probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation depending on the site are based primarily upon internal or thirdparty environmental studies and estimates as to the number participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions the company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change the company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites currently ranging up to 30 years amounts expensed for environmental remediation activities were not material at these locations nor have there been material changes in the recorded liabilities for environmental matters 

  

it is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternate cleanup methods developments may occur that could affect the company’s current assessment including but not limited to i changes in the information available regarding the environmental impact of the company’s operations and products ii changes in environmental regulations or enforcement policies including efforts to recover natural resource damages iii new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques iv success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties and v the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and thirdparty indemnitors

3m is a diversified global manufacturer technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products 3m manages its operations in seven operating business segments health care industrial display and graphics consumer and office safety security and protection services electro and communications and transportation 3m’s performance in 2004 was broadbased with strong performance and growth in display and graphics but 3m also had success in established businesses like industrial safety security and protection services and consumer and office all seven business segments contributed to sales growth in 2004 in 2004 3m reported record net sales of 20011 billion and record net income of 2990 billion or 375 per diluted share compared with net sales of 18232 billion and net income of 2403 billion or 302 per diluted share in 2003 the combination of a 98 increase in net sales including core volume sales growth of 62 which excludes the impact of businesses acquired in the last 12 months and declining operating expenses as a percent of sales resulted in a 229 operating income profit margin the following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended december 31 

  

   

sales growth in 2004 was strongest in the display and graphics segment driven by sales of display enhancement films used in flatpanel devices and the industrial segment led by broadbased sales across industrial businesses and geographies sales growth in the safety security and protection services segment was driven by continued demand for personal protection products along with strong demand for cleaning and protection products sales growth in the consumer and office segment was broadbased with the transportation segment led by both the automotive oem and repair markets the health care segment experienced tough yearonyear comparisons through the first three quarters of the year with improvement in the fourth quarter of 2004 for the electro and communications segment this was the first year of positive sales growth since 2000 refer to the performance by business segment section for a more detailed discussion of the results of the respective segments 

  

asia pacific localcurrency sales which excludes translation impacts increased 136 with the strongest growth in china korea and taiwan all seven business segments contributed to this increase us sales revenue increased 39 with growth led by consumer and office safety security and protection services and the industrial businesses european localcurrency sales increased 08 with growth in safety security and protection services transportation industrial and health care in the combined latin america africa and canada area six of seven businesses had localcurrency sales increases led by electro and communications transportation industrial and health care foreign currency translation positively impacted european sales by 89 asia pacific sales by 56 and the combined latin america africa and canada area by 24 as the us dollar weakened against these currencies refer to the performance by geographic area section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective areas 

  

operating income in 2004 increased by 233 versus 2003 as all seven business segments posted increases the combination of solid sales growth and positive benefits from 3m’s 2004 corporate initiatives drove the operating income increase cost reduction projects related to these initiatives – six sigma global sourcing effectiveness 3m acceleration and eproductivity – contributed over 400 million in aggregate operating income benefits in 2004 see “note a” at the end of this overview section currency impacts related primarily to the weaker us dollar boosted 2004 operating income by an estimated 286 million partially offset by increased 

  

  

pension expense of 157 million operating income in 2003 was negatively impacted by a 93 million pretax charge related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against 3m in 1997 by lepage’s inc 

  

3m generated 4282 billion of operating cash flows in 2004 a 509 million increase over 2003 and ended the year with 2757 billion of cash and cash equivalents cash flow in 2004 was primarily driven by higher net income in 2004 the company utilized 2916 billion of cash to repurchase 3m common stock and pay dividends and contributed 591 million to its pension plans 3m’s debt to total capital ratio total capital defined as debt plus equity as of december 31 2004 was approximately 21 3m has an aa credit rating from standard  poor’s and an aa1 credit rating from moody’s investors service 

  

in 2005 3m expects to continue its momentum to drive sales operational efficiency and cash flow growth 3m is looking for continued broadbased product sales to drive its growth in addition to expected continued growth in optical film products and will also continue to assess potential acquisitions continued core volume sales growth will require both faster growth of existing productsservices and successful introduction of new products while international sales now represent 61 of worldwide sales the company will also focus on execution of sales and growth opportunities in the united states in part to energize the 3m acceleration initiative early in 2004 the company launched an extensive effort to reconnect and reengage with customers this will aid 3m in its continuing quest to provide additional customer value with both the customer and 3m benefiting through value creation and also facilitating 3m’s ability to achieve appropriate pricing the company also is focused on its corporate initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs cost reduction projects related to these initiatives are expected to contribute an additional 400 million to operating income in 2005 the company has experienced both price increases and supply limitations affecting several oilderived raw materials but to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of such materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact results although the company minimizes this effect through hedging about half of this impact 3m will also continue as it has for many years to incur expenses insured and uninsured in managing its litigation and environmental contingencies these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected refer to the forwardlooking statements discussion later in item 7 for discussion of these risks and uncertainties 

  

note a the company’s five corporate initiatives six sigma global sourcing effectiveness 3m acceleration eproductivity and global business processes are aimed at accelerating longterm topline growth improving cash flow and lowering its total cost structure indirect cost control which focused on reducing costs not directly associated with products or services is no longer a formal initiative and is now managed using a productivity metric six sigma focuses on higher growth productivity and cash flow global sourcing effectiveness generates savings by leveraging purchasing economies of scale encouraging competition among suppliers geographic broadening and eapplications through its 3m acceleration initiative the company is driving toward more and better new product ideas and faster more impactful new product introductions along with reallocating research and development resources to larger more global projects in eproductivity 3m believes it has a significant opportunity to improve productivity for its customers suppliers and for 3m itself 3m’s global business processes initiative continues 3m’s ongoing effort to standardize simplify and strengthen its business processes in order to increase the speed efficiency and quality of service functions vital to its business operations worldwide there can be no assurance that all of the estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized numerous factors may create offsets to these savings such as the potential for weakness in sales volumes normal increases in compensation and benefits and other inflationary pressures the company estimates that cost reduction projects related to initiatives provided a combined incremental benefit to operating income of more than 400 million in 2004 after contributing a similar amount in 2003 these initiatives provided an incremental benefit to operating income of more than 500 million in 2002

operating expenses 

  

   

cost of sales 

cost of sales includes manufacturing engineering and freight costs cost of sales decreased 11 percentage points in both 2004 and 2003 the 2004 decrease as a percent of net sales was driven by a combination of higher volumes productivity gains ongoing benefits of corporate initiatives and positive currency impacts including hedging impacts while 3m raw material costs increased during the year 3m’s global sourcing initiative was important in enabling 3m to minimize raw material cost increases during a period of commodity price inflation 

  

cost of sales in 2003 benefited from six sigma and other projects aimed at improving manufacturing throughput yield and productivity 3m’s global sourcing initiative has helped mitigate the impact of raw material price increases in 2003 raw material costs were essentially flat versus 2002 charges related to the 20012002 corporate restructuring program negatively impacted cost of sales by 07 percentage points in 2002 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses have improved by 06 percentage points in each of the past two years the improvement in 2004 as a percent of net sales was helped by leverage related to 3m’s strong growth in the asia pacific area sga expenses in us dollars increased in 2004 negatively impacted by currency translation and increased advertising and merchandising spending to support 3m’s strong brand portfolio on an ongoing basis the company is shifting sga dollars toward fastergrowth businesses and geographic areas 

  

sga expenses in us dollars in 2003 increased due to currency translation as well as higher advertising and merchandising spending charges related to the 20012002 corporate restructuring program negatively impacted sga in 2002 by 77 million or 05 of sales excluding these charges sga for 2003 was relatively flat as a percent of sales compared with 2002 

  

other expense 

in 2003 3m recorded pretax charges of 93 million 58 million aftertax or 7 cents per diluted share related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against 3m in 1997 by lepage’s inc the pretax charge of 93 million is classified as “other expense” within operating income for more detail refer to the discussion of “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this document

interest expense and income 

  

   

interest expense  the decrease in 2004 interest expense was primarily the result of lower average debt balances partially offset by higher interest rates in the united states the slight increase in 2003 interest expense was primarily due to a reduced benefit from capitalized interest related to lower capital spending and higher average debt balances largely offset by lower interest rates

interest income interest income increased in 2004 due to substantially higher cash balances in 2003 while average cash balances were higher than in 2002 interest income decreased due to lower interest rates

  

provision for income taxes 

  

   

the tax rate of 330 for 2004 was comparable to the 2003 rate of 329 income taxes associated with repatriating certain cash from outside the united states negatively impacted the 2004 and 2003 income tax rates refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the american jobs creation act of 2004 and the possible impact on the 2005 tax rate 

  

minority interest 

  

   

minority interest represents the elimination of the non3m ownership interests primarily in sumitomo 3m limited and 3m interunitek gmbh in 2002 only the increase in 2004 related primarily to higher net income in sumitomo 3m as 3m eliminates the non3m ownership portion of net income the decrease in 2003 related to 3m’s purchase of the minority interest shares of 3m interunitek gmbh in december 2002 and the purchase of an additional 25 ownership in sumitomo 3m in early 2003 refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these acquisitions

3m has various companysponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service compensation and age at retirement or termination see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension liability and expense 

  

  

as previously disclosed in the company’s june 30 2004 and september 30 2004 form 10qs in 2004 the company’s us plan measurement date was changed from september 30 to december 31 the primary reasons for this change include consistency between the us and international dates the increased clarity that results from having the same measurement and balance sheet dates and administrative simplification this change did not have a material impact on the determination of periodic pension cost or pension obligations 

  

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 87 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on projected results for similar allocations among asset classes the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and under certain circumstances amortized over future years of service therefore the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense for the us pension plan the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 900 for 2004 refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information on how this rate is determined the company is lowering the 2005 expected return on plan assets by 025 percentage points to 875 

  

the discount rate used to measure pension plan liabilities reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled as of december 31 2004 in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on fixedincome investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies by applying this methodology the company determined a discount rate of 575 to be appropriate as of december 31 2004 which is a reduction of 025 percentage points from the rate used as of september 30 2003 

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 the change in the minimum pension liability within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity by 1193 billion aftertax this increase was primarily the result of the assets being above the accumulated benefit obligation for the us qualified plan which caused the minimum pension liability recorded for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 to be reversed as a result the company’s us qualified plan recorded a prepaid pension asset of 1851 billion 

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 the company recognized total consolidated pretax pension expense after settlements curtailments and special termination benefits of 325 million up from 168 million in 2003 pension expense before settlements curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to increase to approximately 342 million in 2005 as previously mentioned the company lowered the expected return on assets assumption from 900 in 2004 to 875 in 2005 for the us pension plans holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by 025 percentage points would decreaseincrease us pension expense by approximately 19 million in 2005 for the us pension plans holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 025 percentage points would decreaseincrease us pension expense by approximately 30 million in 2005 

  

potential asset impairment issues 

3m net property plant and equipment totaled approximately 57 billion at december 31 2004 management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit in addition 3m goodwill totaled approximately 27 billion at december 31 2004 which based on impairment testing is not impaired a portion of this goodwill approximately 300 million is in 3m’s telecommunications business which competes in a very uncertain industry while the company believes this business will maintain its value events such as a significant adverse change in the business climate could create future impairment losses 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 which requires recognition of an expense when goods or services are provided sfas no 123r requires the determination of the fair value of the sharebased compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the sharebased compensation vests the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 123r effective july 1 2005 additional information regarding this and other accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

financial condition and liquidity 

the company generates significant ongoing cash flow as evidenced by the reduction in net debt during 2004 as follows 

  

   

3m believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected investments and capital expenditures the company has an aa credit rating from standard  poor’s and an aa1 credit rating from moody’s investors service the company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the company’s stock 

  

the company’s financial condition and liquidity at december 31 2004 remained strong various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from monthtomonth depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled 2649 billion at december 31 2004 compared with 2638 billion at december 31 2003 this slight increase was primarily related to an increase in cash 921 million offset by an increase in debt classified as shortterm borrowings and current portion of longterm debt 892 million the cash balance benefited from higher net income and working capital improvements in accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable 

  

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities ie accounts receivable inventory accounts payable these measures may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the accounts receivable turnover index defined as quarterly net sales – fourth quarter at yearend – multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable totaled 729 at december 31 2004 an improvement from 695 at december 31 2003 receivables increased 78 million compared with december 31 2003 with currency translation of 120 million due to the weaker us dollar driving this increase the inventory turnover index defined as quarterly factory cost – fourth quarter at yearend – multiplied by four divided by ending inventory was 529 at december 31 2004 an improvement from 512 at december 31 2003 inventories increased 81 million compared with december 31 2003 with currency translation of 80 million accounting for almost all of this increase another working capital measure used by the company also reflects the impact of accounts payable this combined index defined as quarterly net sales – fourth quarter at yearend – multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable was 578 at december 31 2004 an improvement from 548 at december 31 2003 accounts payable increased 81 million compared to december 31 2003 

  

cash flows from operating activities 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows in both 2004 and 2003 cash flow improvements were primarily driven by higher net income tax timing differences and certain working capital improvements ie accounts receivables inventories accounts payable in all periods presented significant 

  

  

company pension contributions negatively impacted cash flows in all years with larger amounts in 2003 and 2002 a portion of the tax timing benefit relates to the tax benefit received from company pension contributions in 2003 3m made 46 million of payments under the corporate restructuring plan compared with 306 million in 2002 

  

in the quarter ended september 30 2004 the company made a special pension contribution to 3m’s japanese pension plan of 155 million and a discretionary contribution of 300 million to its us qualified pension plan in the third quarter of 2003 3m made a discretionary contribution of 600 million to its us qualified pension plan compared with a discretionary contribution of 789 million in the third quarter of 2002 future contributions will depend on market conditions interest rates and other factors 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities 

  

the following table recaps for breast implant and respirator masksasbestos litigation the liabilities and associated insurance receivables cash received from insurance cash fees and payments made and the pretax expense for 2004 and 2003 because of the time delay between payment of claims and receipt of insurance reimbursements the december 31 2004 amounts for both breast implant and respirator maskasbestos liabilities are less than expected insurance recoveries thus the expected net inflow of cash will increase future cash flows the company recorded the lepage’s verdict liability of 93 million pretax in the first quarter of 2003 for a more detailed discussion of these and other legal proceedings refer to part i item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k

cash flows from financing activities 

  

   

total debt at december 31 2004 was 2821 billion down from 2937 billion at yearend 2003 due to the strong cash flow generated during 2004 in 2004 the cash flow increase in net shortterm debt of 399 million includes the portion of shortterm debt with original maturities of 90 days or less the repayment of debt of 868 million primarily related to commercial paper retirements of approximately 475 million and the retirements of 350 million in mediumterm notes proceeds from debt of 358 million primarily related to commercial paper issuances total debt was 21 of total capital total capital is defined as debt plus equity compared with 27 at yearend 2003 

  

debt securities including the company’s shelf registration its mediumterm notes program dealer remarketable securities and convertible note are all discussed in more detail in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 3m has a shelf registration and mediumterm notes program through which 15 billion of mediumterm notes may be offered in 2004 the company issued approximately 62 million in debt securities under its mediumterm notes program the mediumterm notes program and shelf registration have remaining capacity of approximately 1438 billion the company’s 350 million of dealer remarketable securities classified as current portion of longterm debt were remarketed for one year in december 2004 in addition the company has a convertible note with a book value of 556 million at december 31 2004 at december 31 2004 the dealer remarketable securities convertible note and 62 million of mediumterm notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments however the company 

  

  

does not anticipate redemption of these securities in 2005 for a discussion of accounting pronouncements that will affect accounting treatment for the convertible note refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of eitf issue no 0408 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” and proposed sfas no 128r “earnings per share” 

  

repurchases of common stock are made to support the company’s stockbased employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes on november 10 2003 the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 15 billion of the company’s common stock between january 1 2004 and december 31 2004 in november 2004 3m’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 200 million of the company’s common stock in 2004 and also authorized the repurchase of up to 20 billion of the company’s common stock between january 1 2005 and january 31 2006 refer to the table captioned “issuer purchases of equity securities” in part ii item 5 for more information

other cash flows from financing activities include distributions to minority interests changes in cash overdraft balances and principal payments for capital leases 

  

liquidity 

the company’s liquidity remains strong primary shortterm liquidity needs are provided through us commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances as of december 31 2004 outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled 671 million and averaged approximately 387 million during 2004 mediumterm note shelf borrowing capacity totaled 1438 billion as of december 31 2004 credit support for outstanding commercial paper is provided by a 565 million 364day credit agreement among a group of primary relationship banks this facility provides up to 115 million in letters of credit 86 million of which was utilized at december 31 2004 in 2005 it is anticipated that the 364day credit agreement will be replaced by a fiveyear agreement with terms substantially the same as that of the current agreement committed credit facilities of 53 million are in place across several international subsidiary locations the company also has uncommitted lines of credit outside the united states totaling 637 million 

  

the company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted cash and cash equivalents and certain other current assets could provide additional liquidity to meet near term obligations if necessary at yearend 2004 certain debt agreements 350 million of dealer remarketable securities and 202 million of esop debt had ratings triggers bbbbaa3 or lower that would require repayment of debt the company currently has aaaa1 debt ratings in addition the 565 million 364day credit agreement requires 3m to maintain a capitalization ratio at no more than 060 to 1 at the end of each quarter this ratio is calculated as funded debt including all borrowed money and letters of credit utilized to the sum of funded debt and equity at december 31 2004 this ratio was approximately 022 to 1 

  

3m’s cash balance at december 31 2004 totaled 2757 billion 3m’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth including continual review of acquisition opportunities 3m paid dividends of more than 11 billion in 2004 and has a long history of dividend increases 3m’s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 20 billion of the company’s common stock between january 1 2005 and january 31 2006 the company may also make additional contributions to its pension plan in the future but exact amounts are uncertain and will depend on market conditions 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2004 the company had not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements 3m’s accrued product warranty liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of current and longterm liabilities are estimated at approximately 22 million 3m does not consider this amount to be material the fair value of 3m guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material 

  

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require 3m to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe 

  

third party patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 follows 

  

contractual obligations 

  

   

longterm debt payments due in 2005 include 350 million of dealer remarketable securities final maturity 2010 62 million of mediumterm notes final maturity 2044 and 556 million of convertible notes final maturity 2032 these securities are classified as current portion of longterm debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments 

  

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these numbers will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis 

  

as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2005 thus company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2005 and future years contractual capital commitments are also included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2005 and beyond for 2005 the company expects to spend approximately 950 million on purchases of property plant and equipment 

  

financial instruments 

the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure interest rate risks and commodity price risks a financial risk management committee composed of senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities this committee determines the company’s financial risk policies and objectives and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation risk analysis counterparty credit approval and ongoing monitoring and reporting 

  

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection swaps and forward physical contracts 

  

  

a variancecovariance statistical modeling technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss in aftertax earnings of financial instruments derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2004 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 confidence level over a 12month time horizon based on this analysis of the company’s interest rate risks possible changes in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on aftertax earnings 5 million at december 31 2004 and 6 million at december 31 2003 based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks possible changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact aftertax earnings by 61 million 67 million at december 31 2003 when including certain commodity risks possible changes in commodity rates could adversely impact aftertax earnings by an additional 10 million an additional 3 million at december 31 2003 the model used analyzed over 20 different currencies and five commodities but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results 

  

the company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales and because approximately 60 of sales are outside the united states this would increase production outside the united states this will also help mitigate the effects from currency fluctuations in 2001 the company increased the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen yearoveryear impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings however this hedging program will not make 3m immune to currency impacts 

  

the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 44 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a 10 price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 30 million per year derivative instruments are used to hedge less than one percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 of this energy exposure 

  

forwardlooking statements 

this annual report on form 10k including “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements may be identified by the use of words like “plan” “expect” “aim” “believe” “project” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “will” “should” “could” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion expectation or projection of future operating or financial performance events or trends in particular these include statements about the company’s strategy for growth product development market position future performance or results of current or anticipated products interest rates foreign exchange rates and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings 

  

factors that could affect future results – forwardlooking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those projected in any such forwardlooking statements depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

  

• results and trends are impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic conditions  the company operates in more than 60 countries and derives approximately 60 of its revenues from outside the united states the company’s business may be affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region social political or labor conditions in a specific country or region or potential adverse foreign tax consequences

  

• foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and net earnings and its results of operations because the company derives approximately 60 of its revenues from outside the united states its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and net earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies

  

• the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection gain market acceptance of new products or successfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals for example new 3m pharmaceutical products like any pharmaceutical under development face substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of development and regulatory review there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful

  

  

• the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components and materials including oilderived compounds due to market demand currency exchange risks material shortages and other factors  the company depends on various components and materials supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products and it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted or terminated in the future any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations due to market demand currency risks or material shortages or that future price fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the company

  

• there is the possibility that acquisitions and strategic alliances may not meet sales andor profit expectations  as part of the company’s strategy for growth the company has made and may continue to make acquisitions and enter into strategic alliances however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to quickly integrate the acquired business and obtain the anticipated synergies or that acquisitions and strategic alliances will be beneficial to the company

  

• the company’s future results may be affected if the company generates less operating income from its corporate initiatives than estimated  3m’s corporate initiatives include six sigma global sourcing effectiveness 3m acceleration eproductivity and global business processes cost reduction projects related to these initiatives are expected to contribute an additional 400 million to operating income in 2005 there can be no assurance that all of the estimated operating income improvements from the initiatives will be realized

  

• the company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving product liability antitrust environmental or other matters the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment significant settlement or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period a specific factor that may influence the company’s estimate of its future asbestosrelated liabilities is the pending congressional consideration of legislation to reform asbestosrelated litigation and pertinent information derived from that process for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and associated accounting estimates see the discussion of “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this document

research patents and raw materials

research and product development constitute an important part of 3m’s activities products resulting from research and development have been a major driver of 3m’s growth research development and related expenses totaled 1102 billion in 2003 1070 billion in 2002 and 1084 billion in 2001 research and development covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances to the development of new and improved products and their uses totaled 749 million in 2003 738 million in 2002 and 745 million in 2001 related expenses primarily include technical support provided to customers for existing products by 3m laboratories

consistent with 3m’s corporate reorganization 3m also realigned its research and development efforts in 2003 this realignment was designed to develop technologies needed for the future to more closely align technical resources with business priorities and to shorten the distance between research and development and 3m’s customers 3m established a single global corporate research laboratory which brings together more than 

600 researchers focused on technology building while also freeing approximately 400 other 3m technical people to directly support the growth of 3m business units

the company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks which are important to the company the company also owns or holds licenses to use numerous us and foreign patents the company’s research and development activities continuously generate new patents patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country

the company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses in general no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the company as a whole or to any of the company’s business segments the importance of patents in the health care and display and graphics segments is described in “performance by business segment — health care business” and “display and graphics business” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k

the company experienced no significant problems in the purchase of raw materials during 2003 although the company experienced upward pressure on certain raw material pricing in 2003 which it expects to continue in 2004 it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have

environmental law compliance

3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by foreign national state and local environmental laws 3m has made and plans to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites refer to part i item 3 legal proceedings

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives

in 2003 3m expended about 34 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment the comparable amount in 2002 was about 21 million these amounts exclude expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements scrubbers containment structures solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business consistent with the company’s policies stressing environmental responsibility average annual capital expenditures other than for remediation projects are presently expected to be about 43 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions

while we cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

antitrust litigation

lepage’s inc a transparent tape competitor of 3m filed a lawsuit against the company in june 1997 in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging that certain marketing practices of the company constituted unlawful monopolization under the antitrust laws lepage’s obtained a jury verdict of 228 million against the company in 1999 automatically trebled under the law in the first quarter of 2003 the united states court of appeals for the third circuit en banc affirmed the verdict and the company 

recorded pretax charges of 93 million 58 million after tax to reflect this judgment with interest through march 31 2003 and lepage’s estimate of its attorneys’ fees 3m petitioned the united states supreme court to review the third circuit’s ruling

the supreme court on october 6 2003 invited the solicitor general to express the views of the united states on the company’s pending request that the supreme court agree to hear its appeal from the third circuit’s ruling of march 26 2003 affirming the trial verdict the supreme court is not expected to act on the company’s petition to review the third circuit’s ruling until after the government files its brief with the court notably on january 13 2004 the supreme court unanimously dismissed a monopolization claim in verizon communications inc v law offices of curtis v trinko llp the company’s petition to review the third circuit’s ruling filed in june 2003 alternatively asked the supreme court to consider vacating the lepages’ ruling and remanding it for further proceedings to the court of appeals if the supreme court rejected the monopoly claim in verizon on grounds applicable to the lepage’s decision

following the lepage’s verdict and appellate ruling certain direct and indirect tape purchasers filed seven purported class actions against the company in various state and federal courts in california florida tennessee new jersey and pennsylvania of the seven two cases have been dismissed one on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and the other on a motion for summary judgment the summary judgment award is now on appeal and the plaintiff in the dismissed complaint has filed an amended complaint of the remaining five cases two have the company’s motions to dismiss pending one has been stayed pending the outcome of the supreme court proceedings in lepage’s  one has the company’s motion to coordinate with the stayed case pending and one pending in the federal court in philadelphia is in active discovery proceedings the court having denied the company’s dismissal motion the plaintiff’s motion for class certificati on which the company has opposed is currently under consideration by that court

breast implant insurance recovery and related litigation

the company and certain other companies were named as defendants in a number of claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from breast implants formerly manufactured by the company or a related company the vast majority of claims against the company have been resolved the company does not consider its remaining probable liability to be material

the minnesota supreme court ruled primarily in favor of 3m in litigation with its insurers over insurance coverage for breast implant claims on august 21 2003 the court’s ruling confirms insurance coverage owed to 3m by 29 insurers remaining in the case and holds that these insurers are liable up to the limits of their respective policies the minnesota supreme court denied the insurers’ petition for rehearing on september 29 2003 3m expects to collect approximately 250 million from these insurers as a result of this decision this event will not affect 3m’s earnings as the amount received will offset a portion of a previously recorded insurance receivable subsequent proceedings to effectuate the ruling are in progress as part of these proceedings the insurers filed in february 2004 motions for partial relief from paying portions of the amounts due under the minnesota supreme court decision the company believes it unlikely that such relief will be granted

a hearing was conducted in september 2003 in the arbitration proceeding in london england brought by the company to recover insurance coverage for some of its breast implant liability and costs from certain claimsmade insurance carriers the company expects a decision on whether coverage exists from the arbitration panel in the first half of 2004 if the panel decides the coverage question in the company’s favor it will then determine the amount if any of coverage in a subsequent proceeding expected to occur in the fall of 2004

on september 15 2003 a threejudge panel of the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reversed in part the dismissal of a lawsuit by the united states against the company and other defendants seeking reimbursement of the cost of medical treatment under medicare provided to certain women with breast implants from the company and other breast implant manufacturers and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings on december 23 2003 the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit denied the petition for rehearing filed by the defendants and the matter will return to the united states district court for pretrial discovery and other proceedings because relatively few breast implant claimants were eligible for medicare payments the company does not expect any judgment or settlement to be material

respirator maskasbestos litigation

for more than 20 years the company has defended and resolved the claims of over 300000 individual claimants alleging injuries from occupational dust exposures as of december 31 2003 the company is a named defendant with multiple codefendants in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 88700 individual claimants an increase from the 45000 individual claimants with actions pending at december 31 2002 the company experienced in the first half of 2003 an increase in the number of claims and an increase in the proportion of silicarelated claims in contrast to asbestosrelated claims which nonetheless continue to represent the large majority of the total claims the total number of new claimants filing claims against the company during the second half of 2003 declined somewhat from the first half but the proportion of silicarelated claims relative to total claims continued at a rate that is higher than the company’s histo rical experience the company believes that much of the increased number of claims filed in 2003 is due to claimants filing claims before recent and anticipated tort reform legislation affecting asbestosrelated actions might become effective and that many of these newer claims have been asserted on behalf of asymptomatic claimants

the vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the company allege use of some of the company’s mask and respirator products and seek damages from the company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos silica or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace the remaining claimants generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the company which are often unspecified and by other defendants or occasionally at company premises

in many of these lawsuits and claims the company is named as a defendant with multiple codefendants where no product the company manufactured is involved or where the company is ultimately determined not to have manufactured the products identified by the plaintiffs the company’s vigorous defense of this litigation has resulted in i dismissals of many lawsuits without any payment by the company ii an average settlement value of less than 1000 per claimant for all of the claims and lawsuits that the company has resolved including those dismissed without payment and iii jury verdicts for the company in four of the five cases tried to verdict

of the five cases the company has taken to trial two were tried in 2003 and both resulted in the juries exonerating the company of any liability one jury verdict involving a single plaintiff was returned on october 24 2003 in orange county texas and the other involving two plaintiffs was returned on december 10 2003 in jefferson county texas all three plaintiffs had sought to recover damages from the company arising from their alleged silicosis which they claimed to have contracted from occupational exposure to silica despite their purported use of the company’s respirator mask equipment at various times

the single jury verdict adverse to the company was returned in holmes county mississippi in 2001 the plaintiffs in that case claimed that a 3m respirator and mask did not protect them against contracting certain asbestosrelated diseases allegedly caused by exposure to asbestoscontaining products manufactured by other defendants based on the jury’s findings of percentage of fault attributable to each defendant the company’s share of the verdict was 225 million the verdict is the subject of an appeal now pending in that state’s supreme court

plaintiffs have asserted specific dollar claims for damages in approximately 60 of the 9315 lawsuits that were pending against the company at the end of 2003 in all jurisdictions a majority of states restrict or prohibit specifying damages in tort cases such as these and most of the remaining jurisdictions do not require such specification in those cases in which plaintiffs choose to assert specific dollar amounts in their complaints brought in states that permit such pleading the amounts claimed are typically not meaningful as an indicator of the company’s potential liability this is because a the amounts claimed typically bear no relation to the extent of the plaintiff’s injury if any b the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants with the typical complaint asserting claims against an average of 88 different defendants the damages alleged are not attributed to individual defendants and a defendant’s share of liability may tu rn on the law of joint and several liability which can vary by state and by the amount of fault a jury allocates to each defendant if a case is ultimately tried before a jury c many cases are filed against the company even though the plaintiffs did not use any of the company’s products and ultimately are withdrawn or dismissed without any payment and d many cases are brought on behalf of plaintiffs who have not suffered any medical injury and ultimately are resolved without any payment or a payment that is a small fraction of the 

damages initially claimed of the 5569 pending cases in which purported damage amounts are specified in the complaints 4344 cases involve claims of 100000 or less 143 cases involve claims between 100000 and 3 million 8 of these cases also allege punitive damages of 250000 1 of them also alleges punitive damages of 1 million 4 of them also allege punitive damages of 15 million and 57 of them also allege punitive damages of 25 million 69 cases involve claims of 75 million 1007 cases involve claims of 10 million 1 of these cases also alleges punitive damages of 350000 1 of them also alleges punitive damages of 3 million and 909 of them also allege an equal amount in punitive damages and 6 cases involve claims of 50 million all of which also allege punitive damages of 50 million some complaints allege that the compensatory and punitive damages are at least the amounts specified as previously stated the company has more than 20 yea rs of experience in defending litigations of this type has resolved the claims of over 300000 individuals with a cumulative average settlement amount of less than 1000 per claimant and based on this experience and for the other reasons cited believes that the damage amounts specified in complaints are not a meaningful factor in any assessment of the company’s potential liability

the state of west virginia through its attorney general filed a complaint in 2003 against the company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the circuit court of lincoln county west virginia the complaint seeks substantial but unspecified compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the state for worker’s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to more than 20000 current or former miners allegedly suffering from silicosis andor coal miner’s pneumoconiosis “black lung disease” the complaint also seeks unquantified punitive damages the company removed the case to federal court and the state of west virginia is seeking to remand the case to state court the company and the codefendants have filed a motion to dismiss the case the company believes the allegations have no merit and is vigorously defending this lawsuit

commercial matter

the company has notified corning incorporated that the company seeks compensation for breach of certain representations and warranties contained in the stock purchase agreement between 3m and corning incorporated for the acquisition of corning precision lens inc efforts to resolve the issues under the dispute resolution provisions of the stock purchase agreement are in progress with a current focus on the extent to which the portion of the purchase price held in escrow since the acquisition about 50 million should be released to corning and the extent of continuing future indemnity obligations of corning

environmental matters

the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations enforceable by foreign national state and local authorities and private parties in the united states and abroad including those pertaining to air emissions wastewater discharges toxic substances and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes these laws and regulations provide under certain circumstances a basis for the remediation of contamination as well as personal injury and property damage claims the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations defending personal injury and property damage claims and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities in its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations the company has established and periodically updates policies relating to environmental standards of pe rformance for its operations worldwide

remediation under certain environmental laws including the united states comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and similar state laws the company may be jointly and severally liable with other companies for the costs of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at offsite locations the company has identified numerous locations most of which are in the united states at which it may have some liability refer to the following section “accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings” for more information on this subject

regulatory activities the company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by the us environmental protection agency epa and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of perfluorooctanyl chemistry the previously disclosed epa consent order negotiating process to obtain additional information to enable the epa to further develop a human health risk assessment and identify routes of exposure concerning one perfluorooctanyl compound is in progress the epa is developing a draft risk assessment on that compound that will express the epa’s assessment in terms of the margin of exposure between the levels of that compound that it believes may cause possible adverse health effects in laboratory 

animals and the levels found in human blood sera in the worldwide population and subgroups the company expects that the epa’s science advisory board will review the draft risk assessment in 2004 as a result of its phaseout decision in may 2000 the company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl compounds except that a subsidiary produces limited quantities of one compound for its own industrial use and utilizes recycling technology that reduces the demand for new production of that compound on behalf of one customer and is offering to license it to others

the epa is also considering the addition of this perfluorooctanyl compound and possibly a second encompassed in the company’s phaseout decision to its integrated risk information system an epa database that reports the epa’s assessment of the possible human health effects that may result from exposure to certain compounds the centers for disease control and prevention recently identified several perfluorooctanyl compounds and other fluorinated substances certain of which have been or are produced by the company that it plans to include in a future national reports on human exposure to environmental chemicals

the company markets its newly reformulated scotchgard™ replacement products pursuant to a consent agreement with the epa that requires extensive health and environmental effects testing of the base chemistry underlying such products most of which has been completed the epa has indicated that it plans to prepare a hazard assessment of that health and environmental effects testing in 2004

the company cannot predict what regulatory action arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities if any may be taken regarding some or all of such compounds or the consequences of any such action

litigation the company continues to vigorously defend a purported class action lawsuit involving perfluorooctanyl chemistry that was originally filed in 2002 against the company by a former employee in the circuit court of morgan county alabama the lawsuit seeks unstated compensatory and punitive damages and alleges that the plaintiffs suffered fear increased risk and sub clinical injuries from exposure to perfluorooctanyl chemistry at or near the company’s decatur alabama manufacturing facility the complaint also alleges that the company acted improperly with respect to disclosures to workers concerning such chemistry the company is awaiting a decision from the court on the company’s motion to dismiss the complaint that was heard on december 10 2003 the company has pending its motion to dismiss the class action allegations

in the third quarter of 2003 several hundred plaintiffs who claim to have lived in the vicinity of the acme barrel company’s storage drum reconditioning facility in chicago filed a lawsuit in the circuit court of cook county illinois against 3m and a number of other companies that allegedly were customers of acme barrel the complaint seeks unspecified damages for personal injuries and death allegedly caused by the plaintiffs’ exposure to chemicals migrating from acme barrel’s drum reconditioning operations the plaintiffs also assert that a class should be certified on behalf of all persons similarly situated a separate wrongful death lawsuit was filed in the circuit court of cook county illinois against 3m and a number of other companies on behalf of the estate and family of a person who worked at the cook county juvenile detention center in the vicinity of the acme barrel facility the lawsuit alleges unspecified damages from personal injuries and death alleg edly caused by exposure to chemicals migrating from acme barrel’s drum reconditioning operations the company is vigorously defending these lawsuits

accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings

the company complies with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies”  and related guidance and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is probable where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range the company records the most likely estimate of the loss or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate the company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established reserves if estimable or states that such an estimate cannot be made for those insured matters where the company has taken a reserve the company also records receivables for the probable amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the company’s insurance program for those insured matters where the company has not taken a reserve because the liability is not probable or t he amount of the liability is not estimable or both but where the company has incurred an expense in defending itself the company records receivables for the probable amount of insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred the company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable or both if the company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred

because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded the company currently believes that such future charges if any would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company taking into account the significant available insurance coverage for products liability claims based on experience and developments in the litigation the company periodically reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable andor not probable wher e appropriate the company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the company could change in the future

the following table shows the major categories of claims for which the company has been able to estimate its probable liability and for which the company has taken reserves and the related insurance receivables if any

 

for those significant pending legal proceedings that do not appear in the table the company has determined that liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable or both and the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss at this time the amounts in the preceding table with respect to breast implant the lepage’s verdict and environmental remediation represent the company’s best estimate of the respective liabilities

breast implant insurance receivables — as of december 31 2003 the company had receivables for insurance recoveries related to the breast implant matter of 338 million representing amounts covered by the minnesota ruling against the insurers but yet to be received approximately 250 million amounts sought from insurance carriers in the london arbitration and other amounts that have been claimed from various reinsurers the minnesota insurance guaranty association and the estates of certain insolvent insurance carriers various factors could affect the timing and amount of proceeds to be received under the company’s various insurance policies including i additional delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers ii the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future and iii the outcome of the pending legal proceedings involving the insurers there can be no absolute assurance that the company will collect all amounts recorded as being probable of recovery fr om its insurers

respirator maskasbestos liabilities and insurance receivables — the company estimates its respirator maskasbestos liabilities both the cost to resolve the claim and defense costs by examining i the company’s experience in resolving claims ii apparent trends iii the apparent quality of newlyfiled claims eg the company believes many of the recently filed claims have been asserted on behalf of asymptomatic claimants iv changes in the nature and mix of claims eg the proportion of claims asserting usage of the company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos silica or other occupational dusts and claims pleading use of asbestoscontaining products allegedly manufactured by the company v the number of current claims and an assumption for projection of the number of future asbestos and other claims that may be filed against the company vi the cost to resolve recently settled claims and vii an estimate of the cost to resolve and defend against current and future claims because of the inherent difficulty in projecting claims that have not yet been asserted particularly with respect to the company’s respiratory products that themselves did not contain any harmful materials which makes the various published studies that purport to project future asbestos claims substantially removed from the company’s principal experience and which themselves vary widely the company does not believe that there is any single best estimate of this liability nor that it can reliably estimate the amount or range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the reserve the company has established

the company’s current estimate of its liabilities and associated expenses for respirator maskasbestos litigation is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time additional developments may occur that could affect the company’s estimate of its liabilities and associated expenses these developments include but are not limited to significant changes in i the number of future claims ii the average cost of resolving claims iii the legal costs of defending these claims and in maintaining trial readiness iv changes in the mix and nature of claims received v changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims vi the financial viability of other codefendants and insurers and vii other unknown variables the company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on the current estimate of its liabilities and associated expenses congress is currently considering legislation that would terminate essentially all litigation relate d to asbestos but not other occupational dusts in exchange for substantial annual payments by the defendant companies and their insurers and accordingly such legislation if enacted would bring considerable certainty to the assessment of the company’s future asbestosrelated liability the company supports such legislation in principle although the proposed legislation could cause the company to record substantial additional liabilities

as a result of the larger caseload and the costs of aggressively defending itself the company made payments of 103 million and increased its reserves in 2003 for the respirator maskasbestos liabilities by 231 million to 289 million at december 31 2003 no liability has been recorded for the one respirator mask adverse trial verdict now on appeal to the mississippi supreme court because the company believes that judgment will be overturned nor for the pending action brought by the west virginia attorney general previously described

as of december 31 2003 the company had receivables for insurance recoveries related to the respirator maskasbestos litigation of 448 million the company increased its receivables in 2003 for insurance recoveries related to respirator maskasbestos litigation by 205 million and received payments from insurers of 21 million while the company has substantial remaining claimsmade and occurrence pre1986 insurance coverage future estimates of additional insurance receivables are likely to represent a lower percentage than in the past of future estimates of additional liabilities if any due to lesser though still significant remaining coverage in the higher layers of the company’s occurrence pre1986 insurance coverage various factors could affect the timing and amount of proceeds to be received under the company’s various insurance policies including i delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers ii the extent to which insurers may become insolven t in the future and iii the outcome of the currently ongoing negotiations and possible future legal proceedings with respect to respirator maskasbestos liability insurance coverage there can be no absolute assurance that the company will collect all amounts recorded as being probable of recovery from its insurers

the difference between the accrued liability and insurance receivable represents the time delay between payment of claims and receipt of insurance reimbursements because of the lag time between settlement and payment of a claim no meaningful conclusions may be drawn from quarterly changes in the amount of receivables for expected insurance recoveries and the quarterly changes in the number of claimants at the end of each quarter

environmental remediation liabilities and insurance receivables — as of december 31 2003 the company had recorded liabilities of 41 million for estimated environmental remediation costs based upon an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of 16 million the company records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation are depending on the site based primarily upon internal or thirdparty environmental studies and estimates as to the number participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions the company adjusts recorded liabilities as further informat ion develops or circumstances change the company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites currently ranging up to 30 years amounts expensed for environmental remediation activities were not material at these locations nor have there been material changes in the recorded liabilities for environmental matters

it is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternate cleanup methods the company’s current assessment of the probable liabilities and associated expenses related to such environmental matters is based on the facts and circumstances known at this time developments may occur that could affect the company’s assessment including but not limited to i changes in the information available regarding the environmental 

impact of the company’s operations and products ii changes in environmental regulations or enforcement policies including efforts to recover natural resource damages iii new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques iv success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties and v the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and thirdparty indemnitors the company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on the current estimate of its probable liabilities and associated expenses

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview

3m is a diversified global manufacturer technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products 3m manages its operations in seven operating business segments health care industrial display and graphics consumer and office safety security and protection services electro and communications and transportation despite continued challenging global economic conditions in 2003 particularly in the united states and europe 3m made significant progress toward its objective of driving longterm sustainable improvements in sales profitability and cash flow in 2003 3m reported record net sales of 18232 billion and record net income of 2403 billion or 302 per diluted share compared with net sales of 16332 billion and net income of 1974 billion or 250 per diluted share in 2002 the combination of an 116 increase in net sales including core volume sales growth of 47 and declining operating expenses as a percent of sales resulted in a 204 operating income profit margin the following table summarizes sales and operating income results in millions by business segment for the years ended december 31

 

sales growth in 2003 was strongest in the display and graphics segment and the safety security and protection services segment helped by sales of display enhancement films used in flat panel devices and sales of respirator masks which benefited from concerns related to severe acute respiratory syndrome sales were also helped by broadbased growth in most of the health care segment and growth related to construction and home improvementhome care in the consumer and office segment electro and communications was the only segment to report a decrease in sales revenues as the telecommunications industry remained weak in 2003 refer to the performance by business segment section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective segments

asia pacific local currency sales increased 198 with the strongest growth in china and korea all seven business segments contributed to this increase us sales revenue improved 21 with growth in five of the seven segments but overall growth was held back by the continued softness in the industrial and electro and communications segments foreign currency translation positively impacted european sales by 153 and 

asia pacific sales by 65 as the us dollar weakened against these currencies refer to the performance by geographic area section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective regions

operating income in 2003 increased by 219 versus 2002 as six of seven business segments posted increases the combination of solid sales growth positive benefits from 3m’s corporate initiatives and savings from the last piece of the 20012002 corporate restructuring program drove the operating income increase these initiatives — six sigma global sourcing effectiveness 3m acceleration eproductivity and indirect cost control — contributed over 400 million in aggregate operating income benefits in 2003 currency impacts related primarily to the weaker us dollar boosted 2003 operating income by an estimated 111 million although the company absorbed a similar amount of expenses via a series of productivity actions

3m generated 3773 billion of operating cash flows in 2003 a 781 million increase over 2002 and ended the year with 1836 billion of cash and cash equivalents cash flow in 2003 was driven by improved net income working capital improvements and tax timing differences in 2003 the company utilized 1719 billion of cash to repurchase 3m common stock and pay dividends and contributed 749 million to its pension plans 3m’s debt to total capital ratio total capital defined as debt plus equity as of december 31 2003 was approximately 27 3m has an aa credit rating from standard  poor’s and an aa1 credit rating from moody’s investors service

in 2004 3m will continue to focus on improving its topline growth rate with primary emphasis on driving higher organic or core growth 3m is looking for broaderbased product performance to contribute to its growth in addition to expected continued growth in optical film products and will also continue to assess potential acquisitions stronger core growth will require both faster growth of existing productsservices and successful introduction of new products including sales of 3m’s immune response modifier pharmaceutical to treat two new indications superficial basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis once anticipated regulatory approval has been obtained the company also is focused on its corporate initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs 3m’s corporate initiatives are expected to contribute an additional 400 million to operating income in 2004 increased pension expense is expected to reduce operating income by approximately 165 million as in 2003 and 2002 the company will consider the need for additional contributions to its pension plans fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also impact results although the company expects to hedge about half of this impact 3m will also continue as it has for many years to incur expenses insured and uninsured in managing its litigation and environmental contingencies by improving organic sales volume growth driving its costs and productivity initiatives and making appropriate disciplined acquisitions 3m expects to achieve solid growth in sales and income for 2004 these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected refer to the forwardlooking statements discussion later in item 7 for discussion of these risks and uncertainties

index to management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of opeations

 

stock split

on august 11 2003 3m’s board of directors declared a twoforone split of the company’s common stock the stock split was in the form of a stock dividend of one additional share for each share owned by stockholders of record and each share held in treasury as of the close of business on september 22 2003 and was distributed on september 29 2003 all share and per share information has been adjusted in the accompanying financial statements and related notes to reflect this split

special items

special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding the company’s ongoing operating results special items are not measures recognized under us generally accepted accounting principles the determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

in 2003 3m recorded pretax charges of 93 million 58 million aftertax or 7 cents per diluted share related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against 3m in 1997 by lepage’s inc the pretax charge of 93 million has been classified as “other expense” within operating income for more detail refer to the discussion of “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this document

in 2002 special items reduced operating income by 202 million and net income by 108 million or 13 cents per diluted share these charges principally related to employee severance and benefit costs accelerated depreciation charges and other associated exit costs under the company’s restructuring plan announced in june 2001 these charges are included in cost of sales 121 million selling general and administrative expenses 77 million and research development and related expenses 4 million for more detail refer to the discussion in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 20012002 corporate restructuring program

in 2001 special items reduced operating income by 504 million and net income by 312 million or 39 cents per diluted share special items of 569 million principally related to the company’s restructuring plan approved in june 2001 were included in cost of sales 249 million selling general and administrative expenses 300 million and research development and related expenses 20 million in addition cost of sales included other special items of 23 million related to acquisition costs special items included in the other expense income line within operating income in 2001 included 73 million of income due to the reversal of a 1999 litigation accrual related to 3m’s successful appeal in january 2002 in an antitrust case brought by lepage’s inc on february 25 2002 the third circuit court of appeals vacated its prior ruling and ordered a rehearing by the full court for the latest developments refer to the discussion of “legal proceedin gs” in part i item 3 of this document also included within the other expense income line within operating income is a net gain of 15 million related to the sale of availableforsale equity securities partially offset by the writedown of permanently impaired availableforsale equity securities

corporate initiatives

in 2003 the company continued to drive its five corporate initiatives six sigma global sourcing effectiveness 3m acceleration eproductivity and indirect cost control aimed at accelerating longterm topline growth improving cash flow and lowering its total cost structure six sigma focuses on higher growth productivity and cash flow global sourcing effectiveness generates savings by leveraging purchasing economies of scale aggressively enforcing supply agreements geographic broadening and eapplications through its 3m acceleration initiative the company is driving towards more and better new product ideas and faster more impactful new product introductions along with reallocating research and development resources to larger more global projects in eproductivity 3m believes it has a significant opportunity to improve productivity for its customers suppliers and for 3m itself indirect cost control focuses on reducing costs not directly associated with products or s ervices in 2004 the company estimates its corporate initiatives could contribute an additional 400 million to operating income there can be no assurance that all of the estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized numerous factors may create offsets to these savings such as the potential for weakness in sales volumes normal increases in compensation and benefits and other inflationary pressures the company estimates that these initiatives provided a combined benefit to operating income of more than 400 million in 2003 after contributing more than 500 million to operating income in 2002

20012002 corporate restructuring program

the 20012002 corporate restructuring program actions were substantially completed by june 30 2002 the company estimates incremental savings under this plan of approximately 100 million on a pretax basis in 2003 primarily in the first half of the year the company estimates incremental savings of 300 million on a pretax basis in 2002 in addition to the 80 million saved in 2001 the majority of these savings were from reduced employee costs information regarding the restructuring is included in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements

currency effects

3m estimates that currency effects net of hedging impacts increased net income by 73 million in 2003 reduced net income by 35 million in 2002 and reduced net income by 94 million in 2001 this estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into us dollars the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks

analysis of changes in income statement lines

net sales 

 

in 2003 core volume growth which excludes the impact of businesses acquired or divested in the last 12 months was led by display enhancement films broadbased growth in most of the health care businesses respirator masks and growth in products related to construction and home improvementhome care acquisitions increased 2003 sales by nearly 2 driven primarily by the december 2002 acquisition of corning precision lens inc on a geographic basis 2003 core volume growth was strongest in the asia pacific area refer to both the “performance by business segment” and “performance by geographic area” sections for additional discussion of sales change

in 2002 the asia pacific area led core volume growth driven by the display and graphics health care industrial and transportation segments core volume declined in the united states with weak overall sales in electro and communications and industrial segments partially offset by good growth in the health care and transportation segments core volume in europe also declined hurt by the continuing downturn in the telecom industry partially offset by higher growth in the health care segment

operating expenses 

 

cost of sales in 2003 benefited from six sigma and other projects aimed at improving manufacturing throughput yield and productivity 3m’s global sourcing initiative has helped mitigate the impact of raw material price increases raw material costs were essentially flat versus 2002 in 2002 gross margins were positively 

impacted by improved plant efficiencies and lower raw material costs again helped by 3m’s global sourcing initiative special items as a percent of sales negatively impacted cost of sales by 07 percentage points in 2002 and 17 percentage points in 2001 cost of sales includes manufacturing engineering and freight costs

selling general and administrative sga expenses as a percent of net sales has improved in each of the past two years sga expenses in us dollars were higher in 2003 due to currency translation as well as increased advertising and merchandising spending the improvement in 2002 sga costs was the result of implementing six sigma indirect cost control programs and employment reductions under the restructuring plan approved in june 2001 sga also benefited by 67 million in 2002 due to the cessation of goodwill amortization and other indefinitelived asset amortization effective january 1 2002 special items negatively impacted sga in 2002 and 2001 77 million or 05 of sales in 2002 300 million or 18 of sales in 2001 excluding these 2002 special items sga for 2003 was relatively flat as a percent of sales compared with 2002

other expense income includes items previously discussed under special items for 2003 this reflects the 93 million pretax charge related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against 3m in 1997 by lepage’s inc for 2001 this includes a reversal of a 1999 litigation accrual of 73 million and a gain of 15 million related to the net impact of the sale and writedown of availableforsale equity securities

operating income 

3m uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools operating income has steadily improved the last two years and in 2003 was 204 of sales although the company faced continued economic weakness operating income grew by 667 million in 2003 or 219 in 2002 operating income grew by 773 million or 34 from 2001 special items negatively impacted operating income in all years presented 93 million or 05 of sales in 2003 202 million or 12 of sales in 2002 and 504 million or 31 of sales in 2001

interest expense and income 

 

interest expense the slight increase in 2003 interest expense was primarily due to a reduced benefit for capitalized interest related to lower capital spending and higher average debt balances being largely offset by lower interest rates declining interest rates on floatingrate debt drove the reduction in expense in 2002

interest income while average cash balances were higher in 2003 interest income decreased due to lower interest rates the increase in 2002 was primarily related to larger average cash balances

provision for income taxes 

 

income taxes associated with repatriating certain cash from outside the united states negatively impacted the 2003 income tax rate

minority interest 

 

minority interest represents the elimination of the non3m ownership interests primarily in sumitomo 3m limited and 3m interunitek gmbh in 2002 and 2001 only the decrease in 2003 relates to 3m’s purchase of the minority interest shares of 3m interunitek gmbh in december 2002 and the purchase of an additional 25 ownership in sumitomo 3m in early 2003 refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these acquisitions the increase in 2002 related primarily to higher profits in 

sumitomo 3m and 3m interunitek gmbh minority interest was positively impacted by special items in 2002 18 million and 2001 8 million

in 2003 local currency growth and total sales growth in the health care segment was broad based geographic area local currency growth was led by the asia pacific area and the latin america africa and canada area with the united states and europe showing moderate growth operating income improvement was also broad based

in the pharmaceuticals business an agreement was reached with eli lilly and company in september of 2001 to collaborate on resiquimod an investigational compound for the treatment of genital herpes 3m received 100 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 from lilly in consideration for research and development efforts revenue was recognized on a prorata basis over the service period 3m recognized 44 million of revenue relating to this agreement in 2003 43 million in 2002 and 7 million in 2001 in the third quarter of 2003 3m and eli lilly reached a final agreement to return control of resiquimod to 3m upon termination of the agreement 3m recognized the remaining revenue with deferral of some immaterial remaining obligations 3m continues to evaluate its strategic options with respect to this potential treatment

the broader family of immune response modifiers continues to progress and 3m expects approval of two new indications for aldara™ imiquimod cream 5 in 2004 these new indications are for actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma potentially serious skin conditions that are a direct result of cumulative sun exposure the patent and related rights for the imiquimod molecule are important to the health care business if approved by the fda the company expects significant sales beginning in 2004 for aldara™ imiquimod 

cream 5 for the treatment of actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma the original patent on the imiquimod molecule expires in august 2004 but the patent term extension runs through august 2009

in 2003 the combined benefit from both the eli lilly agreement and the ivax corporation agreement was partially offset by separation costs in health care resulting in a net benefit to operating income of approximately 20 million

in 2002 sales and operating income growth was led by medical dental and pharmaceutical products local currency growth was negatively impacted by generic competition for 3m’s tambocor™ flecainide acetate pharmaceutical product in december 2002 3m acquired the remaining 43 of outstanding shares of 3m interunitek gmbh parent company of 3m espe dental ag because these results have been consolidated since 2001 when 3m acquired 57 of this business this additional acquisition of the remaining shares had no impact on 2002 sales or operating income of the health care segment

the strong 2003 local currency sales growth in the display and graphics segment was primarily due to optical systems growth including the corning precision lens acquisition that benefited sales by approximately 11 optical systems growth was led by sales of display enhancement films used in flat panel devices geographic area local currency sales growth was led by the asia pacific area and the latin america africa and canada area local currency growth was moderate in the united states and europe optical systems also led display and graphics operating income growth driven primarily by local currency sales growth and its production facilities running at high utilization levels

2003 local currency growth was led by the construction and home improvement home care and stationery products businesses partially offset by lower local currency sales in the visual systems business geographic area local currency growth was moderate in all areas except europe which showed a decline the modest increase in operating income resulted from strong gains in construction and home improvement and home care partially offset by a decrease in visual systems operating income

the decrease in 2002 local currency growth reflected continued office worker layoffs and inventory contraction in the retail channel affecting office supplies construction and home improvement products posted good sales growth and operating income improvement while 3m’s home care and office supply products posted strong operating income improvement six sigma and costs savings from other 3m initiatives drove the operating income improvement

safety security and protection services business 106 of consolidated sales 

 

the safety security and protection services segment strives to increase the safety security and productivity of workers facilities and systems this includes respiratory protection products safety and security products energy control products cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments and roofing granules for asphalt shingles

net sales and operating income 

geographic area

 

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure a portion of the products or components sold by 3m’s international operations to third parties are exported to the united states and other parts of the world thus net sales in a particular geography may not be indicative of enduser consumption in that geography in 2003 3m continued its rapid expansion in emerging economies like china korea and eastern europe complementing 3m’s growth in more mature markets 3m’s largest international subsidiary sumitomo 3m posted strong sales growth and outperformed the sluggish japanese economy for 2003 international operations represented 584 of 3m’s sales with that percentage expected to increase in the years ahead

primarily on years of service and in some cases employee compensation see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension liability and expense

a significant element in determining the company’s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 87 is the expected return on plan assets which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and under certain circumstances amortized over future years of service therefore the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense for the us pension plan the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 90 which is unchanged refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information on how this rate is determined

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the september 30 2003 measurement date for the us plan the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company looks at rates of return on fixedincome investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies by applying this methodology the company determined a discount rate of 600 to be appropriate as of september 30 2003 which is a reduction of 075 percentage points from the rate used as of september 30 2002

for the year ended december 31 2003 the change in the minimum pension liability within accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders’ equity by 173 million aftertax for the us pension plan holding all other factors constant a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 025 percentage points would result in an aftertax increasedecrease of approximately 145 million in accumulated other comprehensive income

for the year ended december 31 2003 the company recognized total consolidated pretax pension expense after settlements curtailments and special termination benefits of 168 million up from 141 million in 2002 pension expense before settlements curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to increase to approximately 310 million in 2004 up approximately 165 million from the comparable number in 2003 for the us pension plans holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by 025 percentage points would decreaseincrease us pension expense by approximately 17 million in 2004 for the us pension plans holding all other factors constant an increasedecrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 025 percentage points would decreaseincrease us pension expense by approximately 23 million in 2004

potential asset impairment issues 

management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these longterm estimates and assumptions because of the long period over which actual results will emerge such risk is mitigated by management’s ability to make changes in these estimates and assumptions over the same long period 3m has approximately 24 billion of goodwill that based on impairment testing is not impaired a portion of th is goodwill approximately 300 million is in 3m’s telecommunications business which the company believes will maintain its value however if unanticipated events impact this sector for an extended period of time it could create future impairment losses

financial condition and liquidity

the company generates significant ongoing cash flow as evidenced by the reduction in net debt during 2003 as follows

 

3m believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected investments and capital expenditures the company has an aa credit rating from standard  poor’s and an aa1 credit rating from moody’s investors service the company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the company’s stock

the company’s financial condition and liquidity at december 31 2003 remain strong various assets and liabilities including cash and shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from monthtomonth depending on shortterm liquidity needs working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled 2638 billion at december 31 2003 increasing 1036 billion from yearend 2002 this increase was largely related to an increase in cash 1218 billion the cash balance benefited from higher net income and certain working capital improvements accounts receivable inventory accounts payable the increase in other current assets was offset by an increase in accrued income taxes the increase in other current assets was primarily due to the reclassification of certain insurance receivables from longterm to current and increases in various prepaid items and deferred taxes the increase in accrued income taxes primarily relates to higher net i ncome a higher effective tax rate and the timing of tax payments

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities eg accounts receivable inventory these measures may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the accounts receivable turnover index defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at yearend – multiplied by four divided by ending net accounts receivable totaled 695 at december 31 2003 an improvement from 655 at yearend 2002 receivables increased 187 million compared with yearend 2002 with currency translation increasing the accounts receivable balance by 222 million due to the weaker us dollar the inventory turnover index defined as quarterly factory cost – fourth quarter at yearend — multiplied by four divided by ending inventory was 512 at december 31 2003 an improvement from 417 at yearend 2002 inventories declined 115 million compared with yearend 2002 despite currency translation increasing the inventory balance by 143 million compared with december 31 2002

cash flows from operating activities 

 

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as pension funding decisions tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows in both 2003 and 2002 cash flows were primarily driven by improved net income certain working capital improvements ie accounts receivables inventories accounts payable and tax timing differences in 2003 and 2002 significant company 

pension contributions negatively impacted cash flow in all years with larger amounts in 2003 and 2002 a portion of the tax timing benefit relates to the tax benefit received from company pension contributions in 2003 3m made 46 million of payments under the corporate restructuring plan compared with 306 million in 2002 and 159 million in 2001

3m’s pension plan assets were below 3m’s accumulated benefit obligation abo at its most recent plan measurement dates for certain plans in the third quarter of 2003 3m made a voluntary special contribution of 600 million to its us qualified pension plan compared with a voluntary special contribution of 789 million in the third quarter of 2002 future contributions will depend on market conditions interest rates and other factors 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities

the company recorded the lepage’s verdict liability of 93 million pretax in the first quarter of 2003 the company increased its estimate of liabilities for the breast implant and respirator maskasbestos claims and litigation in 2003 for a more detailed discussion of these and other legal proceedings refer to part i item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k because of the time delay between payment of claims and receipt of insurance reimbursements the december 31 2003 amounts for both breast implant and respirator maskasbestos liabilities are less than expected insurance recoveries thus the expected net inflow of cash will increase future cash flows the following table shows liability and receivable activity for breast implant and respirator masksasbestos for 2003 and 2002 this table shows the increase in liabilities and associated insurance receivables cash received for insurance cash fees and payments made and the pretax expense by year

cash flows from financing activities 

 

total debt at december 31 2003 was 2937 billion down from 3377 billion at yearend 2002 due to the strong cash flow generated during 2003 there were no new longterm debt issuances in 2003 but the company’s 350 million of dealer remarketable securities classified as shortterm borrowings were remarketed for one year in december 2003 the remarketable securities can be remarketed annually at the option of the dealer for a year each time with a final maturity date of december 2010 total debt was 27 of total capital total capital is defined as debt plus equity compared with 36 at yearend 2002

repurchases of common stock are made to support the company’s stockbased employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes in november 2001 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 25 billion of the company’s common stock this share repurchase authorization was effective from january 1 2002 through december 31 2003 under this authorization the company purchased approximately 97 million shares for 685 million in 2003 compared with approximately 158 million shares for 942 million in 2002 on november 10 2003 the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 15 billion of the company’s common stock between january 1 2004 and december 31 2004

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2003 the company had not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate offbalance sheet financing arrangements 3m’s guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are estimated at approximately 18 million 3m’s accrued product warranty liabilities are estimated at approximately 20 million 3m does not consider these amounts to be material

in addition to guarantees 3m in the normal course of business periodically enters into agreements that require 3m to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel or claims alleging that 3m products infringe third party patents or other intellectual property while 3m’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations

a summary of the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 follows

contractual obligations

 

unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts capital commitments service agreements and utilities these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated the majority of 3m’s products and se rvices are purchased as needed with no unconditional commitment for this reason these numbers will not provide a reliable indicator of the company’s expected future cash outflows on a standalone basis

as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in 2004 thus company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2004 and future years contractual capital commitments are also included in the preceding table but these commitments represent a small part of the company’s expected capital spending in 2004 and beyond for 2004 the company expects to spend approximately 900 million on purchases of property plant and equipment

financial instruments

the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure interest rate risks and commodity price risks a financial risk management committee composed of senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities this committee determines the company’s financial risk policies and objectives and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation risk analysis counterparty credit approval and ongoing monitoring and reporting

the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs the company may enter into interest rate swaps under these arrangements the company agrees to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts price protection swaps and forward physical contracts

a variancecovariance statistical modeling technique was used to test the company’s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss in aftertax earnings of financial instruments derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31 2003 the model thirdparty bank dataset used a 95 confidence level over a 12month time horizon based on this analysis of the company’s interest rate risks possible changes in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on aftertax earnings 6 million at december 31 2003 and 7 million at december 31 2002 based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks possible changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact aftertax earnings 

by 67 million 69 million at december 31 2002 when including certain commodity risks possible changes in commodity rates could adversely impact aftertax earnings by an additional 3 million an additional 11 million at december 31 2002 the model used analyzed over 20 different currencies and five commodities but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company this model does not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results

the company is increasingly striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales which will move costs outside the united states this will also help mitigate the effects from currency fluctuations in 2001 the company increased the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen yearoveryear impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings however this hedging program will not make 3m immune to currency impacts

the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 40 million per year the global energy exposure is such that a 10 price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of approximately 28 million per year derivative instruments are used to hedge less than one percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to partially hedge about 18 of this energy exposure

research patents and raw materials
research and product development constitute an important part of 3ms
activities products resulting from research and development have been a major
driver of 3ms growth research development and related expenses totaled
1070 billion 1084 billion and 1101 billion in 2002 2001 and 2000
respectively research and development covering basic scientific research and
the application of scientific advances to the development of new and improved
products and their uses totaled 738 million 745 million and 727 million in
2002 2001 and 2000 respectively related expenses primarily include technical
support provided by the laboratories for existing products

corporate research laboratories support research efforts of division and market
laboratories  these corporate laboratories also engage in research not
directly related to existing 3m product lines  most major operating divisions
have their own laboratories to improve existing products and develop new
products research staff groups provide specialized services in
instrumentation engineering and process development  3m also maintains an
organization for technological development not sponsored by other units of the
company

3m is the owner of many domestic and foreign patents derived primarily from its
research activities  3ms business as a whole is not materially dependent upon
any one patent license or trade secret or upon any group of related patents
licenses or trade secrets

the company experienced no significant or unusual problems in the purchase of
raw materials during 2002  it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw
materials or the impact any such shortages would have

environmental law compliance
most of 3ms manufacturing operations are affected by federal state and local
environmental laws  3m has made and plans to continue making necessary
expenditures for compliance with applicable laws  3m is also involved in
remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at
certain sites refer to part i item 3 legal proceedings

environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past
operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed
liabilities for remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when
they are probable and reasonably estimable generally no later than the
completion of feasibility studies or the companys commitment to a plan of
action environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to
current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over
their estimated useful lives

in 2002 3m expended about 21 million for capital projects related to the
environment  the comparable amount in 2001 was about 7 million these
amounts exclude expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing
matters caused by past operations capital expenditures for environmental
purposes have included pollution control devicessuch as wastewater treatment
plants groundwater monitoring devices air strippers or separators and
thermal oxidizers  at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in
the normal course of business consistent with policies stressing
environmental responsibility average annual capital expenditures other than
for remediation projects are presently expected to be about 70 million over
the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify
manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions

while we cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup
activities capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental
compliance we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital
expenditures earnings or competitive position

ttem 3 legal proceedings

general

the company and some of its subsidiaries are named defendants in a number of
claims lawsuits and governmental proceedings these include products
liability claims and lawsuits involving products that the company now or
formerly manufactured and sold and environmental proceedings some claimants
seek damages and other relief that if granted would require substantial
expenditures

some of these lawsuits and proceedings raise difficult and complex factual and
legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties such as the facts and
circumstances of the particular lawsuit the jurisdiction and forum in which
the lawsuit is pending and the applicable law  the company records
liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of
the loss and where liability probably will arise the company also records
receivables for the probable amount of insurance that it expects to recover
under the companys insurance program in those instances

the company cannot always definitively determine possible liabilities that
exceed recorded amounts related to the legal proceedings to which it is a
party there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur
charges whether related to products liability antitrust or other
litigation environmental matters or other actions in excess of presently
recorded liabilities however the company believes it unlikely based upon
the nature of the legal proceedings and its current knowledge of relevant
facts and circumstances that the possible liabilities exceeding recorded
amounts would be material individually or in the aggregate to its consolidated
financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to
products liability claims such a conclusion about possible liabilities
considers insurance coverage available for such liabilities

while the company believes that a material adverse impact on its consolidated
financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future
charges is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote
possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development
could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact on
the company given the uncertainty of litigation and in making future
projections the company has and will continue to periodically reexamine its
estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables
and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and
developments in the litigation as a result the current estimates of the
potential impact on the companys consolidated financial position results of
operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in legal
proceedings could change in the future

antitrust litigation

as previously reported lepages inc filed a lawsuit against the company in
june 1997 in the united states district court for the eastern district of
pennsylvania alleging that certain marketing practices of the company violated
the antitrust laws on october 8 1999 the jury awarded lepages damages of
228 million the company recorded a pretax charge of 73 million in the
third quarter of 1999 related to the adverse jury verdict the 228 million
verdict is automatically tripled under the law and attorneys fees and costs
in january 2002 the third circuit court of appeals reversed the trial courts
decision and as a result the company reversed the 73 million pretax
charge on february 25 2002 the third circuit court of appeals vacated its
prior ruling and ordered a rehearing by the full court oral argument on the
appeal was heard on october 30 2002  the company expects the decision of the
third circuit court of appeals during the first or second quarter of 2003

because the company believes that the trial court judgment will
again be overturned no liability has been recorded related to this
matter as of december 31 2002 if the third circuit court of appeals
affirms the trial court judgment and the united states supreme court
declines to review the case the company would incur a pretax



page 10

charge of approximately 85 million related to the adverse jury verdict plus
interest 3m would also be liable for lepages attorneys fees and costs an
amount that has not yet been determined by the court  after the verdict in
the lepages action purchasers of transparent tape filed three class action
lawsuits against the company in california and pennsylvania alleging that
certain marketing practices of the company violated the state or federal
antitrust laws  those actions are pending

breast implant litigation

the company and certain other companies have been named as defendants in a
number of claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of
various types resulting from breast implants formerly manufactured by the
company or a related company the vast majority of claims against the company
have been resolved  claims against the company registered in the revised
class action settlement program approved by the united states district court
for the northern district of alabama the revised settlement program have
been or will be resolved through the revised settlement program the company
has confirmed that approximately 7 remaining claimants who have opted out of
the revised settlement program have 3m implants the company does not consider
its remaining probable liability for these confirmed cases to be material

the companys insurers providing occurrencebased coverage initiated a
declaratory judgment action in ramsey county minnesota against the company
seeking adjudication of certain coverage and allocation issues on february
24 2000 the jury returned a verdict favorable to the company by rejecting
all of the insurers remaining defenses to coverage for breast implant
liabilities and costs

the trial courts rulings in post verdict motions were generally favorable to
the company  the court awarded the company prejudgment interest on amounts
owing by insurers including a portion of the companys reasonable attorneys
fees in connection with the insurance coverage litigation exact amounts
cannot yet be determined the court filed the judgment on april 16 2001 and
entered judgment on may 16 2001 thus substantially concluding this matter in
the trial court the company and several insurers appealed the judgment to the
minnesota court of appeals  on september 24 2002 the minnesota court of
appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial courts judgment the
court of appeals confirmed coverage but allocated the coverage so as to reduce
a substantial portion of the amounts owing by insurers for losses and defense
costs as reflected in the trial court judgment the court of appeals also
reversed the companys award of attorneys fees referenced above on december
17 2002 the minnesota supreme court granted the companys petition for
review permitting the company to appeal the court of appeals decision the
company believes that it is likely to obtain relief in the minnesota supreme
court if the minnesota supreme court does not grant relief as anticipated
the company could be effectively deprived of significant and potentially
material insurance coverage for breast implant claims

the company also initiated an arbitration proceeding in london england to
recover insurance coverage for some of its breast implant liability and costs
from certain claimsmade insurance carriers a hearing was conducted in
january 2003 and the arbitration is expected to be completed in the second
half of 2003 if the panel decides the coverage question in the companys
favor it will then determine the amount of coverage in a subsequent
proceeding

as of december 31 2002 the company had receivables for insurance recoveries
related to the breast implant matter of 339 million representing settled but
yet to be received amounts 16 million as well as amounts contested by the
insurance carriers in the minnesota litigation and the london arbitration
323 million various factors could affect the timing and amount of
insurance proceeds to be received under the companys various insurance
policies including i the outcome of occurrence insurance litigation in the
courts of minnesota as discussed above ii the outcome of the arbitration
with claimsmade insurers in london and iii the extent to which insurers
may become insolvent in the future there can be no absolute assurance that
the company will collect all amounts recorded as being probable of recovery
from its insurers



page 11

respiratormaskasbestos litigation

for more than 20 years the company has successfully defended and resolved the
claims of over 200000 individual claimants alleging injuries from
occupational dust exposures the vast majority of the lawsuits and claims
resolved by the company alleged use of some of the companys mask and
respirator products and sought damages from the company and other defendants
for alleged personal injury from work place exposures to asbestos or less
frequently silica and other occupational dust found in products manufactured
by other defendants the remaining claimants generally alleged personal injury
from occupational exposure to asbestos from unspecified products claimed to
have been manufactured by the company or other defendants andor from
specialty products containing asbestos manufactured by the company andor
other defendants

the companys vigorous defense of this litigation has resulted in i jury
verdicts for the company in two of three cases tried to verdict ii
dismissals of lawsuits without any payment by the company and iii an
average settlement value of less than 1000 per claimant for all of the
claims and lawsuits that the company has resolved in many of these lawsuits
and claims the company is named as a defendant with multiple codefendants
where no product the company manufactured is involved or where the company is
ultimately determined not to have manufactured the products identified by the
plaintiffs

as previously reported in october 2001 the company defended at trial in the
circuit court of holmes county mississippi plaintiffs claims that a 3m
respirator and mask did not protect them against contracting certain asbestos
related diseases allegedly caused by exposure to asbestoscontaining products
manufactured by other defendants the case against the company initially
involved six plaintiffs whose claims were consolidated for trial the court
dismissed one plaintiffs case just before trial and a second plaintiff
abandoned his case before it was submitted to the jury on october 26 2001
the jury returned verdicts against all defendants in favor of the plaintiffs
four of whom had claims against the company the jury awarded the plaintiffs
25 million each in compensatory damages the jury denied plaintiffs request
for punitive damages based on the jurys findings of percentage of fault
attributable to each defendant the companys share of the total of the four
verdicts against it is 225 million the company can provide no assurance at
this time about the ability of the other two codefendants to pay their
respective shares of any ultimate judgment or whether a codefendants
inability to pay will cause a reallocation of the liability for damages among
the remaining solvent defendants under state law one of the codefendants
acands has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection another codefendant
dresser industries is a subsidiary of halliburton company which announced on
december 18 2002 a global settlement agreement of all personal injury
asbestos claims against halliburton company and its subsidiaries the company
does not know at this time the impact of the settlement agreement on the
judgment in the mississippi case against dresser industries judgment was
entered on january 30 2002 the trial court denied the companys posttrial
motions in a decision on august 21 2002 and the company filed a notice of
appeal with the mississippi supreme court  because the company believes that
the judgment ultimately will be overturned no liability has been recorded
related to this matter as of december 31 2002 if any damages are ultimately
assessed against the company the company expects a substantial portion of
such damages to be covered by the companys product liability insurance

as of december 31 2002 the company is a named defendant with multiple
codefendants in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to
represent approximately 45000 individual claimants the vast majority
of these current claimants allege use of some of the companys mask and
respirator products and seek damages from the company and other defendants
for alleged personal injury from work place exposures to asbestos or
less frequently silica and other occupational dust found in products
manufactured by other defendants the remaining claimants generally allege
personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from unspecified
products claimed to have been manufactured by the company or other defendants
andor from specialty products containing asbestos manufactured by the company
andor other defendants the company settled an unusually large number of
pending claims during 2002 and thus had a substantial reduction in the number of



page 12

open claims  from approximately 80000 claimants at the end of 2001 to
approximately 45000 at the end of 2002

in the fourth quarter of 2002 the company was served with complaints
identifying approximately 6000 claimants in mississippi we believe that this
activity is related to tort reform legislation adopted in mississippi in
november 2002 that went into effect on january 1 2003 and that the new cases
were filed in anticipation of the new law  we expect to see an additional
increase in mississippi claims in the first quarter as there is often a delay
between the filing of complaints and service of the complaints on the company

plaintiffs have asserted specific dollar claims for damages in only about one
sixth of the 7404 lawsuits that were pending against the company at the end
of 2002 in all jurisdictions a majority of states restrict or prohibit
specifying damages in tort cases such as these and most of the remaining
jurisdictions do not require such specification  in those cases in which
plaintiffs choose to assert specific dollar amounts in their complaints
brought in states that permit such pleading the amounts claimed are typically
not meaningful as an indicator of the companys potential liability  this is
because a the amounts claimed typically bear no relation to the level of
plaintiffs injury if any b the complaints nearly always assert claims
against multiple defendants with the typical complaint asserting claims
against an average of 88 different defendants the damages alleged are not
attributed to individual defendants and a defendants share of liability may
turn on the law of joint and several liability which can vary by state and
by the amount of fault a jury allocates to each defendant if a case is
ultimately tried before a jury c many cases are filed against the company
even though the plaintiffs did not use any of the companys products and
ultimately are withdrawn or dismissed without any payment and d many cases
are brought on behalf of plaintiffs who have not suffered any medical injury
and ultimately are resolved without any payment or a payment that is a small
fraction of the damages initially claimed of the 1274 pending cases in which
purported damage amounts are specified in the complaints 579 cases involve
claims of 100000 or less 177 cases involve claims between 100000 and 3
million 37 of these cases also allege punitive damages of 250000 and 42 of
these cases also allege punitive damages of 25 million 117 cases involve
claims of 75 million with an equal amount of punitive damages 365 cases
involve claims of 10 million 316 of which also allege an equal amount in
punitive damages 3 cases involve claims of 15 million 2 cases involve
claims of 20 million and 31 cases involve claims of 50 million 5 of which
also allege punitive damages of 5 million some complaints allege that the
compensatory and punitive damages are at least the amounts specified as noted
above the company has more than 20 years of experience in defending
litigations of this type and has to date resolved the claims of over 200000
plaintiffs  the cumulative average settlement amount is less than 1000 per
claimant based on this experience and for the other reasons noted above the
company believes that the damage amounts specified in complaints are not a
meaningful factor in any assessment of the companys potential liability

as of december 31 2002 the company had estimated accrued liabilities of
approximately 161 million for respiratormask asbestos related claims a
substantial portion of which the company expects to be covered by its product
liability insurance  this amount represents the companys best estimate of
the amount to cover the cost and expense of resolving recently settled
current and probable future respiratormask asbestos related claims the
company also had receivables for expected insurance recoveries of
approximately 264 million various factors could affect the timing and amount
of proceeds to be received under the companys various insurance policies
including i the timing of payments made in settlement of claims ii delays
in or avoidance of payment by insurers and iii the extent to which insurers
may become insolvent in the future there can be no absolute assurance that
the company will collect all amounts recorded as being probable of recovery
from its insurers

the difference between the accrued liability and insurance
receivable represents the time delay between payment of claims and
receipt of insurance reimbursements because of the lag time between
settlement and payment of a claim no meaningful conclusions may be
drawn from quarterly changes in the amount of receivables for



page 13

expected insurance recoveries and the quarterly changes in the number of
claimants at the end of each quarter

the companys current estimate of its probable liabilities and associated
expenses for respiratormaskasbestos litigation is based on facts and
circumstances existing at this time  recent developments in the mix of newly
filed respiratormask lawsuits some increase in the proportion of silica
related claims and the defense costs associated with the companys continued
aggressive defense strategy will be closely monitored by the company in the
near term  additional developments may occur that could affect the companys
estimate of probable liabilities and associated expenses these developments
include but are not limited to i significant changes in the number of
future claims ii significant changes in the average cost of resolving
claims iii significant changes in the legal costs of defending these
claims and in maintaining trial readiness iv changes in the nature of
claims received v changes in the law and procedure applicable to these
claims vi financial viability of other codefendants and insurers and
vii other unknown variables the company cannot determine the impact of
these potential developments on the current estimate of its probable
liabilities and associated expenses

environmental matters

the companys operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations
enforceable by foreign federal state and local authorities and private
parties in the united states and abroad including those pertaining to air
emissions wastewater discharges toxic substances and the handling and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes these laws and regulations provide
under certain circumstances a basis for the remediation of contamination as
well as personal injury and property damage claims the company has incurred
and will continue to incur costs and capital expenditures in complying with
these laws and regulations defending potential personal injury and property
damage claims and modifying its business operations in light of its
environmental responsibilities in its effort to satisfy its environmental
responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations the
company has established and periodically updates policies relating to
environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide

under certain environmental laws including the united states comprehensive
environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and similar
state laws the company may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of
environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at offsite
locations the company has identified numerous locations most of which are in
the united states at which it may have some liability amounts expensed for
environmental remediation activities were not material at these locations nor
have there been material changes in the recorded liabilities for environmental
matters

liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation are depending on
the site based primarily upon internal or thirdparty environmental studies
and estimates as to the number participation level and financial viability of
any other potentially responsible parties the extent of the contamination and
the nature of required remedial actions recorded liabilities are adjusted as
further information develops or circumstances change the company expects that
the amounts recorded will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the
applicable sites currently ranging up to 30 years as of december 31 2002
the company had recorded liabilities of 37 million for estimated
environmental investigatory and remediation costs based upon an evaluation of
currently available facts with respect to each individual site

it is often difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance
and remediation and potential claims given the uncertainties regarding
the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws
and regulations the extent of environmental contamination and the
existence of alternate cleanup methods the companys current assessment
of the probable liabilities and associated expenses related to such
environmental matters is based on the facts and circumstances known at
this time new developments may occur that could affect the companys
assessment these developments include but are not limited to i



page 14

changes in the information available regarding the environmental impact
of the companys operations and products ii changes in environmental
regulations or enforcement policies including efforts to recover
natural resource damages iii new and evolving analytical and
remediation techniques iv success in allocating liability to other
potentially responsible parties and v financial viability of other
potentially responsible parties and thirdparty indemnitors the company
cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on the current
estimate of its probable liabilities and associated expenses

the company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by the
environmental protection agency epa and international agencies of the
possible environmental and health effects of perfluorooctanyl chemistry as
previously announced the company has been phasing out its production of such
compounds  with respect to one such compound the epa is currently considering
possible regulatory action under its statutory authority relating to compounds
that may pose possible human health effects  the company recently confirmed
to the epa its intent to continue its ongoing health and environmental
investigation and assessment of this compound as a result of its phaseout
decision the company no longer manufactures that compound except that a
subsidiary produces limited quantities for its own industrial use  the
company cannot predict what regulatory action if any may be taken regarding
some or all of such compounds or the consequences of any such action

on september 30 2002 a former employee filed an amended complaint against
the company in the circuit court of morgan county alabama seeking unstated
compensatory and punitive damages and alleging that the plaintiffs suffered
fear increased risk and sub clinical injuries from exposure to
perfluorooctanyl chemistry at or near the companys decatur alabama
manufacturing facility  the complaint also alleges that the company acted
improperly with respect to disclosures to workers concerning such chemistry
recently the plaintiffs sought to add as plaintiffs another former employee
a current employee and their minor children the company believes that these
allegations have no merit and is vigorously defending these claims

the company has agreed to enter into a consent agreement with the state of new
york department of environmental conservation for alleged violations of the
new york air emissions regulations the proposed agreement calls for a penalty
of 212000 a portion of which will be used to improve processes at the
companys tonawanda new york manufacturing facility

as previously reported the company entered into a voluntary agreement with
the epa under both an agreement for tsca compliance and the epas incentives
for self policing policy  the company voluntarily conducted an audit under
the toxic substances control act tsca of its facilities and business units
and to identify studies that under current epa guidelines could be potentially
subject to notification under tsca section 8e the company has reached an
agreement in principle with the epa under which it would pay 222000 in
penalties in connection with the first two phases of this audit relating to
perfluorooctanyl chemistry studies  the third phase relating to this and
other chemistries is expected to be completed in early 2003

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and

forwardlooking statements
this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the
meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995  these
statements may be identified by the use of words like plan expect aim
believe project anticipate intend estimate will should
could and other expressions that indicate future events and trends all
statements that address expectations or projections about the future
including statements about the companys strategy for growth product
development market position expenditures and financial results are forward
looking statements

forwardlooking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations
of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties actual future
results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those
projected in any such forwardlooking statements depending on a variety of
factors including but not limited to the following

 the effects of and changes in worldwide economic conditions the company
operates in more than 60 countries and derives more than half of its revenues
from outside the united states  the companys business may be affected by
factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control
such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region
social political or labor conditions in a specific country or region or
potential adverse foreign tax consequences

 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect
the companys ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and net
earnings and its results of operations because the company derives more than
half its revenues from outside the united states its ability to realize
projected growth rates in sales and net earnings and results of operations
could be adversely affected if the united states dollar strengthens
significantly against foreign currencies

 the companys growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and
market acceptance of its new product offerings including its ability to renew
its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market  this
ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product
development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain
adequate intellectual property protection gain market acceptance of new
products or successfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory
approvals as with any pharmaceutical under development there are substantial
risks and uncertainties in the process of development and regulatory review
there are no guarantees that products will receive regulatory approvals or
prove to be commercially successful

 the companys future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs of
purchased components and materials due to market demand currency exchange
risks shortages and other factors the company depends on various components
and materials for the manufacturing of its products  although the company has
not experienced any difficulty in obtaining components and materials it is
possible that any of its supplier relationships could be terminated in the
future any sustained interruption in the companys receipt of adequate
supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company  in addition
while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and
material pricing no assurance can be given that the company will be able to
successfully manage price fluctuations due to market demand currency risks
or shortages or that future price fluctuations will not have a material
adverse effect on the company

 the possibility that acquisitions divestitures and strategic alliances may
not meet sales andor profit expectations as part of the companys strategy
for growth the company has made and may continue to make acquisitions
divestitures and strategic alliances however there can be no absolute
assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to the company



page 17

 the company is the subject of various legal proceedings the current
estimates of the potential impact on the companys consolidated financial
position results of operations and cash flows for its legal proceedings and
claims are predictions made by the company about the future and should be
considered forwardlooking statements these estimates could change in the
future for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the
company see the discussion of legal proceedings in part i item 3 of this
annual report on form 10k

critical accounting estimates

as stated in our significant accounting policies in note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements the preparation of financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions the company believes its most
critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings potential asset
impairment issues and the companys pension and postretirement obligations

legal proceedings
the companys core activities relate to the development manufacture and sale
of thousands of products to numerous markets while this risk dispersion
provides a measure of overall stability it also results in legal risks in
some areas  the company records liabilities in those instances where it can
reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability probably will
arise the company also records receivables for the probable amount of
insurance that it expects to recover under the companys insurance program in
those instances the company cannot always definitively determine possible
liabilities that exceed recorded amounts related to the legal proceedings to
which it is a party there can be no certainty that the company may not
ultimately incur charges whether related to products liability antitrust or
other litigation environmental matters or other actions in excess of
presently recorded liabilities however the company believes it unlikely
based upon the nature of the legal proceedings and its current knowledge of
relevant facts and circumstances that the possible liabilities exceeding
recorded amounts would be material individually or in the aggregate to its
consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

known legal risks include the ultimate collection of breast implant insurance
receivables a matter currently in dispute with the companys insurance
carriers respiratormaskasbestos insurance receivables collection and
probable liabilities and an outstanding lawsuit filed by lepages
incorporated that extends back to 1997

summary amounts concerning the breast implant and respiratormaskasbestos

at december 31 2002 the company has accrued receivables of 339 million
relating to breast implants  of this 339 million 16 million represents
settled but yet to be received amounts while 323 million has been contested
by insurance carriers the company believes that it is likely to obtain
relief in the minnesota supreme court if the minnesota supreme court does
not grant relief as anticipated the company could be effectively deprived of
significant and potentially material insurance coverage for breast implant
claims as part of the companys efforts to recover the amounts contested by
the insurance carriers the company also initiated an arbitration proceeding
in london england to recover insurance coverage for breast implant
liability and costs from claimsmade insurance carriers the arbitration
hearing will first consider whether the policy provides insurance coverage
for the companys breast implant liability and costs if the panel favorably
decides the coverage question for the company it will then determine the
amount of coverage in a subsequent hearing later in 2003

the companys remaining respiratormaskasbestos liability is 161 million at
december 31 2002  this estimate represents the companys best estimate of
its liability if amounts are paid in settlement of claims or if any damages
are ultimately assessed against the company in current or future litigation a
substantial portion of such amounts is expected to be covered by the companys
product liability insurance  various factors could affect the timing and
amount of proceeds to be received under the companys various insurance
policies including i the timing of payments made in settlement of claims
ii delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers and iii the extent to
which insurers may become insolvent in the future there can be no certainty
that the company will collect all amounts recorded as being probable of
recovery from its insurers

3m has not recorded any liability for the lepages incorporated litigation as
of december 31 2002  3m expects to prevail in this litigation but if 3m
does not prevail 3m would incur a pretax charge of approximately 85
million  3m would also be potentially liable for lepages attorneys fees and
costs

potential asset impairment issues
there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the
consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over
long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets
employed in the business including assets of acquired businesses  these
estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically
adjusted as circumstances warrant for instance expected asset lives may be
shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of
the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit  although
there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these longterm
estimates and assumptions because of the long period over which actual results
will emerge such risk is mitigated by managements ability to make changes in
these estimates and assumptions over the same long period 3m has
approximately 19 billion of goodwill that based on impairment testing is
not impaired a portion of this goodwill approximately 220 million is in
3ms telecommunications business which the company believes will maintain its
value  however if unanticipated events impact this sector for an extended
period of time it could create future impairment losses

pension and postretirement obligations
pension expense impacted 2002 earnings by 16 cents per diluted share compared
with pension expense of 8 cents per diluted share in 2001 the company expects
pension expense to increase approximately another 10 cents per diluted share
in 2003 largely attributed to unrecognized losses on pension assets related
to equity market weakness the last few years in accounting for pension and
postretirement benefits costs and related liabilities are developed using
actuarial valuations  these valuations include key assumptions determined by
management including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return
on plan assets  for the united states pension plan expense calculation for
2003 the companys longterm rate of return on asset assumption remains at 9
percent and its yearend 2002 discount rate assumption is 675 percent which
is used for 2003 expense calculations which represents a half percentage
point reduction from the yearend 2001 discount rate the discount rate
decrease is consistent with changes in highquality longterm corporate bond
indices  the expected longterm rate of return assumption considers the asset
mix of the plans approximately 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent
fixed income past performance and other factors  estimates and assumptions
concerning the companys pension and postretirement obligations and related
periodic cost can be found in note 14 to the consolidated financial
statements material changes in pension and postretirement benefit costs may
occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  future annual
amounts could be impacted by changes in the number of plan participants
changes in the level of benefits provided changes in the discount rates
changes in the expected longterm rate of return changes in the level of
contributions to these plans and other factors a quarter percentage point
change in the discount rate would impact 3ms pension expense by approximately
32 million on a pretax basis  a quarter percentage point change in the
expected longterm rate of return would impact 3ms pension expense by
approximately 23 million on a pretax basis



page 19

based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies
management believes that the companys consolidated financial statements
provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company this is not to
suggest that other general risk factors such as changes in worldwide economic
conditions fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates achievement of
corporate growth objectives changes in material costs performance of
acquired businesses and others could not adversely impact the companys
consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows in
future periods

operating results

overview
net income totaled 1974 billion or 499 per diluted share compared with
1430 billion or 358 per diluted share in 2001 and 1782 billion or
445 per diluted share in 2000  in the first half of 2002 net income was
impacted by nonrecurring charges of 108 million or 27 cents per diluted
share related to the companys restructuring program that was approved in june
2001  in 2002 currency effects reduced earnings by 8 cents per diluted share
while the adoption of a new accounting standard resulting in the cessation of
goodwill amortization and other indefinitelived intangible asset amortization
increased earnings by 12 cents per diluted share in 2001 net income was
impacted by nonrecurring charges of 312 million or 78 cents per diluted
share primarily related to the restructuring program approved in june 2001
in 2000 net income was impacted by nonrecurring charges of 90 million or 23
cents per diluted share additional details concerning nonrecurring items
follow

nonrecurring items
in january 2003 the securities and exchange commission issued regulation g
conditions for use of nongaap financial measures a rule directed by the
sarbanesoxley act of 2002  this rule requires public companies that disclose
or release nongaap financial measures to include the most directly comparable
gaap financial measure to provide a reconciliation of the disclosed nongaap
measure to the most comparable gaap measure and requires companies to furnish
earnings releases or similar announcements to the commission on form 8k
this rule will apply to all subject disclosures as of march 28 2003  the
rule also provides guidance on what constitutes nonrecurring infrequent or
unusual as applied to specific financial transactions or events  the company
currently provides reconciliations of its disclosed nongaap financial
reporting to the most comparable gaap financial reporting

in addition to regulation g the sec amended item 10 of regulation sk to
provide additional guidance to registrants that include nongaap financial
measures in sec filings  this guidance would prohibit the presentation of
certain nongaap financial measures that exclude from reported results non
recurring infrequent or unusual items when the nature of the charge or gain
is such that is it reasonably likely to recur within two years or there was a
similar charge or gain within the prior two years  this guidance could result
in changes in the companys future presentation of nongaap financial
measures

in 2002 nonrecurring charges reduced operating income by 202 million and net
income by 108 million  these charges principally related to employee
severance and benefit costs accelerated depreciation charges and other
associated exit costs under the companys restructuring plan announced in june
2001  these charges are included in cost of sales 121 million selling
general and administrative expenses 77 million and research development
and related expenses 4 million of the total 2002 charges 111 million
related to employee severance and benefit costs 47 million related to
accelerated depreciation of property plant and equipment incremental charges
resulting from shortened depreciable lives of affected assets primarily
related to downsizing or consolidating manufacturing operations and 44
million related to other exit activities other exit activities included
incremental costs and contractual obligations for items such as lease
termination payments and other facility exit costs such as demolition of
buildings inventory disposals other incurred as a direct result of the plan
additional information concerning nonrecurring items is provided in the
notes to consolidated financial statements and elsewhere herein

in 2001 nonrecurring items reduced operating income by 504 million and net
income by 312 million or 78 cents per diluted share   nonrecurring items of
569 million principally related to the companys restructuring plan approved
in june 2001 were included in cost of sales 249 million selling general
and administrative expenses 300 million and research development and
related expenses 20 million of this 569 million 472 million related to
employee severance and benefits 80 million related to accelerated
depreciation of property plant and equipment and 17 million related to other
exit activities  in addition cost of sales included other nonrecurring costs
of 23 million related to acquisitions  nonrecurring items included in the
other expense income line within operating income included 73 million of
income due to the reversal of a 1999 litigation accrual related to 3ms
successful appeal in january 2002 in an antitrust case brought by lepages inc
on february 25 2002 the third circuit court of appeals vacated its prior
ruling and ordered a rehearing in may 2002 by the full court  oral arguments
on the appeal were heard on october 30 2002 and the company expects a
decision in 2003  however the company continues to believe that it will
ultimately prevail in the outcome of this matter  also included within the
other expense income line within operating income is a net gain of 15
million related to the sale of availableforsale equity securities partially
offset by the writedown of permanently impaired availableforsale equity
securities

in 2000 nonrecurring items reduced net income by 90 million or 23 cents per
diluted share  operating income was reduced by 23 million including costs of
208 million reported in cost of sales and gains of 185 million and
reported in the other expense income line within operating income  non
recurring costs in 2000 included 168 million of costs in the specialty
material segment related to the companys phaseout of perfluorooctanylbased
chemistry products a 20 million writedown of corporate and unallocated
assets and 20 million of other nonrecurring expenses 13 million related to
acquisitions in the electro and communications segment  major noncash costs
included in the previously mentioned items were 73 million of accelerated
depreciation and 48 million of impairment losses primarily related to
production equipment used to manufacture products phased out in the specialty
material segment nonrecurring gains in 2000 were largely related to asset
dispositions principally the sale of availableforsale equity securities and
also included 50 million from the termination of a product distribution
agreement in the health care segment  a cumulative effect of accounting change
that related to a change in the companys revenue recognition policy was also
recorded in 2000 reducing net income by 75 million

pro forma amounts excluding nonrecurring items
the company believes that discussion of results excluding significant non
recurring items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends  the
pro forma amounts which exclude nonrecurring items that follow are not in
accordance with or preferable to amounts determined in conformity with us
generally accepted accounting principles  reference should be made to the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for additional
information concerning nonrecurring items and for additional information on
amounts determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting
principles  there is discussion of operating measures that exclude non
recurring items within this operating results section the determination of
nonrecurring items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
other companies an  is used to crossreference such subsequent discussion
to this paragraph

cost of sales for 2002 was 520 percent of net sales down 25 percentage
points from 2001 excluding nonrecurring charges cost of sales for 2002 was
513 percent of sales down 15 percentage points from 2001 gross margins
were positively impacted by improved plant efficiencies lower raw material
costs and 3ms global sourcing initiative  in 2001 slowing worldwide market
demand and negative currency impacts reduced gross margins  cost of sales
includes manufacturing engineering and freight costs

selling general and administrative sga expenses for 2002 were 228 percent
of net sales down 23 percentage points from 2001  excluding nonrecurring
charges sga expenses were 223 percent of net sales a decrease of
10 percentage point from 2001 excluding nonrecurring items sga
spending totaled 3643 billion in 2002 a decrease of 25 percent
from 2001  this improvement in sga costs was the result of implementing
six sigma indirect cost control programs controlling those expenses not
directly associated with 3m products and services and employment
reductions under the restructuring plan approved in june 2001  sga
also benefited by 67 million due to the cessation of goodwill amortization
and other indefinitelived asset amortization effective january 1 2002
excluding nonrecurring charges in 2001 sga was 233 percent of
sales which was a decrease of threetenths of one percentage point from



page 24

the prior year  this decrease in 2001 spending was due to cost
savings generated from 3ms indirect cost initiative and lower employment
levels

operating income
operating income is used by 3m as one of its primary business segment
performance measurement tools  operating income excludes interest expense
interest income the provision for income taxes and minority interest
operating income in 2002 was 187 percent of net sales compared with 142
percent in 2001  excluding nonrecurring charges operating income in 2002 was
199 percent of net sales compared with 173 percent in 2001  although
the company faced continued economic weakness operating income excluding non
recurring items grew by 471 million or 170 percent from 2001 the cessation
of goodwill amortization and other indefinitelived asset amortization
benefited operating income by 67 million while currency impacts reduced
operating income by an estimated 60 million excluding nonrecurring items
2001 operating income totaled 2777 billion or 173 percent of sales
compared to 184 percent of sales in 2000  this decrease was due to slowing
worldwide market demand and negative currency effects  excluding non
recurring items operating income margins in 2002 were 159 percent in the
united states and 232 percent internationally

interest expense and income
net interest expense interest expense less interest income in 2002 was 41
million which was 46 million lower than the prior year  interest expense was
80 million in 2002 124 million in 2001 and 111 in 2000  declining rates
on floatingrate debt drove the reduction in expense in 2002  the increase in
2001 reflected higher average debt levels partially offset by lower interest
rates  interest income was 39 million in 2002 37 million in 2001 and 27
million in 2000   the increase in both 2002 and 2001 interest income primarily
related to larger average cash balances

provision for income taxes
the worldwide effective income tax rate for 2002 was 321 percent the same as
2001  excluding nonrecurring items the worldwide effective income tax rate
in 2002 was 325 percent down from 329 percent the prior year
excluding nonrecurring items the tax rate decrease compared to total year
2001 was primarily due to a lower average effective tax rate for international
operations the effective tax rate in 2000 was 345 percent  the effective tax
rate decrease in 2001 when compared to 2000 related to the impact of recurring
tax credits on lower profit levels

minority interest
minority interest expense was 65 million in 2002 54 million in 2001 and 92
million in 2000  excluding nonrecurring items minority interest was 83
million in 2002 and 62 million in 2001 minority interest represents the
elimination of the non3m ownership interests primarily in sumitomo 3m limited
and 3m interunitek gmbh in 2002 and 2001 only the increase in 2002 related
primarily to higher profits in sumitomo 3m and 3m interunitek gmbh  the
decrease in 2001 was driven by lower profits in sumitomo 3m  in 2003 3m
expects lower minority interest expense  this reduction is expected due to the
purchase of the minority interest shares of 3m interunitek gmbh in december
2002 and the purchase of an additional 25 percent ownership interest in
sumitomo 3m in early 2003  refer to note 3 in the consolidated financial
statements for additional information on these acquisitions

net income
net income totaled 1974 billion or 499 per diluted share compared
with 1430 billion or 358 per diluted share in 2001 and 1782 billion
or 445 per diluted share in 2000  nonrecurring charges negatively

employment
at december 31 2002 employment totaled 68774 people a decrease of 2895
people from yearend 2001  since march 31 2001 employment has declined by
approximately 8900 people with 6900 of the decline related to the
restructuring plan and 3500 of the decline due to the integration of
acquisitions and attrition  these decreases were partially offset by the
corning precision lens inc acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002 that
added about 1500 people  sales per employee in local currencies increased
about 9 percent in 2002 decreased about 3 percent in 2001 and increased about
7 percent in 2000

operating initiatives
the company will continue to press ahead with its five corporate initiatives
six sigma global sourcing effectiveness 3m acceleration indirect cost
reduction and eproductivity aimed at accelerating longterm topline growth
improving cash efficiency and lowering its total cost structure  six sigma
focuses on higher growth lower costs and greater cash flow  global sourcing
effectiveness generates savings through buying smarter managing supply
agreements geographic broadening and eapplications  3m acceleration
reallocates research and development resources to larger more global projects
indirect cost reduction focuses on reducing costs not directly associated with
products or services  in eproductivity 3m believes it has a significant
digitization opportunity the company estimates that these initiatives
provided a combined benefit on a pretax basis of more than 500 million in
2002  in 2003 the company estimates these initiatives could contribute on
a pretax basis an additional 300 million compared to 2002  there can be no
assurance that all of the estimated cost savings from such activities will be
realized  numerous factors may create offsets to these savings such as the
potential for continued weakness in sales volumes normal increases in
compensation and benefits and other inflationary pressures

restructuring charges
during the first half of 2001 the company developed and announced a
restructuring plan that consolidates certain operations and streamlines the
organization to increase speed and productivity  in june 2001 the company
completed the identification of the significant actions to be taken and
obtained approvals from the appropriate level of management in the fourth
quarter of 2001 the company obtained approvals for certain additional actions
these actions were substantially completed by june 30 2002

in the first six months of 2002 3m incurred 202 million of pretax expenses
relating to the restructuring plan the 2002 charges relate to employee
severance and benefits 111 million accelerated depreciation 47 million
and other 44 million  during 2001 3m incurred 569 million of pretax
expenses principally related to the restructuring plan the 2001 charges relate
to employee severance and benefits 472 million accelerated depreciation
80 million and other 17 million the company has not discontinued any
major product lines as a result of this restructuring

in connection with its restructuring plan the company eliminated a total of
about 6900 positions these positions represent a wide range of functions
throughout the company  of the 6900 employment reduction for the total plan
about 45 percent occurred in the united states 30 percent in europe and the
balance in other international areas all business segments were impacted
directly and also indirectly through reduced allocations of corporate staff
service costs the impact of the total restructuring including the allocated
portion of restructured staff services is estimated by segment as follows
industrial 35 percent electro and communications 20 percent transportation
graphics and safety 20 percent health care 10 percent consumer and office
10 percent and specialty material 5 percent these estimates are provided
only as a frame of reference as to the order of magnitude by segment in order
to enhance segment comparability and reflect managements focus on ongoing
operations these restructuring costs have not been recorded in the individual
business segments



page 26

related to this restructuring plan the company estimates it saved on a pre
tax basis 300 million in 2002 in addition to the 80 million saved in 2001
the company estimates an additional 120 million of incremental savings on a
pretax basis in 2003  the majority of the savings will be reduced employee
costs  the 2002 savings were spread across cost of sales sga and research
development and related expenses the 2001 savings were most prominent in
sga with cost of sales benefits occurring in late 2001 numerous factors may
create offsets to these savings such as the potential for continued weakness
in sales volumes normal increases in compensation and benefits and other
inflationary pressures

of the companys remaining current liability at december 31 2002 30 million
is classified in current liabilities payroll and 18 million is classified in
other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet the company
classified as longterm liabilities 43 million of its 2002 charges and 124
million of its 2001 charges special termination pension and medical benefits
aggregating 43 million in 2002 and 62 million in 2001 were offered to
eligible employees these benefits will generally be paid over their life

deferred in 2001 47 million was reclassified to current in 2002 the company
also recorded 3 million of noncash stock option expense 8 million in 2001
due to the reclassification of certain employees age 50 and older to retiree
status resulting in a modification of their original stock option awards for
accounting purposes the current liabilities and a portion of the noncurrent
liabilities will be funded through cash provided by operations while funding
for certain longterm special termination pension and medical liabilities will
be provided through established pension and postretirement trust funds  the
majority of the longterm portion of the liability primarily special
termination pension and medical liabilities is reflected as a component of
3ms pension and medical trust plans as a portion of the accumulated benefit
obligation abo  it is estimated that 3ms benefit plans reflect
approximately 100 million of restructuring related longterm liabilities that
have not yet been paid out as of december 31 2002

based on this analysis of the companys interest rate risks possible changes
in interest rates would not adversely impact aftertax earnings by a material
amount 7 million at december 31 2002 and 6 million at december 31 2001
based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks possible changes
in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact aftertax earnings by 40
million 57 million at december 31 2001  in 2002 the actual currency
impact did not exceed the valueatrisk aftertax amount of 40 million  this
model analyzed more than 20 different currencies but does not purport to
represent what actually will be experienced by the company  this model does
not include certain hedge transactions because the company believes their
inclusion would not materially impact the results

the company is increasingly striving to more closely align its manufacturing
and sourcing with geographic market sales which will move costs outside the
united states this will also help mitigate the effects from currency
fluctuations in 2001 the company increased the amount and duration of its
foreign currency hedges to help lessen yearoveryear impacts and to improve
the predictability of future earnings however this hedging program will not
make 3m immune to currency impacts

sensitivity analysis was used to assess commodity risks  the technique used
evaluates the effect that changes in the market value of commodities will have
on the companys commodity derivative instruments  at yearend 2002 and 2001
the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments
assuming a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying commodity price was not
material 1 million after tax at december 31 2002 and 4 million after tax
at december 31 2001

the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such
that a one percent price change would result in a pretax cost or savings of
approximately 40 million per year  derivative instruments are used to
partially hedge about one percent of this exposure the global energy exposure
is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pretax cost or
savings of approximately 30 million per year  derivative instruments are used
to partially hedge about 15 percent of this energy exposure
