we are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account 

we derive the majority of our revenue from either commissions or fees for brokerage or consulting services we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations our fees for consulting services are spread across a variety of complementary businesses that generally remain steady during times of uncertainty we have some businesses such as our health and benefits and administration businesses which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change 

impact of covid19 and related economic impacts 

over the last two years the covid19 pandemic generally did not have a material adverse impact on our overall financial results initially the pandemic had a negative impact on our revenue growth primarily in our businesses that are discretionary in nature however we later saw an increased demand for these services which improved revenue growth beginning in the second quarter of 2021 there continues to be increased demand for our services particularly those services that address the various challenges in the global labor markets and disruptions to the supply chain while we believe we have adapted to the unique challenges posed by the pandemic surrounding how and where we do our work we are also impacted by workforce availability and this may make it difficult for us to meet the demand from our clients covid19 also poses a range of other risks and uncertainties for our business for information regarding the impact of covid19 on our business and measures we have taken in response see item 7 ‘management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsrisks and uncertainties of the covid19 pandemic and the related economic environment’ and item 1a ‘risk factorsstrategic operational and technology riskswe have been impacted by the covid19 pandemic and may be substantially and negatively impacted by it in the future’

human capital 

colleague experience – our colleague experience is an important differentiating factor for wtw it is designed to provide interesting and meaningful work development and recognition opportunities foster an inclusive environment where everyone can be their authentic selves innovate and lead in the market provide the tools and flexibility colleagues need in how and where they do their work help colleagues feel connected to their work and why they do it make our processes efficient have a continuous improvement mindset and leverage best practices ensure managers actively engage with colleagues assess and reward colleagues and ensure colleagues are heard and valued 

our values new vision and refreshed purpose including our new brand in 2022 set the tone for what to expect at wtw and our ‘grow simplify and transform’ strategic priorities are supporting our focus on how to continually support and improve as appropriate our colleague experience we evaluate process efficiencies system upgrades and rewards offerings as well as the tradeoffs that may 

  

be required we further consider how we can work with flexibility in an ongoing hybrid model and fuel innovation among other things to continually attract engage and retain the most accomplished and aspiring talent 

headcount – our success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate the most accomplished and aspiring talent in the industry the number of employees by segment for the year ended december 31 2021 is approximated below 

   

i approximately 1400 colleagues provide region and account management and operational support for the hcb and crb segments and in prior year were allocated to those segments these colleagues have been included in corporate and other in 2021 consistent with our treatment of other shared resources 

the number of employees by geography as of the year ended december 31 2021 is approximated below 

 voluntary turnover excluding seasonal employees rolling 12month attrition was 152 in 2021 compared to 87 in 2020 the turnover rate for 2020 was abnormally low prec ovid19 attrition typically averaged around 120 the increase in attrition in 2021 compared to 2020 and 2019 was attributable in large part to both uncertainty associated with the planned combination with aon which was terminated in july and to a lesser extent generally increased movement in global talent markets the prolonged period of uncertainty introduced by the pending transaction and continuing in the period following the termination of that transaction drove attrition higher particularly in certain business units where job insecurity or other uncertainty was most elevated for example attrition in crb north america and europe was elevated because the perceived risk of business divestiture needed to secure regulatory approval was high additionally in corporate where dealrelated synergy savings were expected to be most concentrated colleagues sought employment elsewhere in order to avoid role redundancy 

hiring – hiring in 2021 increased significantly partly due to hiring in 2020 that was deferred due to the pandemic and business conditions and partly due to increased demand for our services hiring and internal movement for 2021 summarized below excludes seasonal colleagues in t ranzact and individual marketplace as the volumes are material and fluctuate significantly 

• hires increased 735 over 2020 to 7284 hiring growth was strong across all segments and geographies at yearend there were approximately 2800 open positions which is higher than historic rates but reflective of the sharp increase in new positions opened in the second half of the year 

• during 2021 139 of open positions were filled with internal candidates compared to 224 in 2020 the percentage drop being attributable to the significantly higher number of open positions in 2021 in addition promotions changes in levels and direct appointments into new roles brought additional opportunities for career growth and advancement 

• rehires represented 130 of total hires in 2021 

inclusion and diversity ‘id’ – we believe that when our individual talents are combined we unlock our collective potential we further believe that we are better together because each of us is different wtw aims to ensure that our values and id commitments are reflected in every interaction to support this we’re focusing on three key areas 

• attract and hire to grow our talent pipeline of colleagues from underrepresented communities 

• develop and promote to increase the overall diversity in business leadership 

• promote an inclusive culture that respects each other’s differences and celebrates what’s unique about each of us 

  

a key underlying theme of these priorities is a sharpened focus on our female talent and an aspirational goal to increase gender balance in leadership levels across the company this focus directly supports the statement we made when we joined the paradigm for parity® ‘p4p’ coalition in 2016 p4p is committed to reaching gender parity in leadership by 2030 

at december 31 2021 we had the following global female representation and in the us where we have the most complete data we had the following ethnic and racial diversity representation 

  

   

i other nonwhite includes american indian native hawaiian or other pacific islander and two or more races 

ii senior leadership represents about 5 of our colleagues and includes those with titles of managing and senior directors 

as of january 1 2022 three new independent directors joined our board of directors with a fourth new independent director to join on april 1 2022 this creates a further diverse board as selfidentified of which as of april 1 50 will be female including the compensation committee chair our new board as of that date will also have representation from the lgbt community and the black and asian communities and also has members with nonus citizenship including the audit and risk committee chair 

our executive officers have id objectives as part of their individual performance component comprising a portion of their shortterm incentive awards each year our leaders cascade id objectives throughout the organization and we continue to reinforce objective and fair processes that mitigate bias in all of our talent programs and processes examples of key activities include 

• our global id council sponsored by our ceo and by our chro sets the standard for our id initiatives globally it is driven by regional councils that provide local perspectives and help to translate our global priorities into actions within each region 

• our inclusion networks are designed to engage our talent and better connect us to each other our clients and the communities in which we work and live current inclusion networks include gender equity lgbt multicultural workability asia north america the uk and young professionals asia the uk western europe 

total rewards – we invest significant resources in our most important asset our colleagues we offer market competitive rewards packages comprising of a mix of base salary and incentives aligned to our payforperformance philosophy plus benefits that support health and wellbeing as well as the ability to plan for the future 

our total rewards programs align to our commitment to colleague health and wellbeing ensuring our people are protected in the event of accident or illness have sufficient paid time off and can accumulate capital for personal needs and retirement we also understand the need for flexibility in the modern workplace and provide modified work arrangements and schedules where practical eg flex time parttime workfromhome that enable and support colleagues to stay focused on their clients and business needs and balance their personal commitments 

covid19 response – in 2021 we continued to support the health and safety of colleagues by 

• monitoring and adapting both inoffice operations and returntooffice approaches for colleagues across our more than 140 countries prioritizing colleague health and safety as well as client service continuity while complying with all applicable local regulations 

• offering remote working solutions that address wellbeing potential travel athome office equipment provisioning collaboration tools and manager resources while also facilitating flexible worklife arrangements and support for home care requirements 

• monitoring colleague feedback on our response to the pandemic our november 2021 allcolleague pulse survey showed strong support for our efforts with over 90 of respondents feeling connected to their teams in an inclusive environment and able to effectively work in a hybrid work model 

  

• rethinking how colleagues work both independently and collaboratively now and in the future focusing on the evolving role our offices play the outcome of this work has been the development of a new work styles model that supports colleagues who are officebased homebased or a hybrid of the two for our hybrid colleagues we are extending a greater level of autonomy over where and how they do their work our belief is that colleagues know their work and the people tools and environment they need to be successful therefore to the extent that role geography andor any regulations allow how and where a colleague works will be determined by the work itself not arbitrary rules to simply be in the office 

the failure to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects for more information see part i item 1a risk factors of this form 10k

risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements these risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business the descriptions below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown to us could also impair our business operations financial condition or results if any of the risks and uncertainties below or other risks were to occur our business operations financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted with respect to the taxrelated consequences of acquisition ownership and disposal of ordinary shares you should consult with your own tax advisors 

strategic operational and technology risks 

our success largely depends on our ability to achieve our global business strategy as it evolves and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer if the company were unable to successfully establish and execute on its strategy and generate anticipated revenue growth and cost savings and efficiencies 

our future growth profitability and cash flows largely depend upon our ability to successfully establish and execute our global business strategy as discussed under item 1 ‘business  business strategy’ we seek to be an advisory broking and solutions provider of choice through an integrated global platform while we have confidence that our strategic plan reflects opportunities that are appropriate and achievable there is a possibility that our strategy may not deliver projected longterm growth in revenue and profitability due to inadequate execution incorrect assumptions global or local economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we operate suboptimal resource allocation or any of the other risks described in this ‘risk factors’ section in addition our strategy continues to evolve and it is possible that we will be unable to successfully execute the associated strategy changes due to factors discussed above or elsewhere in this ‘risk factors’ section in pursuit of our growth strategy we may also invest significant time and resources into new product or service offerings and there is the possibility that these offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment the failure to continually develop and execute optimally on our global business strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits of our growth strategy 

we have stated certain goals at our 2021 investor day and our outlook for the next several years including with respect to our cash flows our growth and margin targets and our share repurchases new initiatives aiming to implement such objectives pose potential operational risks and may result in distraction of management and employees we cannot be certain whether we will be able to realize benefits from current revenuegenerating or costsaving initiatives and ultimately realize our objectives there can be no assurance that our actual results will meet these financial goals 

we have been impacted by the covid19 pandemic and may be substantially and negatively impacted by it in the future 

the covid19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on global commercial activity including the global supply chain and at times has contributed to strain in financial markets including among other effects significant volatility in equity markets changes in interest rates and reduced liquidity on a global basis it has also resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdowns of businesses in various industries including among others travel trade tourism health systems and food supply and significantly reduced overall economic output as such there is a risk that covid19 and its variants could have a substantial negative impact on client demand and cash flow in certain or all of our businesses 

covid19 risks magnify other risks discussed in this report and any of our other sec filings for example the effectiveness of external parties including governmental and nongovernmental organizations in combating the spread and severity of covid19 and its variants could have a material impact on demand for our business in addition steps taken by market counterparties such as reinsurance carriers to limit their exposures to covid19 and related risks could have an impact on their willingness to provide or renew coverage for our clients on historical terms and pricing which could again impact demand for our business coverage disputes arising out of the pandemic some of which have already emerged could also increase our professional liability risk by increasing the frequency and severity of allegations by others that in the course of providing services we have committed errors or omissions for which we should have liability also travel restrictions have caused the postponement modification or cancellation of various conferences and meetings around the world and adversely impacted sales activity the rapid development and fluidity of the covid19 pandemic including the continued development availability distribution and acceptance of effective vaccines and the emergence of vaccineresistant variants precludes any prediction as to the duration of the covid19 pandemic and the ultimate adverse impact of covid19 on our business nevertheless covid19 continues to present material uncertainty and risk with respect to demand for our products and services 

in addition covid19 has disrupted certain aspects of our business and could continue to disrupt possibly materially our business operations and the services we provide as well as the business operations of our clients suppliers and other third parties with whom 

  

we interact as an increasing percentage of our colleagues continue to work remotely we face resiliency risks such as the risk that our information technology platform could potentially be inadequate to support increasing demand as well as the risk that unusual working arrangements could impact the effectiveness of our operations or controls economic disruption caused by covid19 or other factors may impact the pace at which we make information technologybased investments and we may continue to make fewer information technologybased investments than previously anticipated which could potentially create business operational risk in addition we depend on thirdparty platforms and other infrastructure to provide certain of our products and services and such thirdparty infrastructures face similar resiliency risks these factors have exposed us to increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks as cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic as well as an increase in the number of points of potential attack such as laptops and mobile devices both of which are now being used in increased numbers as many of our employees work remotely to be secured a failure to effectively manage these risks including to promptly identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks may adversely affect our business 

also a potential covid19 infection of any of our key colleagues could substantially and negatively impact our operations further it is possible that covid19 causes us to close down call centers and other processes on which we rely or impacts processes of thirdparty vendors on whom we rely which could also materially impact our operations resultant changes in financial markets could also have a material impact on our own hedging and other financial transactions which could impact our liquidity in addition it is possible that covid19 restrictions could create difficulty for satisfying our legal or regulatory filing or other obligations including with the sec and other regulators 

supply and labor market disruptions caused by covid19 as well as other factors such as accommodative monetary and fiscal policy have contributed to significant inflation in many of the markets in which we operate this impacts not only the costs to attract and retain employees but also other costs to run and invest in our business if our costs grow significantly in excess of our ability to raise revenues our margins and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives 

all of the foregoing events or potential outcomes including in combination with other risk factors included in this annual report on form 10k could cause a substantial negative effect on our results of operations in any period and depending on their severity could also substantially and negatively affect our financial condition furthermore such potential material adverse effects may lag behind the developments related to the covid19 pandemic such events and outcomes also could potentially impact our reputation with clients and regulators among others 

the sale of willis re to gallagher including transitional arrangements and pending transactions creates incremental business operational regulatory and reputational risks 

the completion of the agreedupon transaction to sell our willis re business to gallagher which has occurred in many but not all jurisdictions globally entails important risks including among others the risk that the postclosing transition arrangements which are complex may impose costs or liabilities or may give rise to errors in execution be distracting to our management or cause disruption to our business or our relationships with clients employees suppliers regulators and other third parties the risk that the triggers for the potential earnout payment may not be met the risk that transaction andor transition costs may be greater than expected including as a result of the complexity of the transition arrangements or conditions that regulators may put on any approvals of the transaction in jurisdictions that have not yet closed the potential impact of the consummation of the transaction and transition arrangements on relationships including with employees suppliers regulators clients competitors and other third parties the risk that management’s attention is diverted from other matters during the postclosing period and in the period prior to closing in jurisdictions where closing has yet to occur the risk that litigation associated with the gallagher transaction or with contingent liabilities we have retained if any arises the risk as described more below that we are unable to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or satisfy all of the other conditions required to consummate the gallagher transaction in remaining jurisdictions on the terms and expected schedule if at all the risk of disruptions from the completion of the gallagher transaction and transition arrangements that impact our business including current plans and operations including the risk of exacerbating existing disruptions or challenges we face and other risks in this annual report on form 10k and in our other sec filings 

demand for our services could decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn increased competition or a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or prospects all of which could materially adversely affect us 

we can give no assurance that the demand for our services will grow or be maintained or that we will compete successfully with our existing competitors new competitors or our clients’ internal capabilities client demand for our services may change based on the clients’ needs and financial conditions among other factors 

our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve for example any changes in us trade policy including any increases in tariffs that result in a trade war ongoing stock market volatility or an increase in or unmet market expectations with respect to interest rates could adversely affect the general economy as a result global financial markets may continue to experience disruptions 

  

including increased volatility and reduced credit availability which could substantially impact our results likewise covid19 and related economic disruption could have a material adverse impact on global demand from our clients in addition to the potential impact of pandemics on our own operations discussed elsewhere in this report while it is difficult to predict the consequences of any deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing our services or insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the potential for a significant insurer to fail be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenue and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients 

in addition the markets for our principal services are highly competitive our competitors include other insurance brokerage including directtoconsumer medicare brokerage human capital and risk management consulting and actuarial firms and the human capital and risk management divisions of diversified professional services insurance brokerage and accounting firms and specialty regional and local firms 

competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and some competitors have greater market share in certain lines of business than we do some of our competitors have greater financial technical and marketing resources than us which could enhance their ability to finance acquisitions fund internal growth and respond more quickly to professional and technological changes new competitors as well as increasing and evolving consolidation or alliances among existing competitors have created and could continue to create additional competition and could significantly reduce our market share resulting in a loss of business for us and a corresponding decline in revenue and profit margin in order to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure we may have to lower our prices which would also have an adverse effect on our revenue and profit margin 

in addition existing and new competitors whether traditional competitors or nontraditional competitors such as technology companies could develop competing technologies or product or service offerings that disrupt our industries any new technology or product or service offering including insurance companies selling their products directly to consumers or other insureds that reduces or eliminates the need for intermediaries in insurance sales transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further the increasing willingness of clients to either selfinsure or maintain a captive insurance company and the development of capital marketsbased solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance needs could also materially adversely affect us and our results of operations 

an example of a business that may be significantly impacted by changes in customer demand is our retirement consulting and actuarial business which comprises a substantial portion of our revenue and profit we provide clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans defined benefit pension plans generally require more actuarial services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools complex calculations to determine employer costs funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate or if we are unable to otherwise compensate for the decline in our business that results from employers moving away from defined benefit plans our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected furthermore large and complex consulting projects often involving dedicated personnel resources and expenses comprise a significant portion of this business which are based on our clients’ discretionary needs and may be reduced based on a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or prospects we also face the risk that certain large and complex project contracts may be reduced or terminated based on dissatisfaction with service levels which could result in reduced revenue writeoffs of assets associated with the project and disputes over the contract all of which may adversely impact our results and business 

in addition the demand for many of our core benefit services including compliancerelated services is affected by government regulation and taxation of employee benefit plans significant changes in tax or social welfare policy or other regulations could lead some employers to discontinue their employee benefit plans including defined benefit pension plans thereby reducing the demand for our services a simplification of regulations or tax policy also could reduce the need for our services 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational changes could impact our business results where the level of costs andor disruption may be significant and change over time and the benefits may be less than we originally expect 

we have in the past few years undergone several significant business and organizational changes including multiyear operational improvement programs and a new management structure among others there are also a number of other initiatives planned or ongoing to transform and update our systems and processes and gain efficiencies in addition our strategy continues to evolve and such evolution may result in further organizational changes or more or different investments than we currently anticipate in connection with all these changes we may manage a number of largescale and complex projects such projects may include multiple and connected phases many of which may be dependent on factors that are outside of our control while we plan to undertake these types of large complex projects based on our determination that each is necessary or desirable for the execution of the company’s 

  

business strategy we cannot guarantee that the collective effect of all of these projects will not adversely impact our business or results of operations or that the benefits will be as we originally expect effectively managing these organizational changes including ensuring that they are implemented on schedule within budget and without interruption to the existing business or that transitions to new systems do not create significant control vulnerabilities during the period of transition is critical to retaining talent servicing clients and our business success overall many of the risks described herein increase during periods of significant organizational change the failure to effectively manage such risks could adversely impact our resources or business or financial results 

changes in our management structure and in senior leadership could affect our business and financial results 

as of january 1 2022 carl hess succeeded john haley as our chief executive officer and previously announced changes to our management structure became effective additionally on september 7 2021 andrew krasner succeeded michael j burwell as our chief financial officer leadership transitions can be difficult to manage and may cause disruptions to our operations a leadership transition may also increase the likelihood of turnover among our employees and result in changes in our business strategy which may create uncertainty and negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy quickly and effectively leadership transitions may also impact our relationships with customers and other market participants and create uncertainty among investors employees and others concerning our future direction and performance any significant disruption uncertainty or change in business strategy could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

the loss of key colleagues or a large number of colleagues could damage or result in the loss of client relationships and could result in such colleagues competing against us 

our success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including key managers and colleagues in addition our success largely depends upon our colleagues’ abilities to generate business and provide quality services in particular our colleagues’ business relationships with our clients are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements labor markets have continued to tighten globally and we have experienced intense competition and increased costs for certain types of colleagues especially as new entrants in the insurance business among others expend significant resources in hiring also in the past and following the announcement and the termination of the proposed aon combination we have lost colleagues who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise if we lose additional colleagues such as those or if we lose a large number of other colleagues it could result in such colleagues competing against us voluntary attrition in a number of business lines remains elevated and it may take longer than expected to hire new colleagues to replace colleagues who have left andor these new colleagues may be subject to restrictive covenants that impact the amount of business they can generate while those covenants are in effect the failure to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel could materially adversely affect our ability to secure and complete engagements or could disrupt our business or cause increased operational risk which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

data security breaches or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could result in material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

we depend on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners insurance carriersmarkets clients and thirdparty vendors additionally one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their customers and employees our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks we are the target of computer viruses hackers distributed denial of service attacks malware infections ransomware attacks phishing and spearphishing campaigns andor other external hazards as well as improper or inadvertent workforce behavior which could expose confidential company and personal data systems and information to security breaches 

many of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from and supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors our thirdparty applications include but are not limited to enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services provided and maintained by thirdparty vendors these thirdparty applications store or may afford access to confidential and proprietary data of the company our employees and our clients we have processes designed to require thirdparty vendors that provide it outsourcing offsite storage and other services to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however this data is at risk of compromise or unauthorized access or use in the event of a breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent or as a result of a cyberattack on the product software or information systems of a vendor in our software supply chain any compromise of the product software data or infrastructure of a company vendor including a software or it vendor in our supply chain could in turn result in the compromise of company data or infrastructure or result in material operational disruption further the risk and potential impact of a data breach on our thirdparty vendors’ products software or systems increase as we move more of our data and our clients’ data into our vendors’ cloud storage engage in it outsourcing and consolidate the group of thirdparty vendors that provide cloud storage or other it services for the company over time the 

  

frequency severity and sophistication of the attacks against us and our vendors have increased including due to the use of artificial intelligence for purposes of cybercrime and the broader range of threat actors including statesponsored actors and hacker activists 

we and our vendors regularly experience cybersecurity incidents including successful attacks from time to time and we expect that to continue going forward cybersecurity incidents include those resulting from human error or malfeasance implantation of malware and viruses phishing and spearphishing attacks unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems and unauthorized access to data or individual account funds through fraud or other means of deceiving our colleagues clients thirdparty service providers and vendors we have experienced successful attacks by various types of hacking groups in which personal and commercially sensitive information belonging to the company or its clients has been compromised however none of these cybersecurity incidents or attacks to our knowledge have been material to our business or financial results we cannot assure that such cybersecurity incidents or attacks will not have a material impact on our business or financial results in the future when required by law we have notified individuals clients and relevant regulatory authorities such as insurancefinancial services regulators and privacy regulators of such cybersecurity incidents or attacks 

we maintain policies procedures and administrative physical and technological safeguards such as where in place multifactor authentication and encryption of data in transit and at rest designed to protect the security and privacy of the data in our custody and control however such safeguards are timeconsuming and expensive to deploy broadly and are not necessarily always in place or effective and we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of data security breaches improper access to takeover of or disclosure of confidential company or personally identifiable information we may not be able to detect and assess such issues or implement appropriate remediation in a timely manner we are engaged in an ongoing effort to enhance our protections against such attacks this effort will require significant expenditures and may not be successful our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we hold and protect it from theft computer viruses hackers or inadvertent loss 

if any person including any of our colleagues intentionally or unintentionally fails to comply with disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines regulatory enforcement andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client supplier or employee data whether through systems failure accident employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our colleagues or third parties could result in significant additional expenses including expenses relating to incident response and investigation remediation work notification of data security breaches and costs of credit monitoring services negative publicity operational disruption legal liability and damage to our reputation as well as require substantial resources and effort of management thereby diverting management’s focus and resources from business operations 

the methods used to obtain unauthorized access to disable or degrade service or sabotage the company’s systems are also constantly evolving are increasingly sophisticated and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for example the us federal bureau of investigation ‘fbi’ the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency and other us federal agencies continue to issue warnings about trends in cybercriminal and nationstate activity and other threats that are consistent with some of the types of incidents we have experienced to our knowledge these incidents have not had a material impact on our business or operations thus far however our reputation could be harmed and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we were to be the target of such attacks in the future or if despite our controls and efforts to detect breaches we were to be the victim of an undetected breach 

we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to and use of secured data and to prevent data loss the everevolving threats mean that we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate adapt enhance and otherwise improve our respective systems and processes especially as we grow our mobile cloud and other internetbased services there is no guarantee that such efforts will be adequate to safeguard against all fraud data security breaches unauthorized access operational impacts or misuses of data for example our policies employee training including phishing prevention training procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential personal or proprietary information by employees vendors or other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems in addition we may not be able to implement such efforts as quickly as desired if for example greater resources are required than originally expected or resources and management’s focus are insufficient any future significant compromise or breach of our data security or fraud whether external or internal or misuse of client colleague supplier or company data could result in additional significant costs lost revenue opportunities disruption of operations and service fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation with our clients and in the broader market  

from time to time we receive claims and are party to lawsuits arising from our work which could materially adversely affect our reputation business and financial condition 

we depend in large part on our relationships with clients and our reputation for highquality services to secure future engagements clients that become dissatisfied with our services may terminate their business relationships with us and clients and third parties that claim they suffered damages caused by our services may bring lawsuits against us we are subject to various actual and potential 

  

claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the provision of our services or the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims see note 15  commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k for examples of claims to which we are subject 

because we often assist our clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money and complex regulatory requirements including actuarial services asset management technology solutions development and implementation and the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may arise that allege our potential liability for all or part of the substantial amounts in question the nature of our work particularly our actuarial services necessarily involves the use of assumptions and the preparation of estimates relating to future and contingent events the actual outcome of which we cannot know in advance our actuarial and brokerage services also rely on substantial amounts of data provided by clients the accuracy and quality of which we may not be able to ensure in addition we could make computational software programming or data management errors in connection with the services we provide to clients 

clients may seek to hold us responsible for alleged errors or omissions relating to any of the brokerage advice and services we provide including when claims they submit to their insurance carriers are disputed or denied this risk is likely to be higher in circumstances such as claims related to covid19 some of which have already emerged where there are significant disputes between clients and insurance carriers over coverage and clients allege claims against us this risk also may be higher in circumstances where we have significant numbers of departures or new joiners or other disruptions to our business such as changes in ways of working given that many of our clients have very high insurance policy limits to cover their risks alleged errors and omissions claims against us arising from disputed or denied claims are often significant moreover in certain circumstances our brokerage investment and certain other types of business may not limit the maximum liability to which we may be exposed for claims involving alleged errors or omissions and as such we do not have limited liability for the work we provide to the associated clients 

further given that we frequently work with large pension funds and insurance companies as well as other large clients relatively small percentage errors or variances can create significant financial variances and result in significant claims for unintended or unfunded liabilities the risks from such variances or errors could be aggravated in an environment of declining pension fund asset values and insurance company capital levels in almost all cases our exposure to liability with respect to a particular engagement is substantially greater than the revenue opportunity that the engagement generates for us 

clients may seek to hold us responsible for the financial consequences of variances between assumptions and estimates and actual outcomes or for errors for example in the case of pension plan actuarial work a client’s claims might focus on the client’s alleged reliance on actuarial assumptions that it believes were unreasonable and based on such reliance the client made benefit commitments that it may later claim are not affordable or funding decisions that result in plan underfunding if and when actual outcomes vary from actuarial assumptions 

we also continue to create new products and services including increasingly complex technology solutions and to grow the business of providing products and services to institutional investors financial services companies and other clients the risk of claims from these lines of business and related products and services may be greater than from our core products or services and such claims may be for significant amounts as we take on increasingly complicated projects including those with complex regulatory requirements 

we also provide advice on both asset allocation and selection of investment managers increasingly for many clients we are responsible for making decisions on both of these matters or we may serve in a fiduciary capacity either of which may increase liability exposure in addition the company offers affiliated investment funds including in the us and ireland with plans to launch additional funds over time given that our investment business may recommend affiliated investment funds or affirmatively invest such clients’ assets in such funds under delegated authority this may increase our liability exposure we may also be liable for actions of managers or other service providers to the funds further for certain clients we are responsible for some portions of cash and investment management including rebalancing of investment portfolios and guidance to third parties on the structure of derivatives and securities transactions asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and investment managers may underperform their benchmarks in both cases the investment return shortfall can be significant clients experiencing this underperformance including from our affiliated investment funds may assert claims against us and such claims may be for significant amounts in addition our failure to properly execute our role can cause monetary damage to our clients or such third parties for which we might be found liable and such claims may be for significant amounts our expected expansion of this business geographically and in new offerings will subject us to additional contractual exposures and obligations with investors asset managers and third party service providers as well as increased regulatory exposures overall our ability to contractually limit our potential liability may be limited in certain jurisdictions or markets or in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary duties or other alleged errors or omissions 

the ultimate outcome of all of the above matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us in addition our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against such liabilities it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected by an 

  

unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the industries we operate in or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships in addition defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs 

as a highly regulated company we are subject from time to time to inquiries or investigations by governmental agencies or regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we have also been and may continue to be subject to inquiries and investigations by federal state or other governmental agencies regarding aspects of our clients’ businesses or our own businesses especially regulated businesses such as our insurance broker securities brokerdealer and investment advisory services such inquiries or investigations may consume significant management time and result in regulatory sanctions fines or other actions as well as significant legal fees which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and liquidity also we may face additional regulatory scrutiny as we expand our businesses geographically and in new products and services that we offer 

examples of these inquiries or investigations are set forth in more detail in note 15 — commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k these include various ongoing civil investigation proceedings in respect of alleged exchanges of commercially sensitive information among competitors in aviation and aerospace insurance and reinsurance broking 

all of these items reflect an increased focus by regulators in the uk us and elsewhere on various aspects of the operations and affairs of our regulated businesses we are unable to predict the outcome of these inquiries or investigations any proposed changes that result from these investigations and inquiries or any other investigations inquiries or regulatory developments or any potential fines or enforcement action could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions we face risks when we acquire or divest businesses and we could have difficulty in acquiring integrating or managing acquired businesses or with effecting internal reorganizations all of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation 

our growth depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions we may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms acceptable or favorable to us we also face additional risks related to acquisitions including that we could overpay for acquired businesses and that any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to our expectations in addition we may not repurchase as many of our outstanding shares as anticipated due to our acquisition activity or investment opportunities as well as other market or business conditions if we are unable to identify and successfully make integrate and manage acquisitions our business could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks related to divesting businesses including that we may not receive adequate consideration in return for the divested business we may continue to be subject to the liabilities of the divested business after its divestiture including with respect to work we might have performed on behalf of the divested business and we may not be able to reduce overhead or redeploy assets or retain colleagues after the divestiture closes for example we completed the sale of miller and the principal closing of the willis re business and are in the process of completing the remaining closings of our sale of the willis re business which may give rise to such risks including risks in managing transition arrangements 

in addition we cannot be certain that our acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or that our acquisitions or divestitures will otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if the operating performance of an acquired business deteriorates significantly we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

we may be unable to effectively integrate an acquired business into our organization and may not succeed in managing such acquired businesses or the larger company that results from such acquisitions the process of integrating an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks including without limitation an inability to retain the management key personnel and other employees of the acquired business an inability to establish uniform standards controls systems procedures and policies or to achieve anticipated savings and exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition 

with respect to any such acquisition transactions we face the risk related to the potential impacts of the transaction and integration on relationships including with employees correspondents suppliers clients and competitors as well as the risk related to contingent liabilities including litigation potentially creating material liabilities for the company the following risks in addition to those described above may also adversely affect our ability to successfully implement and integrate these acquisitions material changes in us and foreign jurisdiction regulations including those related to the healthcare system and medicare and insurance brokerage services changes in general economic business and political conditions in relevant markets including changes in the financial 

  

markets significant competition in the marketplace and compliance with extensive and evolving government regulations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 

if acquisitions are not successfully integrated and the intended benefits of the acquisitions are not achieved our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as well as our professional reputation we also own an interest in a number of associates and companies where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore limited in our ability to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we could achieve if we had full ownership 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic including prolonged effects of the covid19 pandemic security breach ransomware or destructive malware attack power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities access to data and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges with regard to our operations 

a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability particularly if any of these problems occur during peak times 

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing hardware or systems could cause material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant financial and other resources to maintain and enhance existing systems develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards we rely on being at the forefront of a range of technology options relevant to our business including by staying ahead of the technology offered by our competitors and attracting developing and retaining skilled individuals in the cybersecurity space the market for such qualified individuals is competitive and we may be unable to hire the necessary talent to mitigate the foregoing risks 

in addition many of the software applications including enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services that we use in our business are licensed from and supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors we are significantly increasing our use of such cloud services and expect this to continue over time these thirdparty applications store confidential and proprietary data of the company our clients and our employees a suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruptions that could adversely impact our business as a global organization we occasionally acquire other companies or divest certain of our existing business lines and companies these strategic business decisions may require us to manage complex integrations or dissolutions of information systems or the transfer of information from one system to another and we may fail to identify vulnerabilities in our targets’ information systems or in integrated components of our respective information systems these transactions may make us more susceptible to cyberattacks and could result in the theft of company intellectual property the compromise of company employee and client data or operational disruption 

any finding that the data we rely on to run our business is inaccurate or unreliable that we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer hardware applications or software systems or the loss of skilled people with the knowledge needed to operate older systems or that we experience cost overruns delays or other disruptions could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability 

the united kingdom’s exit from the european union which occurred on january 31 2020 and the risk that other countries may follow could adversely affect us 

in 2021 approximately 18 of our revenue from continuing operations was generated in the uk although only about 12 of revenue from continuing operations was denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 18 of our expenses from continuing operations were denominated in pounds sterling it remains difficult to predict with any level of certainty the impact that brexit will have on the economy economic regulatory and political stability and market conditions in europe including in the uk or on the pound sterling euro or other european currencies but any such impacts and others we cannot currently anticipate could materially adversely affect us and our operations among other things we could experience lower growth in the region due to indecision by businesses holding off on generating new projects or due to adverse market conditions and reduced reported revenue and earnings because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars due to 

  

the fact that we translate revenue denominated in nonus currencies such as pounds sterling into us dollars for our financial statements in addition there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective 

on december 24 2020 the eu and the uk agreed to the terms of a trade and cooperation agreement the ‘tca’ that reflects certain matters agreed upon between the parties in relation to a broad range of separation issues which provisionally applied as of january 1 2021 and entered into force on may 1 2021 while many separation issues have been resolved some uncertainty remains in relation to the future regulation of financial services among other matters the tca addresses issues related to financial services on a limited basis the eu and the uk have separately agreed to a memorandum of understanding to establish a framework for future regulatory cooperation the british government and the eu will therefore continue over time to negotiate certain terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu that are not addressed in the tca the company is heavily invested in the uk through our businesses and activities if the outcomes of brexit and the tca negatively impact the uk then it could have a material adverse impact on us brexit has resulted in greater restrictions on business conducted between the uk and eu countries and has increased regulatory complexities there also remains uncertainty as to how changes to the uk’s access to the eu single market and the wider trading legal regulatory tax social and labor environments especially in the uk and eu will be impacted over time including the resulting impacts on our business and that of our clients these changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results for example a loss of prebrexit passporting rights or other changed regulations relating to doing business in various eu countries by relying on a regulatory permission in the uk or doing business in the uk by relying on a regulatory permission in an eu country may over time increase our costs of doing business or our ability to do so and thereby adversely impact our operations and financial results 

we believe we have implemented appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business in the countries most affected these arrangements include the transaction of certain businesses andor the movement of certain businesses outside of the uk however various significant risks remain in relation to the effects of the postbrexit arrangements between the eu and uk some of which have yet to be agreed upon including the following among others 

• the risk that our implemented business solutions could cost more than expected or that regulators in the uk or eu may issue amended guidance or regulations in relation to those solutions or that we fail to gain regulatory authorizations which could affect our business operations or strategic plans 

• the risk that we may require further changes to client contract terms and have to address additional regulatory requirements including with respect to data protection and privacy standards 

• the risk over time of a loss of key talent or an inability to hire sufficient and qualified talent or the disruption due to client servicing as a result of equivalence not being granted on qualifications 

• the risk that the efforts and resources allocated to the postbrexit evolution of regulations and laws and associated changes to our operations cause disruptions to our existing businesses whether inside or outside the uk or both 

• the risk that the uk will continue to have in place a limited number of trade agreements with the eu member states andor any noneu states leading to potentially adverse trading conditions with other territories and 

• the risk that the way in which the ukeu regulatory and legal environment evolves differs from current expectations resulting in the need to quickly and materially change our plans and the risks described above with respect to any associated changes in such plans 

there is also a risk that other countries may decide to leave the eu we cannot predict the impact that any additional countries leaving the eu will have on us but any such impacts could materially adversely affect us 

allegations of conflicts of interest including in connection with accepting market derived income ‘mdi’ may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or reputation 

we could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest conflicts of interest exist or could exist any time the company or any of its employees have or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests this could occur for example when the company is providing services to multiple parties in connection with a transaction in addition as we provide more solutionsbased services there is greater potential for conflicts with advisory services managing conflicts of interest is an important issue for the company but can be a challenge for a large and complex company such as ours due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base we regularly address potential conflicts of interest including without limitation situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client if these are not carefully managed this could then lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests with attendant regulatory and reputational risks that could materially adversely affect us and our operations there is no guarantee that all potential conflicts of interest will be identified and undetected 

  

conflicts may result in damage to our professional reputation and result in legal liability which may have a material adverse effect on our business identifying conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult as we continue to bring systems and information together and integrate newly acquired businesses in addition we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest 

in addition insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of placements we make for clients or by fees paid by clients intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers this revenue when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets as opposed to as corporate clients of the intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other nonmarketrelated services is commonly known as market derived income or ‘mdi’ mdi is another example of an area in which allegations of conflicts of interest may arise mdi takes a variety of forms including volume or profitbased contingent commissions facilities administration charges business development agreements and fees for providing certain data to carriers 

mdi creates various risks intermediaries in many markets have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ or their own interests ahead of their clients accordingly mdi may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest antitrust unfair competition conduct and antibribery laws and regulations while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice and while we have established systems and controls to manage these risks we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be effective 

in addition the company offers affiliated investment funds with plans to launch additional funds over time given that our investment business may recommend affiliated investment funds or affirmatively invest such clients’ assets in such funds under delegated authority there may be a perceived conflict of interest while the company has processes procedures and controls in place intended to mitigate potential conflicts such perception could cause regulatory inquiries or could impact client demand and the business’ financial performance and our controls may not be effective in addition underperformance by our affiliated investment funds could lead to lawsuits by clients that were invested in such funds 

the failure or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions conflicts of interest may also arise in the future that could cause material harm to us 

damage to our reputation including due to the failure of third parties on whom we rely to perform services or public opinions of third parties with whom we associate could adversely affect our businesses 

maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with clients and colleagues damage to our reputation could therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory action failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures allegations of conflicts of interest and unethical behavior such harm could also arise from negative public opinion or political conditions arising from our association with third parties in any number of activities or circumstances negative perceptions or publicity whether or not true may result in harm to our prospects in addition the failure to deliver satisfactory service and quality performance on time and within budget in one line of business could cause clients to terminate the services we provide to those clients in many other lines of business this risk has increased as the company has become larger and more complex and as we take on increasingly complicated projects for our clients such as complex outsourcing engagements and technology solutions developmentimplementation projects that require a significant amount of dedicated personnel resources and expenses 

in addition as part of providing services to clients and managing our business we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers our ability to perform effectively depends in part on the ability of these service providers to meet their obligations as well as on our effective oversight of their performance the quality of our services could suffer or we could be required to incur unanticipated costs if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as expected or their services are disrupted this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation as well as our business and results of operations 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology data and analytics to drive value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology analytics and related tools 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology data and analytic solutions that anticipate lead or keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology both for internal operations and for maintaining industry standards and meeting client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely and costeffective manner or in attracting and maintaining personnel with the necessary skills in this area additionally our ideas may not lead to the desired internal efficiencies or be accepted in the marketplace in addition we may not be able to implement technologybased solutions as quickly as desired if for example greater resources are required than originally expected or resources are otherwise needed elsewhere the effort to gain technological and data expertise and develop new technologies or analytic techniques in our business requires us to incur significant cost and attract qualified technical talent who are in high demand our competitors are seeking 

  

to develop competing or new technologies and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions in certain cases we may decide based on perceived business needs to make investments that may be greater than we currently anticipate if we cannot offer new technologies or data and analytic services or solutions as quickly or effectively as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or analytic tools it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements 

our business may be harmed by any negative developments that may occur in the insurance industry or if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers 

many of our businesses are heavily dependent on the insurance industry any negative developments that occur in the insurance industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations in addition if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers it may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the private health insurance industry in the us has experienced a substantial amount of consolidation over the past several years resulting in a decrease in the number of insurance carriers in the future it may become necessary for us to offer insurance plans from a reduced number of insurance carriers or to derive a greater portion of our revenue from a more concentrated number of carriers as our business and the health insurance industry continue to evolve the termination amendment or consolidation of our relationships with our insurance carriers could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

legal nonfinancialtax regulatory and compliance risks 

our inability to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations related to data privacy and cyber security could result in material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the us and foreign jurisdictions only certain of which are named here designed to protect the personally identifiable information of client and company constituents and suppliers notably the european union’s general data protection regulation ‘gdpr’ and the california consumer privacy act and its implementing regulations ‘ccpa’ we are also subject to regulations from other countries that prohibit or restrict the transmission of data outside of such countries’ borders and to various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health financial or other individually identifiable information the gdpr which became effective in may 2018 as well as other more recentlyenacted privacy laws significantly increased our responsibilities when handling personal data including without limitation requiring us to conduct privacy impact assessments restricting the transmission of data and requiring public disclosure of significant data breaches violations of the gdpr may result in possible fines of up to 4 of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million whichever is higher a july 2020 judgment by the court of justice of the european union on schrems ii has made cross border data transfers to organizations outside the european economic area more onerous and uncertain pending definitive guidance by european union authorities further as a result of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union ‘brexit’ the data transfer regime between the uk and the european economic area is subject to some uncertainty if the uk’s data strategy diverges from the eu’s in the coming years the company is also subject to numerous us and foreign marketing and telecommunications laws and regulations designed to protect consumers from unwanted or fraudulent communications a violation of any such law may lead to litigation or regulatory liability including substantial financial damages or fines 

laws and regulations in this area are evolving and generally becoming more stringent including without limitation the us health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ‘hipaa’ enforced by the office for civil rights within the department of health and human services and the new york state department of financial services’ cybersecurity regulations outlining required security measures for the protection of data certain us states have also recently enacted laws requiring certain data security and privacy measures of regulated entities notably the ccpa we expect that both other us states and other countries will follow in implementing their own data privacy and data security laws for example brazil recently enacted the lei geral de proteção de dados pessoais a national data protection law modeled on the gdpr the people’s republic of china and india among other countries are also expected to enact data protection laws that could among other things restrict data transfers out of each of those countries 

each of these evolving laws and regulations in the united states and abroad as well as laws applicable to the company that are not named here may be subject to evolving and conflicting interpretations restrict the manner in which we provide services to our clients divert resources from other important initiatives increase the risk of noncompliance impose significant compliance and other costs that are likely to increase over time and increase the risk of fines lawsuits or other potential liability all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our failure to adhere to or successfully develop processes in response to legal or regulatory requirements including legal or regulatory requirements that may be developed or revised due to economic or geopolitical changes such as brexit and changing customer expectations in this area could result in substantial legal liability and impairment to our reputation or business 

  

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal regulatory cultural market operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries 

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal regulatory market operational and other risks our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets the possible effects of political economic financial and climate change related disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses and financial results these risks include 

• the general economic and political conditions in the us and foreign countries including political and social unrest in certain regions 

• the imposition of controls or limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries 

• the imposition of sanctions by both the us and foreign governments 

• the imposition of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments from subsidiaries 

• the imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates or our tax rates 

• difficulties in controlling operations and monitoring employees in geographically dispersed and culturally diverse locations and 

• the practical challenges and costs of complying or monitoring compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws some of which are evolving or are not as welldeveloped as the laws of the us or uk or which may conflict with us or other sources of law and regulations applicable to insurance brokers and other business operations abroad in more than 140 countries including many in emerging markets including laws rules and regulations relating to the conduct of business trade sanction laws administered by the us office of foreign assets control the eu the uk and the united nations ‘un’ and the requirements of the us foreign corrupt practices act as well as other antibribery and corruption rules and requirements in all of the countries in which we operate 

sanctions imposed by governments or changes to such sanction regulations such as sanctions imposed on russia and related countersanctions could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial results 

as described above our businesses are subject to the risk of sanctions imposed by the us the eu the uk and other governments in the past year there was an increase in us designations in relation to russia and china including recent sanctions imposed on russia by the us as well as the eu and uk due to ukraine and there has also been an increased risk of countersanctions in some locations such as china and russia in response to the recently imposed sanctions we have also seen a maturing of the uk sanctions regime which has navigated a differing path from the eu and us sanctions regimes but largely with the same objectives a number of volatile geopolitical events are likely to affect the implementation of sanctions such as the change of regime in afghanistan the escalation of sanctions towards belarus russias invasion of ukraine the uncertainty around the nord stream 2 pipeline negotiations between the eu us and iran over a new nuclear deal as well as the continuing trade war between the us and china with their sanctions and subsequent countersanctions some of these jurisdictions such as china or russia may be significant businesses for us as a result we cannot predict the impacts of any changes in the us eu uk or other sanctions and whether such changes could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial results 

our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government laws or regulations or if government laws or regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs 

a material portion of our revenue is affected by statutory or regulatory changes an example of a statutory or regulatory change that could materially impact us is any change to the us patient protection and affordable care act ‘ppaca’ and the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 ‘hcera’ which we refer to collectively as ‘healthcare reform’ while the us congress has not passed legislation replacing or fundamentally amending healthcare reform other than changes to the individual mandate such legislation or another version of healthcare reform could be implemented in the future in addition some us political candidates and representatives elected to office in the recent election have expressed a desire to amend all or a portion of healthcare reform or otherwise establish alternatives to employersponsored health insurance or replace it with governmentsponsored health insurance often referred to as ‘medicare for all’ furthermore various aspects of healthcare reform have been challenged in the judicial system with some success the status of some of those challenges are in flux but could materially change us healthcare if we are unable to adapt our services to potential new laws and regulations or judicial modifications with respect to healthcare reform or otherwise our ability to provide effective services in these areas may be substantially impacted in addition more restrictive rules or interpretations of the centers for medicare and medicaid services marketing rules or judicial decisions that restrict or otherwise 

  

change existing provisions of us healthcare regulation could have a material adverse impact on our healthcarerelated businesses in addition as we implement and expand our directtoconsumer sales and marketing solutions we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations that prescribe when and how we may market to consumers including without limitation the telephone consumer protection act and other telemarketing laws and the medicare communications and marketing guidelines issued by the center for medicare services of the us department of health and human service changes to these laws could negatively affect our ability to market directly to consumers or increase our costs or liabilities 

many other areas in which we provide services are the subject of government regulation which is constantly evolving for example our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services are subject to regulation and supervision by national state or other authorities insurance laws in the markets in which we operate are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the markets in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these locations 

changes in government and accounting regulations in the us and the uk two of our principal geographic markets affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human capital programs may materially adversely affect the demand for or the profitability of our various services in addition we have significant operations throughout the world which further subject us to applicable laws and regulations of countries outside the us and the uk changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators in particular countries including changes in administration and enforcement policies could require operational improvements or modifications which may result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business in those countries 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we comply with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the us the uk the eu and its member states and the other jurisdictions around the world in which we operate in addition we own an interest in a number of associates and companies where we do not exercise management control over the last few years regulators across the world are increasingly seeking to regulate brokers who operate in their jurisdictions the foreign and us laws and regulations applicable to our operations are complex continually evolving and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings these laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations antitrust and competition laws economic and trade sanctions laws relating to countries in which certain subsidiaries do business or may do business ‘sanctioned jurisdictions’ such as crimea cuba iran russia sudan syria and venezuela anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act 2010 and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us as well as laws and regulations related to data privacy cyber security and telemarketing because of changes in regulation and company practice our nonus subsidiaries are providing more services with connections to various countries including some sanctioned jurisdictions that our us subsidiaries are unable to perform 

in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies monetary fines injunctions revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients while we believe that we have substantially increased our focus on the geographic breadth of regulations to which we are subject maintain good relationships with our key regulators and our current systems and controls are adequate we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of any applicable laws and regulations while we strive to remain fully compliant with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot guarantee that we will fully comply at all times with all laws and regulations especially in countries with developing or evolving legal systems or with evolving or extraterritorial regulations in particular given the challenges of integrating operations many of which are decentralized we cannot assure that acquired or decentralized entities’ business systems and controls have prevented or will prevent any and all violations of applicable laws or regulations 

changes and developments in the health insurance system in the united states could harm our business 

in 2010 the federal government enacted significant reforms to healthcare legislation through healthcare reform many of our lines of business depend upon the private sector of the us insurance system its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use of and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance plans healthcare reform provisions have changed and will continue to change the industry in which we operate in substantial ways any changes to the roles of the private and public sectors in the health insurance system could also substantially change the industry 

  

healthcare legislation and changes to governmentfunded healthcare programs remain a focus in congress while various aspects of healthcare reform have been challenged in the judicial system with some success any partial or complete repeal or amendment judicial modifications or implementation difficulties or uncertainty regarding such events could increase our costs of compliance prevent or delay future adoption or revisions to our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition other members of congress and certain state governments have expressed a desire to establish alternatives to employersponsored health insurance or replace it with governmentsponsored health insurance often referred to as ‘medicare for all’ given the uncertainties relating to the potential repeal and replacement of healthcare reform or other alternative proposals related to health insurance plans the impact is difficult to determine but it could have material negative effects on us including 

• increasing our competition 

• reducing or eliminating the need for health insurance agents and brokers or demand for the health insurance that we sell 

• decreasing the number of types of health insurance plans that we sell as well as the number of insurance carriers offering such plans 

• causing insurance carriers to change the benefits andor premiums for the plans they sell 

• causing insurance carriers to reduce the amount they pay for our services or change our relationship with them in other ways or 

• materially restricting our call center operations 

any of these effects could materially harm our business and results of operations for example various aspects of healthcare reform could cause insurance carriers to limit the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell and the geographies in which we are able to sell them in addition the us congress may seek to find spending cuts and such cuts may include medicare if cuts are made to medicare there may be substantial changes in the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell especially through our individual marketplace business which focuses on directtoconsumer medicare policy sales changes in the law could also cause insurance carriers to exit the business of selling insurance plans in a particular jurisdiction to eliminate certain categories of products or to attempt to move members into new plans for which we receive lower commissions if insurance carriers decide to limit our ability to sell their plans or determine not to sell individual health insurance plans altogether our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed 

limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and our ability to compete effectively and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 

we cannot guarantee that trade secret trademark and copyright law protections or our internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property including our software which may become an increasingly important part of our business existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights also we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot be sure that our services and products or the products of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients these claims may harm our reputation result in financial liability consume financial resources to pursue or defend and prevent us from offering some services or products in addition these claims whether with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s focus and resources from business operations successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

the laws of ireland differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the 

  

company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

financial and related regulatory including tax risks 

we have material pension liabilities that can fluctuate significantly and adversely affect our financial position or net income or result in other financial impacts 

we have material pension liabilities some of which represent unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement liabilities movements in the interest rate environment investment returns inflation or changes in other assumptions that are used to estimate our benefit obligations and other factors could have a material effect on the level of liabilities in these plans at any given time most pension plans have minimum funding requirements that may require material amounts of periodic additional funding and accounting requirements that may result in increased pension expense for example in 2018 we were required to recognize a £ 31 million 40 million pension settlement expense related to the accelerated recognition of certain accumulated losses in one of our uk pension schemes following the transfer out of assets of certain plan participants depending on the above factors among others we could be required to recognize further pension expense in the future increased pension expense could adversely affect our earnings or cause earnings volatility in addition the need to make additional cash contributions may reduce our financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or other needs of our business 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility and we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 

wtw had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 46 billion as of december 31 2021 and our interest expense was 211 million for the year ended december 31 2021 

although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may 

• require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures to pursue other acquisitions or investments to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes or challenges relating to our business and industry and 

• put us at a competitive disadvantage against competitors who have less indebtedness or are in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources 

the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments the operating restrictions and financial covenants in our credit facilities do and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default or a crossdefault under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that is not cured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the maintenance and growth of our business depends on our access to capital which will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing also we could be at risk to rising interest rates in the future to the extent that we borrow at floating rates under our existing borrowing agreements or refinance existing debt at higher rates there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

a downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility and under certain circumstances may require us to offer to buy back some of our outstanding debt 

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources 

in addition under the indentures for our 3600 senior notes due 2024 our 4625 senior notes due 2023 our 6125 senior notes due 2043 our 4400 senior notes due 2026 our 2125 senior notes due 2022 our 4500 senior notes due 2028 our 5050 senior notes due 2048 our 2950 senior notes due 2029 and our 3875 senior notes due 2049 if we experience a ratings decline together with a change of control event we would be required to offer to purchase these notes from holders unless we had previously redeemed those notes we may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

if a us person is treated as owning at least 10 of our shares such a holder may be subject to adverse us federal income tax consequences 

under current us federal tax law many of our nonus subsidiaries are now classified as ‘controlled foreign corporations’ ‘cfcs’ for us federal income tax purposes due to the expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules within a multinational corporate group if a us person is treated as owning directly indirectly or constructively at least 10 of the value or voting power of our shares such a person may be treated as a us shareholder with respect to one or more of our cfc subsidiaries in addition if our shares are treated as owned more than 50 by us shareholders we would be treated as a cfc a us shareholder of a cfc may be required to annually report and include in its us taxable income as ordinary income its prorata share of subpart f income global intangible lowtaxed income and investments in us property by cfcs whether or not we make any distributions to such us shareholder an individual us shareholder generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a corporate us shareholder with respect to a cfc a failure by a us shareholder to comply with its reporting obligations may subject the us shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may extend the statute of limitations with respect to the us shareholder’s us federal income tax return for the year for which such reporting was due we cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our nonus subsidiaries are cfcs or whether any investor is a us shareholder with respect to any such cfcs we also cannot guarantee that we will furnish to us shareholders any or all of the information that may be necessary for them to comply with the aforementioned obligations us investors should consult their own advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments in us 

legislative or regulatory action or developments in case law in the us or elsewhere could have a material adverse impact on our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from expectations and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future there may be an enactment of additional or the revision of existing state federal andor foreign regulatory and tax laws andor a development of case law as well as regulations and policy changes in the us or abroad any such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

further it is possible that significant changes to the us tax policies may be proposed and legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely or otherwise affect the taxes that the us imposes on our worldwide operations regulations or administrative guidance from the us treasury department that are currently proposed or newly issued in the future could have similar consequences such changes could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant additional expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that have the effect of limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise experience business detriment 

in addition the us congress the organization for economic cooperation and development ‘oecd’ the world trade organization and other government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of base erosion and profit shifting where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates several jurisdictions have enacted legislation that is aligned with and in some cases exceeds the scope of the recommendations in the oecd’s 2015 reports addressing 15 specific actions as part of a comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting on october 8 2021 the oecd announced an international agreement with more than 130 countries to implement a global minimum effective corporate tax rate of 15 for certain large multinational companies starting in 

  

2023 the agreement also introduced rules that would result in the reallocation of certain taxing rights from multinational companies from their home countries to the markets where they have business activities and earn profits regardless of physical presence and could impact certain tax measures in the european union as a result the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various other risks that could impact our business 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside of the us accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or us dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws additionally and as noted above the unknown impacts of brexit may expose us to additional exchange rate fluctuations in the pounds sterling 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside of the us and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in local currencies 

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenue and expenses together with any net pounds sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollardenominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure while we do utilize hedging strategies to attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective 

changes in accounting principles or in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us gaap any change to accounting principles particularly to us gaap could have a material adverse effect on us or our results of operations 

us gaap accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to revenue recognition valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients discretionary compensation incurredbutnotreported liabilities restructuring pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates and changes in accounting standards could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

in addition we have a substantial amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

our quarterly revenue and cash flow could fluctuate including as a result of factors outside of our control while our expenses may remain relatively fixed or be higher than expected 

quarterly variations in our revenue cash flow and results of operations have occurred in the past and could occur as a result of a number of factors such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter seasonality of certain types of services the number of business days in a quarter colleague hiring and utilization rates our clients’ ability to terminate engagements without penalty the size and scope of assignments our ability to enhance our billing collection and working capital management efforts differences in timing of renewals nonrecurring revenue from disposals and bookofbusiness sales and general economic conditions 

  

we derive significant revenue from commissions for brokerage services but do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in the premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission levels may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenue and operating margin we could be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions in addition insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as us the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

a sizeable portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed or may even be higher than expected encompassing the majority of administrative occupancy communications and other expenses depreciation and amortization and salaries and employee benefits excluding fiscal yearend incentive bonuses therefore a variation in the number of client assignments and collection of accounts receivable or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments or our inability to forecast demand can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results and could result in losses and volatility in our stock price 

increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors clients and our colleagues with respect to our environmental social and governance ‘esg’ practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks 

 

there is increased focus including from governmental organizations investors colleagues and clients on esg issues such as environmental stewardship climate change diversity and inclusion racial justice and workplace conduct negative public perception adverse publicity or negative comments in social media and other forums could damage our reputation if we do not or are not perceived to adequately address any one or more of these issues any harm to our reputation could impact colleague engagement and retention and the willingness of clients and others to do business with us 

 

investors in particular have increased their emphasis on the esg practices of companies across all industries including with respect to climate and human capital management certain investors have developed their own esg ratings while others use thirdparty benchmarks or scores to measure a company’s esg practices and make investment decisions or otherwise engage with the company to influence its practices in these areas additionally our clients may evaluate our esg practices andor request that we adopt certain esg policies in order to work with us also organizations that provide ratings information to certain investors on esg matters may assign unfavorable ratings to the company which may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment capital to other companies or industries which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our costs of capital 

 

new government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of esg oversight and new mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure as we work to align with the recommendations of the financial stability board’s task force on climaterelated financial disclosures the sustainability accounting standards board and our own esg assessments and priorities we may disclose additional metrics against which we may measure ourselves or be measured and tracked by others over time our failure to meet expectations of metrics whether expectations set by us or by investors or other stakeholders or to any other failure to make progress in this area on a timely basis or at all may negatively impact our reputation and our business 

  

it is unclear how increased regulatory oversight and changes in the method for determining as well as the anticipated discontinuation of the london interbank offered rate ‘libor’ may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to libor or how such changes could affect our results of operations or financial condition 

in the recent past concerns have been publicized regarding the calculation of libor the london interbank offered rate which present risks for the financial instruments that use libor as a reference rate libor has been the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the london interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally on march 5 2021 libor’s regulator the financial conduct authority and administrator ice benchmark administration limited announced that the publication of the oneweek and twomonth usd libor maturities and nonusd libor maturities will cease immediately after december 31 2021 with the remaining usd libor maturities ceasing immediately after june 30 2023 accordingly uncertainty as to the nature of such changes may affect the market for or pricing of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations in addition any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor which could have an impact on the market for or pricing of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us including our revolving credit facility or on our overall financial condition or results of operations for example on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 currently there is not an agreement on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor however the alternative reference rate committee in the us comprised of a group of large banks and other financial institutions selected the secured overnight finance rate ‘sofr’ as an alternative to libor in may 2018 the federal reserve bank of new york began to publish the alternative rate sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by treasury securities furthermore as of april 23 2018 the bank of england has commenced publication of a reformed sterling overnight index average ‘sonia’ comprised of a broader set of overnight sterling money market transactions the sonia has been recommended as the alternative to sterling libor by the uk working group on sterling riskfree reference rates 

the company has incorporated provisions for the use of successor benchmarks where required in all of its external borrowing facilities that provide for floatingrate borrowing including our recently amended and restated 15 billion revolving credit facility additionally where the company engages in floatingrate intercompany lending we have made arrangements to benchmark the borrowing off successor market rates to maintain armslength pricing while we do not expect that the transition from libor and risks related thereto will have a material adverse impact on our financing costs it is still uncertain at this time 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders for repurchasing shares of common stock and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries for example willis limited our uk brokerage subsidiary regulated by the fca is currently required to maintain 140 million in unencumbered and available financial resources of which at least 83 million must be in cash for regulatory purposes in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on or repurchase shares of common stock in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate

share data 

our ordinary shares trade on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol ‘wtw’ as of january 10 2022 our ordinary shares previously traded under the symbol ‘wltw’ starting on january 5 2016 as of february 18 2022 there were 1118 shareholders of record of our shares 

dividends 

we normally pay dividends on a quarterly basis to shareholders of record on march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 in february 2022 the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 082 per share 328 per share annualized rate which will be paid on or around april 15 2022 to shareholders of record as of march 31 2022 

there are no governmental laws decrees or regulations in ireland that restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to nonresident holders of the company’s shares 

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the united states should be exempt from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from irish dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends 

with respect to noncorporate us shareholders certain dividends from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradeable on an established securities market in the united states such as our shares noncorporate us shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as investment income pursuant to section 163d4 of the code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation in addition the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances

executive overview 

market conditions 

typically our business benefits from regulatory change political risk or economic uncertainty insurance broking generally tracks the economy but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty we have some businesses such as our health and benefits and administration businesses which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change 

within our insurance and brokerage business due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission revenue may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating margin a ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our revenue and operating margin rates however vary by geography industry and client segment as a result and due to the global and diverse nature of our business we view rates in the aggregate overall we are currently seeing a modest but definite increase in pricing in the market 

market conditions in the broking industry in which we operate are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world insurance rate movements and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients 

the markets for our consulting technology and solutions and marketplace services are affected by economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors we believe that the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs in that regard we are focused on developing and implementing technology data and analytic solutions for both internal operations and for maintaining industry standards and meeting client preferences we have made such investments from time to time and may decide based on perceived business needs to make investments in the future that may be different from past practice or what we currently anticipate 

with regard to the market for exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform part of the employersponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase as these market segments continue to evolve we may experience growth in intervals with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth in recent years growth in the market for exchanges has slowed and we expect this trend may continue 

from time to time including but not limited to the period after the announcement of the proposed aon combination through the period that has followed the termination of the proposed combination we have lost and may in the future continue to lose colleagues who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise when we lose colleagues such as those it often results in such colleagues competing against us further the full impact of this competition may be delayed due to the timing of restrictive covenants or client renewals we believe that this dynamic which was most pronounced in our corporate risk and broking 

  

segment in the second and third quarters of 2021 has caused the segment’s nearterm growth rates in the fourth quarter and expected into 2022 to be meaningfully slower than other competitors this dynamic may be difficult to predict given that the adverse impact in future periods is more significant than in the periods in which employees departed growth may also be adversely affected by the fact that 2021 performance in a number of businesses particularly commercial risk broking and health  benefits broking benefited from revenue from book sales which is nonrepeatable revenue it is possible that growth could be different than expected and our results of operations could be significantly and adversely impacted 

see part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k for discussions of risks that may affect our ability to compete 

brexit 

following the occurrence of brexit and the end of the formal transition period on december 31 2020 a trade agreement has been established between the uk and eu as expected the agreement largely addressed goods and not services and the company has therefore completed the establishment of appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business in all relevant eu countries further negotiations between the uk and eu resulted in the agreement of a memorandum of understanding to address matters related to financial services though the outcome of future engagement between the uk and eu in relation to services including financial services and potential impact on the company are not yet fully known for a further discussion of the risks of brexit to the company see part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

although approximately 18 of our revenue from continuing operations is generated in the uk on an annual basis about 12 of revenue from continuing operations is denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 18 of our expenses from continuing operations is denominated in pounds sterling thus we generally benefit from a weakening pound sterling in our income from continuing operations however we have a company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency 

risks and uncertainties of the covid19 pandemic and the related economic environment 

the covid19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on global commercial activity particularly on the global supply chain and workforce availability and has contributed to significant volatility in the global financial markets including among other effects occasional declines in the equity markets changes in interest rates and reduced liquidity on a global basis with regard to the effects on our own business operations and those of our clients suppliers and other third parties with whom we interact the company has regularly considered the impact of covid19 and the wider economic results on our business taking into account our business resilience and continuity plans financial modeling and stress testing of liquidity and financial resources 

over the last two years the covid19 pandemic generally did not have a material adverse impact on our overall financial results initially the pandemic had a negative impact on our revenue growth primarily in our businesses that are discretionary in nature however we later saw an increased demand for these services which improved revenue growth beginning in the second quarter of 2021 there continues to be increased demand for our services particularly those services that address the various challenges in the global labor markets and disruptions to the supply chain while we believe we have adapted to the unique challenges posed by the pandemic surrounding how and where we do our work we are also impacted by the negative effect on workforce availability which could hamper our ability to grow our capacity on pace with increasing demand for our services we expect the market for talent to remain highly competitive for at least the next several months we will continue to monitor the situation and assess any implications to our business and our stakeholders 

supply and labor market disruptions caused by covid19 as well as other factors such as accommodative monetary and fiscal policy have contributed to significant inflation in many of the markets in which we operate this impacts not only the costs to attract and retain employees but also other costs to run and invest in our business if our costs grow significantly in excess of our ability to raise revenues our margins and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives 

the extent to which covid19 impacts our business and financial position will depend on future developments which are difficult to predict these future developments may include the severity and scope of the covid19 outbreak and the emergence of new variants which may unexpectedly change or worsen and the types and duration of measures imposed by governmental authorities to contain the virus or address its impact we continue to expect that the covid19 pandemic and the related impacts on the wider economic environment may cause volatility to our revenue and operating results in fiscal 2022 we believe that as a general matter these trends and uncertainties are similar to those faced by other comparable registrants as a result of the pandemic see part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of actual and potential impacts of covid19 on our business clients and operations 

daily operations  we continue to closely monitor the spread and impact of covid19 including the availability and efficacy of vaccines while adhering to government health directives the company continues to administer its own restrictions on business 

  

travel office access and meetings and events where appropriate but has developed its returntowork plans with a focus on safe utilization based on appropriate socialdistancing guidelines and a continued hybrid work model we have had thorough business continuity and incident management processes in place and operating effectively for the past two years and will continue to do so through the end of the pandemic 

  

transformation program 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2021 we initiated a threeyear ‘transformation program’ designed to enhance operations optimize technology and align our real estate footprint to our new ways of working we expect the program to generate annual cost savings of approximately 300 million by the end of 2024 the program is expected to include cumulative costs of approximately 490 million and capital expenditures of approximately 260 million for a total investment of 750 million the main categories of charges will be in the following four areas 

• real estate rationalization — includes costs to align the real estate footprint to our new ways of working hybrid work and includes breakage fees and the impairment of rightofuse assets and other related leasehold assets 

• technology modernization — these charges are incurred in moving to common platforms and technologies including migrating certain platforms and applications to the cloud this category will include the impairment of technology assets that are duplicative or no longer revenueproducing as well as costs for technology investments that do not qualify for capitalization 

• process optimization — these costs will be incurred in the rightshoring strategy and automation of our operations which will include optimizing resource deployment and appropriate colleague alignment these costs will include process and organizational design costs severance and separationrelated costs and temporary retention costs 

• other — other costs not included above including fees for professional services other contract terminations not related to the above categories and supplier migration costs 

for the year ended december 31 2021 restructuring charges under our transformation program totaled 26 million from the actions taken in 2021 we expect to have annualized savings of 20 million primarily from the reduction of real estate costs the benefits of which will be recognized in 2022

liquidity and capital resources 

executive summary 

our principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities and any new debt offerings these sources of liquidity will fund our shortterm and longterm obligations at december 31 2021 our most significant longterm obligations include mandatory debt and related interest operating leases and pension obligations and contributions to our qualified pension plans additionally during 2021 we divested willis re for 33 billion of proceeds 

the covid19 pandemic has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets including occasional declines in equity markets inflation and changes in interest rates and reduced liquidity on a global basis specific to wtw over the past two years the covid19 pandemic had an initial negative impact on discretionary work we perform for our clients but we later saw increased demand for these services begin to return in the second quarter of 2021 which continues into 2022 we continue to have decreased spending on travel and associated expenses and thirdparty contractors and we have the ability to contain spending on discretionary projects and certain capital expenditures 

based on our current balance sheet and cash flows current market conditions and information available to us at this time we believe that wtw has access to sufficient liquidity which includes all of the borrowing capacity available to draw against our recentlyamended and restated 15 billion revolving credit facility see note 11 — debt in item 8 within this annual report on form 10k to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months including investments in the business for growth scheduled debt repayments share repurchases and dividend payments during the year ended december 31 2021 we made payments of 185 million net of reimbursements for the settlement of obligations related to the stanford and wtw mergerrelated securities litigations and we repaid in full the 450 million of 3500 senior notes which matured in the third quarter of 2021 and the 500 million of 5750 senior notes which matured in the first quarter of 2021 along with the respective interest using currently available cash additionally we repaid in full the principal and interest outstanding on our collateralized facility during the third quarter of 2021 we also restarted our share repurchase programs and during the year ended december 31 2021 we repurchased 16 billion of shares and have authorization to repurchase an additional 39 billion further as of february 18 2022 we have repurchased approximately 15 billion of additional shares 

  

from time to time we will consider whether to repurchase shares based on many factors including market and economic conditions applicable legal requirements and other business considerations the share repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

additionally the operating results and balance sheets of willis re were reclassified to discontinued operations during the current year willis re’s operating cash flows approximate its pretax income and any adjustments for working capital movements see note 3 — acquisitions and divestitures in item 8 within this annual report on form 10k certain costs historically allocated to the willis re business are included in continuing operations and will be retained following the disposal but are expected to be partially offset by reimbursements through the tsa costs incurred to service the tsa are expected to be reduced as part of the company’s transformation program as quickly as possible when the services are no longer required by gallagher 

events that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results potential future acquisitions or divestitures material changes in geographic sources of cash unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters including tax laws or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets 

tax considerations  the company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when it expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments we continue to have certain subsidiaries whose earnings have not been deemed permanently reinvested for which we have been accruing estimates of the tax effects of such repatriation excluding these certain subsidiaries we continue to assert that the historical cumulative earnings for the remainder of our subsidiaries have been reinvested indefinitely and therefore do not provide deferred taxes on these amounts if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital longterm investment requirements or additional legislation necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for income and foreign withholding taxes net of credits may be necessary other potential sources of cash may be through the settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a taxefficient manner 

cash and cash equivalents 

our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 and 2020 totaled 45 billion and 20 billion respectively the increase in cash from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 was driven by our strong operating results including the 1 billion income receipt related to the termination of the proposed aon transaction and the proceeds from the sales of our willis re and miller businesses in the amounts of 33 billion and 696 million respectively these items were partially offset by 16 billion of stock repurchases the full payments of our 450 million of 3500 senior notes and 500 million of 5750 senior notes net legal settlement payments of 185 million related to the stanford and wtw merger settlements tax payments of 383 million primarily related to the disposal of willis re and the income receipt of the termination payment and higher bonus payments and benefitrelated items of 250 million made during the year ended december 31 2021

the notes issued by willis north america and trinity acquisition plc

constant currency change and organic change 

we evaluate our revenue on an as reported us gaap constant currency and organic basis we believe presenting constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally 

• constant currency change  represents the yearoveryear change in revenue excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to calculate this impact the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates the change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenue translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates to the current year as reported revenue for the same period we believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effects that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on periodoverperiod comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets 

• organic change  excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as described above and the periodoverperiod impact of acquisitions and divestitures on currentyear revenue we believe that excluding transactionrelated items from our us gaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors and it is important in illustrating what our core operating results would have been had we not included these transactionrelated items since the nature size and number of these transactionrelated items can vary from period to period 

the constant currency and organic change results and a reconciliation from the reported results for consolidated revenue are included in the ‘consolidated revenue continuing operations’ section within this form 10k these measures are also reported by segment in the ‘segment revenue’ section within this form 10k

adjusting for the impacts of foreign currency and acquisitions and disposals in the calculation of our organic activity our revenue grew by 1 for the year ended december 31 2020 the crb and bda segments had organic revenue growth during the year while the hcb and irr segments were flat in part due to the impact of the covid19 reduction in demand for our discretionary services mostly for hcb 

adjusted operating incomemargin 

we consider adjusted operating incomemargin to be important financial measures which are used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors 

adjusted operating income is defined as income from operations adjusted for amortization transaction and integration net and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results adjusted operating income margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by revenue 

reconciliations of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 are as follows 

  

   

i for additional information  see the disclosure under wtw mergerrelated securities litigation in note 15 — commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k 

  

adjusted operating income increased for the year ended december 31 2021 to 18 billion from 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 this increase resulted primarily from higher revenue 

  

adjusted operating income for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was 16 billion a decrease of 1 million 

adjusted ebitdamargin 

we consider adjusted ebitdamargin to be important financial measures which are used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations to benchmark our operating results against our competitors and to evaluate and measure our performancebased compensation plans 

  

adjusted ebitda is defined as net income adjusted for income from discontinued operations net of tax provision for income taxes interest expense depreciation and amortization transaction and integration net gains and losses on disposals of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results adjusted ebitda margin is calculated by dividing adjusted ebitda by revenue

adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2020 was 21 billion compared to 20 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 this increase resulted primarily from higher revenue and pension income partially offset by higher salaries and benefits expense 

adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share 

adjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to wtw adjusted for income from discontinued operations net of tax amortization transaction and integration net gains and losses on disposals of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments and the tax effects of internal reorganizations this measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share 

adjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock diluted adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors 

  

reconciliations of net income attributable to wtw to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 are as follows 

  

   

i for additional information see the disclosure under wtw mergerrelated securities litigation in note 15 — commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k

iii per share values and totals may differ due to rounding 

our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to higher revenue 

our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to higher revenue and pension income partially offset by higher salaries and benefits expense 

adjusted income before taxes and adjusted income taxestax rate 

adjusted income before taxes is defined as income from operations before income taxes adjusted for amortization transaction and integration net gains and losses on disposals of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate 

adjusted income taxestax rate is defined as the provision for income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization transaction and integration net gains and losses on disposals of operations the tax effects of internal reorganizations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results divided by adjusted income before taxes adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate 

management believes that the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate that we would incur if not for the reduction of pretax income for the adjusted items and the tax effects of internal reorganizations which are not core to our current and future operations 

  

reconciliations of income from continuing operations before income taxes to adjusted income before taxes and provision for income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 are as follows 

  

   

i for additional information see the disclosure under wtw mergerrelated securities litigation in note 15 — commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k 

ii the tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item 

our us gaap tax rates were 199 247 and 188 for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2021 includes a 250 million estimated tax expense related to the income receipt of the termination payment the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 was higher primarily due to tax expense of 61 million recognized in connection with the temporary income tax provisions of the cares act during 2020 the company elected to utilize the higher section 163j 50 percent business interest limitation for tax years 2019 and 2020 which allowed the company to utilize additional interest expense the utilization of additional interest expense reduced our regular tax liability however it created a base erosion minimum tax expense for these tax years the beat effectively applies a 10 percent minimum tax if modified taxable income as adjusted for base erosion payments is greater than the regular tax liability for a year 

our adjusted income tax rates were 207 208 and 205 for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use free cash flow is a liquidity measure and is not meant to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures 

management believes that free cash flow presents the core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations 

reconciliations of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 are as follows 

  

 the favorable movement in free cash flows in 2021 was primarily due to the 1 billion of income receipt related to the termination of the proposed aon transaction partially offset by 383 million in tax payments primarily related to the disposal of willis re and the 

  

income receipt of the termination payment net legal settlement payments of 185 million and 250 million of increased bonus and benefitrelated payments made during the year ended december 31 2021 

additionally the free cash flow for both the current and prior years presented include the operating cash flows of willis re through december 1 2021 willis re’s operating cash flows approximate its pretax income and any adjustments for working capital movements see note 3 — acquisitions and divestitures within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information the absence of which is expected to be partially made up by reimbursements through the tsa 

the favorable movement in free cash flows in 2020 was primarily due to positive cash flows from our improved working capital position driven by effective management of discretionary spending for the year ended december 31 2020 our free cash flows in 2020 were partially offset by transaction and integration expenses primarily related to the proposed combination with aon 

critical accounting estimates 

these consolidated financial statements conform to us gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period our estimates judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates the areas that we believe include critical accounting estimates are revenue recognition costs to fulfill under our broking contracts valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients income taxes commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities pension assumptions and goodwill and intangible assets the critical accounting estimates discussed below involve making difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations these critical accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption different estimates that we could have used or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

revenue recognition 

we use significant estimates related to revenue recognition most commonly during our estimation of the transaction prices or where we recognize revenue over time on a proportional performance basis a brief description of these policies and estimates is included below 

estimation of transaction prices — this process occurs most frequently in certain broking transactions in situations in which our fees are not fixed but are variable we must estimate the likely commission per policy taking into account the likelihood of cancellation before the end of the policy for medicare broking affinity arrangements and proportional treaty reinsurance broking the commissions to which we will be entitled can vary based on the underlying individual insurance policies that are placed for medicare broking and proportional treaty reinsurance in particular we base the estimates of transaction prices on supportable evidence from an analysis of past transactions and only include amounts that are probable of being received or not refunded referred to as applying ‘constraint’ under asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  in our directtoconsumer medicare broking arrangements the estimate of the total renewal commissions that will be received over the lifetime of the policy requires significant judgment and will vary based on product type estimated commission rates the expected lives of the respective policies and other factors the company has applied an actuarial model to account for these uncertainties which is updated periodically based on actual experience each of these processes result in us estimating a transaction price that may be significantly lower than the ultimate amount of commissions we may collect the transaction price is then adjusted over time as we receive confirmation of our remuneration through receipt of commissions or as other information becomes available 

proportional performance basis over time recognition — where we recognize revenue on a proportional performance basis primarily in our consulting and outsourced administration arrangements the amount we recognize is affected by a number of factors that can change the estimated amount of work required to complete the project such as the staffing on the engagement andor the level of client participation our periodic engagement evaluations require us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stages of project completion that in turn affect how we recognize revenue we recognize a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than the total estimated costs associated with the engagement losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 

costs to fulfill —broking contracts 

for our broking business the company must estimate the fulfillment costs incurred during the preplacement of the broking contracts these judgments include the following 

• which activities in the preplacement process should be eligible for capitalization 

• the amount of time and effort expended on those preplacement activities 

  

• the amount of payroll and related costs eligible for capitalization and 

• the monthly or quarterly timing of underlying insurance and reinsurance policy inception dates 

valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from a client’s failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered which are recorded in other operating expenses we also maintain allowances related to our unbilled receivables for such items as expected realization or client disputes the related provision for which is recorded as a reduction to revenue our allowance policy is based in part on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on our writeoff history however facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due general market conditions at the time we perform the work current economic trends and our clients’ ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables 

income taxes 

the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized for continuing operations in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the change is enacted deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as based on available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company adjusts valuation allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amounts considered realizable in future periods which is assessed at each balance sheet date in making such determinations the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operating results we place more reliance on evidence that is objectively verifiable 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance and the provision of consulting services in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice in certain cases where a range of loss exists we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount 

see note 15 — commitments and contingencies in item 8 within this annual report on form 10k 

pension assumptions 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in several countries with the most significant defined benefit plans offered in the us and uk our disclosures in note 13 — retirement benefits contain additional information about our other less significant but material retirement plans within our critical accounting policy discussion we have excluded analysis for plans outside of those noted in the description below as any variance of recorded information based on management’s estimates would be immaterial 

descriptions of our us and uk plans which comprise 90 of our projected benefit obligations and 93 of our plan assets are below 

united states 

legacy willis – this plan was frozen in 2009 approximately onequarter of the legacy willis employees in the united states have a frozen accrued benefit under this plan 

wtw plan – substantially all us employees are eligible to participate in this plan benefits are provided under a stable value pension plan design the original stable value design came into effect on january 1 2012 plan participants prior to july 1 2017 earn benefits without having to make employee contributions and all newlyeligible employees after that date are required to contribute 2 of pay on an aftertax basis to participate in the plan 

  

united kingdom 

legacy willis – this plan covers approximately onefifth of the legacy willis employees in the united kingdom the plan is now closed to new entrants new employees in the united kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan 

legacy towers watson – benefit accruals earned under the legacy watson wyatt defined benefit plan predominantly pension benefits ceased on february 28 2015 although benefits earned prior to january 1 2008 retain a link to salary until the employee leaves the company benefit accruals earned under the legacy towers perrin defined benefit plan predominantly lump sum benefits were frozen on march 31 2008 all participants now accrue defined contribution benefits 

the determination of the company’s obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that given the longevity of the plans are longterm in focus a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation however certain of these changes such as changes in the discount rates and other actuarial assumptions are not recognized immediately in net income but are instead recorded in other comprehensive income the accumulated gains and losses not yet recognized in net income are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit costincome over the average remaining service period or average remaining life expectancy as appropriate of the plan’s participants to the extent that the net gains or losses as of the beginning of the year exceed 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation 

wtw considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions including economic forecasts relevant benchmarks historical trends portfolio composition and peer company comparisons these assumptions used to determine our pension liabilities and pension expense are reviewed annually by senior management and changed when appropriate a discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas an expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longerterm trends in asset returns emerge or longterm target asset allocations are revised to calculate the discount rate we use the granular approach to determining service cost and interest cost the expected rate of return assumptions for all plans are supported by an analysis of the weightedaverage yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality and the expected longterm rates of compensation and pension increases 

funding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes or as agreed to with the plan trustees for the uk plans since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes pension contributions are not equal to net periodic benefit cost 

we recorded a combined 186 million net periodic benefit income for our us and uk plans for the year ended december 31 2021 for the us and uk plans the following table presents our estimated net periodic benefit income for 2022 and the impact to both plans of a 025 increase and decrease to both the expected return on assets ‘eroa’ and the discount rate assumptions and the projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2021 and the impact of a 025 increase and decrease to the discount rates 

  

 economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

goodwill and intangible assets — impairment review 

in applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with the remainder recorded as goodwill intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise the fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the 

  

amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise 

goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and the company had eight reporting units as of october 1 2021 

during fiscal year 2021 the company performed the impairment test for all reporting units each of the reporting unit’s estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values and we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill to perform the test we used valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit that are under the income andor market approaches of valuation methods under the discounted cash flow method an income approach the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debtfree aftertax cash flows for a finite period of years key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management assessment of business risk and expected rates of return on capital the guideline company method a market approach develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies key estimates and determination of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies obtaining forecast revenue and ebitda estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics under the similar transactions method a market approach actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units are used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualita tive disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 — basis of presentation significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements and note 10 — derivative financial instruments within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

foreign exchange risk 

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the us we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earn revenue in several currencies but incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling 

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenue and expenses from continuing operations by currency in 2021 

  

   

 

i these percentages exclude certain expenses for significant items which will not be settled in cash or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations these items include amortization of intangible assets and transaction and integration net 

our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from 

• our london market operations 

• intercompany lending between subsidiaries and 

• translation 

london market operations 

the company’s primary foreign exchange risks in its london market operations arise from changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and pound sterling as its london market operations earn the majority of its revenue in us dollars but incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling and may also hold significant foreign currency asset or liability positions on its consolidated balance sheet in addition the london market operations earn significant revenue in euro and japanese yen 

the foreign exchange risks in our london market operations are hedged to the extent that 

• forecasted pounds sterling expenses exceed pounds sterling revenue in which case the company limits its exposure to this exchange rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to a portion of the forecasted pounds sterling outflows arising in the ordinary course of business in addition we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any net pounds sterling asset or liability position in our london market operations and 

• the uk operations also earn significant revenue in euro and japanese yen the company limits its exposure to changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and these currencies by the use of foreign exchange contracts matched to a proportion of forecast cash inflows in these specific currencies and periods 

intercompany lending between subsidiaries 

the company engages in intercompany borrowing and lending between subsidiaries primarily through our inhouse banking operations which give rise to foreign exchange exposures the company mitigates these risks through the use of shortterm foreign currency forward and swap transactions that offset the underlying exposure created when the borrower and lender have different functional currencies these derivatives are not generally designated as hedging instruments and at december 31 2021 we had notional amounts of 29 billion denominated primarily in us dollars pound sterling euro and australian dollars with a net asset fair value of 15 million such derivatives typically mature within three months 

  

translation risk 

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenue and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weightedaverage contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within two years 

  

   

 

i represents the difference between the contract amount and the cash flow in us dollars which would have been receivable had the foreign currency forward exchange contracts been entered into on december 31 2021 at the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date 

income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the uk is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency however the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities 

interest rate risk 

the company has access to 15 billion under a newlyamended and restated revolving credit facility see note 11 — debt within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information as of december 31 2021 no amount was drawn on this facility we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in us dollars pounds sterling and euros 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the company had no outstanding floating ratebased debt at december 31 2021 

  

   

 

i represents the net present value of the expected cash flows discounted at current market rates of interest or quoted market rates as appropriate 

interest income on fiduciary funds 

as a result of our operating activities we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies we earn interest on these funds which is included in our consolidated financial statements as interest income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity at december 31 2021 we held 19 billion of fiduciary funds invested in interestbearing accounts 

  

if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 25 basis points interest earned on these invested fiduciary funds and therefore our interest income recognized would increase or decrease by approximately 5 million on an annualized basis 

liborrelated debt instruments 

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced its intention to phase out libor as a benchmark rate by the end of 2021 the alternative reference rates committee ‘arrc’ a group of privatemarket participants convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york to help ensure a successful transition from us dollar libor ‘usdlibor’ to a more robust reference rate has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate ‘sofr’ represents the best alternative to usdlibor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to usdlibor arrc has proposed a transition plan with specific steps and timelines designed to encourage the adoption of sofr and guide the transition to sofr from usdlibor organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to usdlibor similar efforts are underway to identify suitable replacement reference rates for libor in other major currencies 

subsequently on march 5 2021 ice benchmark administration ‘iba’ stated that as a result of its not having access to input data necessary to calculate libor settings on a representative basis beyond the intended cessation dates as set forth below it would have to cease publication of all 35 libor settings immediately after december 31 2021 for all gbp eur chf and jpylibor settings as well as 1week and 2month usdlibor settings effective after june 30 2023 iba will cease publishing overnight and 1 3 6 and 12month usdlibor settings 

prior to october 2021 the company’s primary exposure was its 125 billion revolving credit facility which was then replaced with a new 15 billion revolving credit facility which contains appropriate libor replacement language as described in note 11 debt – revolving credit facility within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k additionally the company repaid and closed its collateralized facility during november 2021 as described in note 11 debt – collateralized facility within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k on january 1 2022 the company made changes to its liborbased intercompany notes and following this change none of the company’s impacted debt instruments are currently linked to libor thus minimizing the company’s exposure to known risks related to the transition from libor to alternative rates 

we have updated our treasury workstation software to implement the new benchmarks and continue to monitor the liborrelated risks that may be inherent elsewhere in our business and are monitoring further proposals and guidance from the arrc and other alternativerate initiatives while it is currently uncertain whether sofr or another reference rate will be selected as the alternative to libor or whether other reforms will be enacted in response to the planned transition we will make the appropriate changes when necessary 

credit risk and concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted the company currently does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties the company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents fiduciary funds accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value 

the company maintains a policy of providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure these financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the company does business as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas management does not believe that significant risk exists in connection with the company’s concentrations of credit as of december 31 2021

risk factors

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements these risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business the descriptions below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown to us could also impair our business operations financial condition or results if any of the risks and uncertainties below or other risks were to occur our business operations financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted with respect to the taxrelated consequences of acquisition ownership and disposal of ordinary shares you should consult with your own tax advisors 

combinationrelated risks 

our pending combination with aon creates incremental business regulatory and reputational risks

on march 9 2020 the company announced that it had entered into a business combination agreement with aon the proposed transaction with aon entails important risks including among others the risk that we are unable to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or satisfy all of the other conditions required to consummate the proposed transaction on the proposed terms and schedule if at all the risk that we and aon are unable to successfully integrate our combined operations and employees and realize the proposed transaction’s benefits including potential synergies or that we are unable to realize such benefits at the times and to the extent anticipated or that results are different from those contained in forecasts when made the risk that transaction andor integration costs or dissynergies are greater than expected including as a result of conditions regulators put on any approvals of the transaction the impact of the announcement andor the potential impact of the consummation of the proposed transaction on relationships including with employees suppliers clients and competitors the risk that we andor the combined company will not have the ability to hire and retain key personnel the risk that management’s attention is diverted from other matters during the pendency of the combination the risk that litigation associated with the proposed combination affects the combination or the business otherwise the risk of disruptions from the proposed transaction that impact our andor aon’s business including current plans and operations the risk posed by extensive government regulation on our business andor the business of the combined company the risk of adverse effects on the market price of aon’s and the company’s securities and on aon’s and the company’s operating results for any reason and other risks described below and in the company’s other sec filings 

the combination is subject to customary closing conditions including conditions related to required regulatory approvals and may not be completed on a timely basis or at all or may be completed on a basis that has a material adverse impact on the value of the combined company

the closing of the combination is subject to a number of customary conditions and there can be no assurance that all of the conditions to the closing of the combination will be satisfied or waived to the extent applicable in a timely manner or at all the failure to satisfy the required conditions could delay the closing of the combination for a significant period of time or prevent the closing of the combination from occurring at all these closing conditions include among others certain antitrustrelated clearances including under the us hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 referred to as the ‘hsr act’ the european commission merger regulation and the antitrust laws of the other required antitrust jurisdictions these closing conditions also include certain other regulatory clearances

the governmental agencies from which the parties are seeking certain approvals related to these conditions have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations as a condition to their approval of the combination agencies may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business after the closing of the combination such requirements limitations costs or restrictions could delay or prevent the closing of the combination or have a material adverse effect on the combined company’s business and results of operations following the closing of the combination

in addition the closing conditions include other legal and regulatory conditions such as i the sanction by the irish high court of the scheme and the delivery of the court order to the irish registrar of companies ii the approval by the nyse of the listing of all of the aon shares to be issued in connection with the scheme and iii the absence of any law or order that restrains enjoins makes illegal or otherwise prohibits the closing of the combination

the combination is also subject to other customary closing conditions including i the business combination agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its terms ii the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties made in the business combination agreement between the company and aon subject to specified materiality standards iii the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to each party since march 9 2020 and iv the performance and compliance by each party of all of its obligations and compliance with all of its covenants under the business combination agreement in all material respects there can be 

 

no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the combination will be satisfied or waived or that the combination will be completed within the expected time frame or at all 

in addition if the combination is not completed by march 9 2021 or june 9 2021 or september 9 2021 if automatically extended under the terms of the business combination agreement if applicable or such earlier date as may be specified by the irish takeover panel either aon or the company may choose not to proceed with the combination the parties can mutually decide to terminate the business combination agreement at any time

the combination subjects us to various significant restrictions on our operations between signing and closing

the business combination agreement subjects the company to various significant restrictions on its operations between signing and closing those include among others with respect to share repurchases the incurrence of debt above thresholds or the acquisition or disposition of assets above specified thresholds and specified changes to compensation and benefit programs in addition under irish law many of the same and certain additional actions occurring between signing and closing require the prior approval of the irish takeover panel if the company desires to take any of the specified actions and does not receive the consent of aon andor the irish takeover panel these restrictions may prevent the company from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or making changes to its business or operations prior to the closing of the combination or the termination of the business combination agreement which in turn could materially impact the company’s financial condition and results of operation

failure to close the combination could negatively impact the share price and the future business and financial results of the company

if the combination is not completed for any reason the company’s ongoing business may be adversely affected and without realizing the potential benefits of the completion of the combination the company will be subject to a number of risks including the following













if the combination does not close these risks may materialize and may adversely affect the company’s business financial results and share price

litigation filed against us could prevent or delay the completion of the combination or result in the payment of damages following completion of the combination

we and members of our board of directors have been and may in the future be parties among others to various claims and litigation related to the business combination agreement and the combination the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the completion of the combination in a timely manner or at all and could result in substantial costs to us including but not limited to costs associated with the indemnification of our directors and officers moreover such litigation could be time consuming and expensive and such litigation could divert our management’s attention away from their regular businesses adverse rulings in any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

one of the conditions to the closing of the combination is that no order whether temporary or permanent has been issued promulgated made rendered or entered into by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction which restrains enjoins makes illegal or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the combination excluding certain laws and orders unrelated to the required 

 

antitrust clearances and the required regulatory clearances consequently if any suits are brought and plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the company and aon from completing the combination on the terms contemplated by the business combination agreement such an injunction may delay the completion of the combination in the expected timeframe or may prevent the combination from being completed altogether 

strategic operational and technology risks 

our success largely depends on our ability to achieve our global business strategy as it evolves and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer if the company were unable to successfully establish and execute on its strategy and generate anticipated revenue growth and cost savings and efficiencies

our future growth profitability and cash flows largely depend upon our ability to successfully establish and execute our global business strategy as discussed under item 1 ‘business  business strategy’ we seek to be an advisory broking and solutions provider of choice through an integrated global platform while we have confidence that our strategic plan reflects opportunities that are appropriate and achievable there is a possibility that our strategy may not deliver projected longterm growth in revenue and profitability due to inadequate execution incorrect assumptions global or local economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we operate suboptimal resource allocation or any of the other risks described in this ‘risk factors’ section in addition our strategy continues to evolve and it is possible that we will be unable to successfully execute the associated strategy changes due to factors discussed above or elsewhere in this ‘risk factors’ section in pursuit of our growth strategy we may also invest significant time and resources into new product or service offerings and there is the possibility that these offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment the failure to continually develop and execute optimally on our global business strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we have been impacted by the covid19 pandemic and may be substantially and negatively impacted by it in the future

the covid19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on global commercial activity including the global supply chain and has contributed to strain in financial markets including among other effects significant volatility in equity markets changes in interest rates and reduced liquidity on a global basis it has also resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdowns of businesses in various industries including among others travel trade tourism health systems and food supply and significantly reduced overall economic output as such there is a risk that covid19 could have a substantial negative impact on client demand and cash flow

covid19 risks magnify other risks discussed in this report and any of our sec filings for example the effectiveness of external parties including governmental and nongovernmental organizations in combating the spread and severity of covid19 could have a material impact on demand for our business in addition steps taken by market counterparties such as reinsurance carriers to limit their exposures to covid19 and related risks could have an impact on their willingness to provide or renew coverage for our clients on historical terms and pricing which could again impact demand for our business coverage disputes arising out of the pandemic could also increase our professional liability risk by increasing the frequency and severity of allegations by others that in the course of providing services we have committed errors or omissions for which we should have liability also travel restrictions have caused the postponement modification or cancellation of various conferences and meetings around the world and adversely impacted sales activity the rapid development and fluidity of the covid19 pandemic including the continued development availability distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine precludes any prediction as to the duration of the covid19 pandemic and the ultimate adverse impact of covid19 on our business nevertheless covid19 continues to present material uncertainty and risk with respect to demand for our products and services

in addition covid19 has disrupted certain aspects of our business and could continue to disrupt possibly materially our own business operations and the services we provide as well as the business operations of our clients suppliers and other third parties with whom we interact as an increasing percentage of our colleagues continue to work remotely we face resiliency risks such as the risk that our information technology platform could potentially be inadequate to support increasing demand as well as the risk that unusual working arrangements could impact the effectiveness of our operations or controls the economic disruption caused by covid19 has impacted the pace at which we have made information technologybased investments and we may continue to make fewer information technologybased investments than previously anticipated which could potentially create business operational risk in addition we depend on thirdparty platforms and other infrastructure to provide certain of our products and services and such thirdparty infrastructures face similar resiliency risks these factors have exposed us to increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks as cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic as well as an increase in the number of points of potential attack such as laptops and mobile devices both of which are now being used in increased numbers as many of our employees work remotely to be secured a failure to effectively manage these risks including to promptly identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks may adversely affect our business

 

also a potential covid19 infection of any of our key colleagues could substantially and negatively impact our operations further it is possible that covid19 causes us to close down call centers and other processes on which we rely or impacts processes of thirdparty vendors on whom we rely which could also materially impact our operations resultant changes in financial markets could also have a material impact on our own hedging and other financial transactions which could impact our liquidity in addition it is possible that covid19 restrictions could create difficulty for satisfying our legal or regulatory filing or other obligations including with the sec and other regulators 

all of the foregoing events or potential outcomes including in combination with other risk factors included in this annual report on form 10k could cause a substantial negative effect on our results of operations in any period and depending on their severity could also substantially and negatively affect our financial condition furthermore such potential material adverse effects may lag behind the developments related to the covid19 pandemic such events and outcomes also could potentially impact our reputation with clients and regulators among others 

demand for our services could decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn increased competition or a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or prospects all of which could materially adversely affect us

we can give no assurance that the demand for our services will grow or be maintained or that we will compete successfully with our existing competitors new competitors or our clients’ internal capabilities client demand for our services may change based on the clients’ needs and financial conditions among other factors

our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve for example any changes in us trade policy including any increases in tariffs that result in a trade war ongoing stock market volatility or an increase in  or unmet market expectations with respect to interest rates could adversely affect the general economy as a result global financial markets may continue to experience disruptions including increased volatility and reduced credit availability which could substantially impact our results likewise covid19 and related economic disruption could have a material adverse impact on global demand from our clients in addition to the potential impact of pandemics on our own operations discussed elsewhere in this report while it is difficult to predict the consequences of any deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing our services or insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the potential for a significant insurer to fail be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenue and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients

in addition the markets for our principal services are highly competitive our competitors include other insurance brokerage including directtoconsumer medicare brokerage human capital and risk management consulting and actuarial firms and the human capital and risk management divisions of diversified professional services insurance brokerage and accounting firms and specialty regional and local firms

competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and some competitors have greater market share in certain lines of business than we do some of our competitors have greater financial technical and marketing resources than us which could enhance their ability to finance acquisitions fund internal growth and respond more quickly to professional and technological changes new competitors as well as increasing and evolving consolidation or alliances among existing competitors have created and could continue to create additional competition and could significantly reduce our market share resulting in a loss of business for us and a corresponding decline in revenue and profit margin in order to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure we may have to lower our prices which would also have an adverse effect on our revenue and profit margin

in addition existing and new competitors whether traditional competitors or nontraditional competitors such as technology companies could develop competing technologies or product or service offerings that disrupt our industries any new technology or product or service offering including insurance companies selling their products directly to consumers or other insureds that reduces or eliminates the need for intermediaries in insurance or reinsurance sales transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further the increasing willingness of clients to either selfinsure or maintain a captive insurance company and the development of capital marketsbased solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs could also materially adversely affect us and our results of operations

an example of a business that may be significantly impacted by changes in customer demand is our retirement consulting and actuarial business which comprises a substantial portion of our revenue and profit we provide clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans defined benefit pension plans generally require more 

 

actuarial services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools complex calculations to determine employer costs funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate or if we are unable to otherwise compensate for the decline in our business that results from employers moving away from defined benefit plans our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected furthermore large and complex consulting projects often involving dedicated personnel resources and expenses comprise a significant portion of this business which are based on our clients’ discretionary needs and may be reduced based on a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or prospects we also face the risk that certain large and complex project contracts may be reduced or terminated based on dissatisfaction with service levels which could result in reduced revenue writeoffs of assets associated with the project and disputes over the contract all of which may adversely impact our results and business 

in addition the demand for many of our core benefit services including compliancerelated services is affected by government regulation and taxation of employee benefit plans significant changes in tax or social welfare policy or other regulations could lead some employers to discontinue their employee benefit plans including defined benefit pension plans thereby reducing the demand for our services a simplification of regulations or tax policy also could reduce the need for our services

data security breaches or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could result in material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

we depend on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners insurance carriersmarkets clients and thirdparty vendors additionally one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their customers and employees our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks we are the target of computer viruses hackers distributed denial of service attacks malware infections ransomware attacks phishing and spearphishing campaigns andor other external hazards as well as improper or inadvertent workforce behavior which could expose confidential company and personal data systems and information to security breaches

many of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from and supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors our thirdparty applications include but are not limited to enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services provided and maintained by thirdparty vendors these thirdparty applications store or may afford access to confidential and proprietary data of the company our employees and our clients we have processes designed to require thirdparty vendors that provide it outsourcing offsite storage and other services to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however this data is at risk of compromise or unauthorized access or use in the event of a breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent or as a result of a cyberattack on the product software or information systems of a vendor in our software supply chain any compromise of the product software data or infrastructure of a company vendor including a software or it vendor in our supply chain could in turn result in the compromise of company data or infrastructure or result in material operational disruption further the risk and potential impact of a data breach on our thirdparty vendors’ products software or systems increase as we move more of our data and our clients’ data into our vendors’ cloud storage engage in it outsourcing and consolidate the group of thirdparty vendors that provide cloud storage or other it services for the company over time the frequency severity and sophistication of the attacks against us and our vendors have increased including due to the use of artificial intelligence for purposes of cybercrime and the broader range of threat actors including statesponsored actors and hacker activists

we and our vendors regularly experience cybersecurity incidents including successful attacks from time to time and we expect that to continue going forward cybersecurity incidents include those resulting from human error or malfeasance implantation of malware and viruses phishing and spearphishing attacks unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems and unauthorized access to data or individual account funds through fraud or other means of deceiving our colleagues thirdparty service providers and vendors we have experienced successful attacks by various types of hacking groups in which personal and commercially sensitive information belonging to the company or its clients has been compromised however none of these cybersecurity incidents or attacks to our knowledge have been material to our business or financial results we cannot assure that such cybersecurity incidents or attacks will not have a material impact on our business or financial results in the future when required by law we have notified individuals and relevant regulatory authorities such as insurancefinancial services regulators and privacy regulators of such cybersecurity incidents or attacks

we maintain policies procedures and administrative physical and technological safeguards such as where in place multifactor authentication and encryption of data in transit and at rest designed to protect the security and privacy of the data in our custody and control however such safeguards are timeconsuming and expensive to deploy broadly and are not necessarily always in place or effective and we cannot entirely   eliminate the risk of data security breaches improper access to takeover of or disclosure of 

 

confidential company or personally identifiable information we may not be able to detect and assess such issues or implement appropriate remediation in a timely manner we are engaged in an ongoing effort to enhance our protections against such attacks this effort will require significant expenditures and may not be successful our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we hold and protect it from theft computer viruses hackers or inadvertent loss 

if any person including any of our colleagues intentionally or unintentionally fails to comply with disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines regulatory enforcement andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client supplier or employee data whether through systems failure accident employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our colleagues or third parties could result in significant additional expenses including expenses relating to incident response and investigation remediation work notification of data security breaches and costs of credit monitoring services negative publicity operational disruption legal liability and damage to our reputation as well as require substantial resources and effort of management thereby diverting management’s focus and resources from business operations

the methods used to obtain unauthorized access to disable or degrade service or sabotage the company’s systems are also constantly evolving are increasingly sophisticated and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for example the us federal bureau of investigation ‘fbi’ the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency and other us federal agencies continue to issue warnings about trends in cybercriminal and nationstate activity and other threats that are consistent with some of the types of incidents we have experienced to our knowledge these incidents have not had a material impact on our business or operations thus far however our reputation could be harmed and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we were to be the target of such attacks in the future or if despite our controls and efforts to detect breaches we were to be the victim of an undetected breach 

we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to and use of secured data and to prevent data loss the everevolving threats mean that we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate adapt enhance and otherwise improve our respective systems and processes especially as we grow our mobile cloud and other internetbased services there is no guarantee that such efforts will be adequate to safeguard against all fraud data security breaches unauthorized access operational impacts or misuses of data for example our policies employee training including phishing prevention training procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential personal or proprietary information by employees vendors or other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems in addition we may not be able to implement such efforts as quickly as desired if for example greater resources are required than originally expected or resources and management’s focus are insufficient any future significant compromise or breach of our data security or fraud whether external or internal or misuse of client colleague supplier or company data could result in additional significant costs lost revenue opportunities disruption of operations and service fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation with our clients and in the broader market  

we could be subject to claims and lawsuits arising from our work which could materially adversely affect our reputation business and financial condition

we depend in large part on our relationships with clients and our reputation for highquality services to secure future engagements clients that become dissatisfied with our services may terminate their business relationships with us and clients and third parties that claim they suffered damages caused by our services may bring lawsuits against us we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the provision of our services or the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims see note 14  commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k for examples of claims to which we are subject

because we often assist our clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money and complex regulatory requirements including actuarial services asset management technology solutions development and implementation and the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may arise that allege our potential liability for all or part of the substantial amounts in question the nature of our work particularly our actuarial services necessarily involves the use of assumptions and the preparation of estimates relating to future and contingent events the actual outcome of which we cannot know in advance our actuarial and brokerage services also rely on substantial amounts of data provided by clients the accuracy and quality of which we may not be able to ensure in addition we could make computational software programming or data management errors in connection with the services we provide to clients

clients may seek to hold us responsible for alleged errors or omissions relating to any of the brokerage advice and services we provide including when claims they submit to their insurance carriers are disputed or denied this risk is likely to be higher in 

 

circumstances such as claims related to covid19 where there are significant disputes between clients and insurance carriers over coverage given that many of our clients have very high insurance policy limits to cover their risks alleged errors and omissions claims against us arising from disputed or denied claims are often significant moreover in certain circumstances our brokerage investment and certain other types of business may not limit the maximum liability to which we may be exposed for claims involving alleged errors or omissions and as such we do not have limited liability for the work we provide to the associated clients 

further given that we frequently work with large pension funds and insurance companies as well as other large clients relatively small percentage errors or variances can create significant financial variances and result in significant claims for unintended or unfunded liabilities the risks from such variances or errors could be aggravated in an environment of declining pension fund asset values and insurance company capital levels in almost all cases our exposure to liability with respect to a particular engagement is substantially greater than the revenue opportunity that the engagement generates for us

clients may seek to hold us responsible for the financial consequences of variances between assumptions and estimates and actual outcomes or for errors for example in the case of pension plan actuarial work a client’s claims might focus on the client’s alleged reliance on actuarial assumptions that it believes were unreasonable and based on such reliance the client made benefit commitments that it may later claim are not affordable or funding decisions that result in plan underfunding if and when actual outcomes vary from actuarial assumptions

we also continue to create new products and services including increasingly complex technology solutions and to grow the business of providing products and services to institutional investors financial services companies and other clients the risk of claims from these lines of business and related products and services may be greater than from our core products or services and such claims may be for significant amounts as we take on increasingly complicated projects including those with complex regulatory requirements

we also provide advice on both asset allocation and selection of investment managers increasingly for many clients we are responsible for making decisions on both of these matters or we may serve in a fiduciary capacity either of which may increase liability exposure in addition the company offers affiliated investment funds including in the us and ireland with plans to launch additional funds over time given that our investment business may recommend affiliated investment funds or affirmatively invest such clients’ assets in such funds under delegated authority this may increase our liability exposure we may also be liable for actions of managers or other service providers to the funds further for certain clients we are responsible for some portions of cash and investment management including rebalancing of investment portfolios and guidance to third parties on the structure of derivatives and securities transactions asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and investment managers may underperform their benchmarks in both cases the investment return shortfall can be significant clients experiencing this underperformance including from our affiliated investment funds may assert claims against us and such claims may be for significant amounts in addition our failure to properly execute our role can cause monetary damage to our clients or such third parties for which we might be found liable and such claims may be for significant amounts our expected expansion of this business geographically and in new offerings will subject us to additional contractual exposures and obligations with investors asset managers and third party service providers as well as increased regulatory exposures overall our ability to contractually limit our potential liability may be limited in certain jurisdictions or markets or in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary duties or other alleged errors or omissions

the ultimate outcome of all of the above matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us in addition our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against such liabilities it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the industries we operate in or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships in addition defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs

as a highlyregulated company we are subject from time to time to inquiries or investigations by governmental agencies or regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations

we have also been and may continue to be subject to inquiries and investigations by federal state or other governmental agencies regarding aspects of our clients’ businesses or our own businesses especially regulated businesses such as our insurance broker securities brokerdealer and investment advisory services such inquiries or investigations may consume significant management time and result in regulatory sanctions fines or other actions as well as significant legal fees which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and liquidity also we may face additional regulatory scrutiny as we expand our businesses geographically and in new products and services that we offer

 

examples of these inquiries or investigations are set forth in more detail in note 14 — commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k these include various ongoing civil investigation proceedings in respect of alleged exchanges of commercially sensitive information among competitors in aviation and aerospace insurance and reinsurance broking 

all of these items reflect an increased focus by regulators in the uk us and elsewhere on various aspects of the operations and affairs of our regulated businesses we are unable to predict the outcome of these inquiries or investigations any proposed changes that result from these investigations and inquiries or any other investigations inquiries or regulatory developments or any potential fines or enforcement action could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions we face risks when we acquire or divest businesses and we could have difficulty in acquiring integrating or managing acquired businesses or with effecting internal reorganizations all of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation

our growth depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions we may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms acceptable or favorable to us we also face additional risks related to acquisitions including that we could overpay for acquired businesses and that any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to our expectations in addition we may not repurchase as many of our outstanding shares as anticipated due to our acquisition activity or investment opportunities as well as other market or business conditions if we are unable to identify and successfully make integrate and manage acquisitions our business could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks related to divesting businesses including that we may not receive adequate consideration in return for the divested business we may continue to be subject to the liabilities of the divested business after its divestiture including with respect to work we might have performed on behalf of the divested business and we may not be able to reduce overhead or redeploy assets or retain colleagues after the divestiture closes for example we recently announced that we have agreed to sell miller subject to closing conditions and that transaction may give rise to a number of such risks 

in addition we cannot be certain that our acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or that our acquisitions or divestitures will otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if the operating performance of an acquired business deteriorates significantly we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet

we may be unable to effectively integrate an acquired business into our organization and may not succeed in managing such acquired businesses or the larger company that results from such acquisitions the process of integrating an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks including without limitation an inability to retain the management key personnel and other employees of the acquired business an inability to establish uniform standards controls systems procedures and policies or to achieve anticipated savings and exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition

certain recentlycompleted or pending acquisitions including the acquisition of tranzact a usbased directtoconsumer health care organization that links individuals to us insurance carriers and the acquisition of unity group an insurance broking business with operations in six central american countries entail important incremental risks in addition to those described above with respect to both transactions we face the risk related to the potential impacts of the transaction and integration on relationships including with employees correspondents suppliers clients and competitors as well as the risk related to contingent liabilities including litigation potentially creating material liabilities for the company the following risks in addition to those described above may also adversely affect our ability to successfully implement and integrate these acquisitions material changes in us and foreign jurisdiction regulations including those related to the healthcare system and medicare and insurance brokerage services changes in general economic business and political conditions in relevant markets including changes in the financial markets significant competition in the marketplace and compliance with extensive and evolving government regulations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 

if acquisitions are not successfully integrated and the intended benefits of the acquisitions are not achieved our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as well as our professional reputation we also own an interest in a number of associates and companies where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore limited in our ability to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we could achieve if we had full ownership 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational changes could impact our business results where the level of costs andor disruption may be significant and change over time and the benefits may be less than we originally expect 

we have in the past few years undergone several significant business and organizational changes including multiyear operational improvement programs among others in addition the proposed aon combination has and will continue to create significant postclosing integration planning initiatives there are also a number of other initiatives planned or ongoing to transform and update our 

 

systems and processes and gain efficiencies in addition our strategy continues to evolve and such evolution may result in further organizational changes as we may decide based on our perceived business needs to make investments that may be greater than we currently anticipate in connection with all these changes we may manage a number of largescale and complex projects such projects may include multiple and connected phases many of which may be dependent on factors that are outside of our control while we plan to undertake these types of large complex projects based on our determination that each is necessary or desirable for the execution of the company’s business strategy we cannot guarantee that the collective effect of all of these projects will not adversely impact our business or results of operations or that the benefits will be as we originally expect effectively managing these organizational changes including ensuring that they are implemented on schedule within budget and without interruption to the existing business or that transitions to new systems do not create significant control vulnerabilities during the period of transition is critical to retaining talent servicing clients and our business success overall many of the risks described herein increase during periods of significant organizational change the failure to effectively manage such risks could adversely impact our resources or business or financial results 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic including prolonged effects of the covid19 pandemic security breach ransomware or destructive malware attack power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities access to data and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges with regard to our operations

a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability particularly if any of these problems occur during peak times

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing hardware or systems could cause material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant financial and other resources to maintain and enhance existing systems develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards we rely on being at the forefront of a range of technology options relevant to our business including by staying ahead of the technology offered by our competitors and attracting developing and retaining skilled individuals in the cybersecurity space the market for such qualified individuals is competitive and we may be unable to hire the necessary talent to mitigate the foregoing risks

in addition many of the software applications including enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services that we use in our business are licensed from and supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors we are significantly increasing our use of such cloud services and expect this to continue over time these thirdparty applications store confidential and proprietary data of the company our clients and our employees a suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruptions that could adversely impact our business as a global organization we occasionally acquire other companies or spinoff certain of our existing business lines these strategic business decisions may require us to manage complex integrations or dissolutions of information systems and we may fail to identify vulnerabilities in our targets’ information systems or in integrated components of our respective information systems these transactions may make us more susceptible to cyberattacks and could result in the theft of company intellectual property the compromise of company employee and client data or operational disruption

any finding that the data we rely on to run our business is inaccurate or unreliable that we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer hardware applications or software systems or the loss of skilled people with the knowledge needed to operate older systems or that we experience cost overruns delays or other disruptions could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability

the united kingdom’s exit from the european union which occurred on january 31 2020 and the risk that other countries may follow could adversely affect us

in 2020 approximately 21 of our revenue was generated in the uk although only about 12 of revenue was denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 20 of our expenses were denominated in pounds sterling it remains difficult to predict with any level of certainty the impact that brexit will have on the 

 

economy economic regulatory and political stability and market conditions in europe including in the uk or on the pound sterling euro or other european currencies but any such impacts and others we cannot currently anticipate could materially adversely affect us and our operations among other things we could experience lower growth in the region due to indecision by businesses holding off on generating new projects or due to adverse market conditions and reduced reported revenue and earnings because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars due to the fact that we translate revenue denominated in nonus currencies such as pounds sterling into us dollars for our financial statements in addition there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective 

on december 24 2020 the eu and the uk agreed to the terms of a trade and cooperation agreement the ‘tca’ that reflects certain matters agreed upon between the parties in relation to a broad range of separation issues the tca has been signed and ratified by the uk and signed by the eu the eu parliament has until february 28 2021 to ratify the tca subject to any agreed extension though the tca applies provisionally from january 1 2021 while many separation issues have been resolved some uncertainty remains in relation to the future regulation of financial services among other matters the tca addresses issues related to financial services on a limited basis and the eu and the uk have separately agreed upon a joint declaration on financial services regulatory cooperation the ‘joint declaration’ which among other things provides that the parties will by march 2021 agree to a memorandum of understanding establishing a framework for future regulatory cooperation the british government and the eu will therefore continue over time to negotiate certain terms of the uks future relationship with the eu that are not addressed in the tca the company is heavily invested in the uk through our businesses and activities if the outcomes of brexit and the tca negatively impact the uk then it could have a material adverse impact on us brexit has resulted in greater restrictions on business conducted between the uk and eu countries and has increased regulatory complexities there also remains uncertainty as to how changes to the uks access to the eu single market and the wider trading legal regulatory tax social and labor environments especially in the uk and eu will be impacted over time including the resulting impacts on our business and that of our clients these changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results for example a loss of prebrexit passporting rights or other changed regulations relating to doing business in various eu countries by relying on a regulatory permission in the uk or doing business in the uk by relying on a regulatory permission in an eu country may over time increase our costs of doing business or our ability to do so and thereby adversely impact our operations and financial results 

we believe we have implemented appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business in the countries most affected these arrangements include the transaction of certain businesses andor the movement of certain businesses outside of the uk however various significant risks remain in relation to the effects of the postbrexit arrangements between the eu and uk some of which have yet to be agreed upon including the following among others













there is also a risk that other countries may decide to leave the eu we cannot predict the impact that any additional countries leaving the eu will have on us but any such impacts could materially adversely affect us

allegations of conflicts of interest including in connection with accepting market derived income ‘mdi’ may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or reputation

we could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest conflicts of interest exist or could exist any time the company or any of its employees have or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests this could occur for example when the company is providing services to 

 

multiple parties in connection with a transaction in addition as we provide more solutionsbased services there is greater potential for conflicts with advisory services managing conflicts of interest is an important issue for the company but can be a challenge for a large and complex company such as ours due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base we regularly address potential conflicts of interest including without limitation situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client if these are not carefully managed this could then lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests with attendant regulatory and reputational risks that could materially adversely affect us and our operations there is no guarantee that all potential conflicts of interest will be identified and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our professional reputation and result in legal liability which may have a material adverse effect on our business identifying conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult as we continue to bring systems and information together and integrate newly acquired businesses in addition we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest 

in addition insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of placements we make for clients or by fees paid by clients intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers this revenue when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets as opposed to as corporate clients of the intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other nonmarketrelated services is commonly known as market derived income or ‘mdi’ mdi is another example of an area in which allegations of conflicts of interest may arise mdi takes a variety of forms including volume or profitbased contingent commissions facilities administration charges business development agreements and fees for providing certain data to carriers

mdi creates various risks intermediaries in many markets have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ or their own interests ahead of their clients accordingly mdi may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest antitrust unfair competition conduct and antibribery laws and regulations while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice and while we have established systems and controls to manage these risks we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be effective

in addition the company offers affiliated investment funds with plans to launch additional funds over time given that our investment business may recommend affiliated investment funds or affirmatively invest such clients’ assets in such funds under delegated authority there may be a perceived conflict of interest while the company has processes procedures and controls in place intended to mitigate potential conflicts such perception could cause regulatory inquiries or could impact client demand and the business’ financial performance and our controls may not be effective in addition underperformance by our affiliated investment funds could lead to lawsuits by clients that were invested in such funds

the failure or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions conflicts of interest may also arise in the future that could cause material harm to us

damage to our reputation including due to the failure of third parties on whom we rely to perform services or public opinions of third parties with whom we associate could adversely affect our businesses

maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with clients and colleagues damage to our reputation could therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory action failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures allegations of conflicts of interest and unethical behavior such harm could also arise from negative public opinion or political conditions arising from our association with third parties in any number of activities or circumstances negative perceptions or publicity whether or not true may result in harm to our prospects in addition the failure to deliver satisfactory service and quality performance on time and within budget in one line of business could cause clients to terminate the services we provide to those clients in many other lines of business this risk has increased as the company has become larger and more complex and as we take on increasingly complicated projects for our clients such as complex outsourcing engagements and technology solutions developmentimplementation projects that require a significant amount of dedicated personnel resources and expenses 

in addition as part of providing services to clients and managing our business we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers our ability to perform effectively depends in part on the ability of these service providers to meet their obligations as well as on our effective oversight of their performance the quality of our services could suffer or we could be required to incur unanticipated costs if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as expected or their services are disrupted this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation as well as our business and results of operations 

 

the loss of key colleagues could damage or result in the loss of client relationships and could result in such colleagues competing against us 

our success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including key managers and colleagues in addition our success largely depends upon our colleagues’ abilities to generate business and provide quality services in particular our colleagues’ business relationships with our clients are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements labor markets have continued to tighten globally and we have experienced intense competition and increased costs for certain types of colleagues especially as new entrants in insurance and reinsurance businesses among others expend significant resources in hiring also in the past and following the announcement of the proposed aon combination we have lost colleagues who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise if we lose additional colleagues such as those it could result in such colleagues competing against us the failure to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel could materially adversely affect our ability to secure and complete engagements or could disrupt our business which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology data and analytics to drive value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology analytics and related tools 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology data and analytic solutions that anticipate lead or keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology both for internal operations and for maintaining industry standards and meeting client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely and costeffective manner or in attracting and maintaining personnel with the necessary skills in this area additionally our ideas may not lead to the desired internal efficiencies or be accepted in the marketplace in addition we may not be able to implement technologybased solutions as quickly as desired if for example greater resources are required than originally expected or resources are otherwise needed elsewhere the effort to gain technological and data expertise and develop new technologies or analytic techniques in our business requires us to incur significant cost and attract qualified technical talent who are in high demand our competitors are seeking to develop competing or new technologies and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions in certain cases we may decide based on perceived business needs to make investments that may be greater than we currently anticipate if we cannot offer new technologies or data and analytic services or solutions as quickly or effectively as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or analytic tools it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements 

our business may be harmed by any negative developments that may occur in the insurance industry or if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers 

many of our businesses are heavily dependent on the insurance industry any negative developments that occur in the insurance industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations in addition if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers it may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

the private health insurance industry in the us has experienced a substantial amount of consolidation over the past several years resulting in a decrease in the number of insurance carriers in the future it may become necessary for us to offer insurance plans from a reduced number of insurance carriers or to derive a greater portion of our revenue from a more concentrated number of carriers as our business and the health insurance industry continue to evolve the termination amendment or consolidation of our relationships with our insurance carriers could harm our business results of operations and financial condition

legal nonfinancialtax regulatory and compliance risks 

our inability to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations related to data privacy and cyber security could result in material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the us and foreign jurisdictions only certain of which are named here designed to protect the personally identifiable information of client and company constituents and suppliers notably the european union’s general data protection regulation ‘gdpr’ and the california consumer privacy act and its implementing regulations ‘ccpa’ we are also subject to regulations from other countries that prohibit or restrict the transmission of data outside of such countries’ borders and to various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health financial or other individually identifiable information the gdpr which became effective in may 2018 as well as other more recentlyenacted privacy laws significantly increased our responsibilities when handling personal data including without limitation requiring us to conduct privacy impact assessments restricting the transmission of data and requiring public disclosure of significant data breaches violations of the gdpr may result in possible fines of up to 4 of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million whichever is higher a recent judgment by the court of justice of the european union on schrems ii has made cross border data transfers to 

 

organizations outside the european economic area more onerous and uncertain pending definitive guidance by european union authorities further as a result of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union ‘brexit’ the data transfer regime between the uk and the european economic area is governed by the euuk trade and cooperation agreement while this agreement provides an interim data transfer regime that replicates the european union’s existing rules there is still some uncertainty regarding applicable laws and regulations once the interim arrangement ends on may 1 2021 or july 1 2021 if extended the company is also subject to numerous us and foreign marketing and telecommunications laws and regulations designed to protect consumers from unwanted or fraudulent communications a violation of any such law may lead to litigation or regulatory liability including substantial financial damages or fines 

laws and regulations in this area are evolving and generally becoming more stringent including without limitation the us health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ‘hipaa’ enforced by the office for civil rights within the department of health and human services and the new york state department of financial services’ cybersecurity regulations outlining required security measures for the protection of data certain us states have also recently enacted laws requiring certain data security and privacy measures of regulated entities notably the ccpa we expect that both other us states and other countries will follow in implementing their own data privacy and data security laws for example brazil recently enacted the lei geral de proteção de dados pessoais a national data protection law modeled on the gdpr the people’s republic of china and india among other countries are also expected to enact data protection laws that could among other things restrict data transfers out of each of those countries 

each of these evolving laws and regulations in the united states and abroad as well as laws applicable to the company that are not named here may be subject to evolving and conflicting interpretations restrict the manner in which we provide services to our clients divert resources from other important initiatives increase the risk of noncompliance impose significant compliance and other costs that are likely to increase over time and increase the risk of fines lawsuits or other potential liability all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our failure to adhere to or successfully develop processes in response to legal or regulatory requirements including legal or regulatory requirements that may be developed or revised due to economic or geopolitical changes such as brexit and changing customer expectations in this area could result in substantial legal liability and impairment to our reputation or business

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal regulatory cultural market operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal regulatory market operational and other risks our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets the possible effects of political economic financial and climate change related disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses and financial results these risks include

















 

sanctions imposed by governments or changes to such sanction regulations could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial results 

as described above our businesses are subject to the risk of sanctions imposed by the us the eu the uk and other governments in 2020 there was an increase in us designations in locations such as china russia and venezuela in recent years there has also been an increased risk of countersanctions in some locations such as russia in addition the uk government is expected to bring in a new uk sanctions regime following brexit under the sanctions and antimoney laundering act 2018 although it is expected that the new uk sanctions regulations will replicate the eu regulations through statutory instruments without significant changes nevertheless it is not yet clear whether and how these sanctions or potential sanctions may impact our business as a result we cannot predict the impacts of any changes in the us eu uk or other sanctions and whether such changes could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial results 

our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government laws or regulations or if government laws or regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs

a material portion of our revenue is affected by statutory or regulatory changes an example of a statutory or regulatory change that could materially impact us is any change to the us patient protection and affordable care act ‘ppaca’ and the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 ‘hcera’ which we refer to collectively as ‘healthcare reform’ while the us congress has not passed legislation replacing or fundamentally amending healthcare reform other than changes to the individual mandate such legislation or another version of healthcare reform could be implemented in the future in addition some us political candidates and representatives elected to office in the recent election have expressed a desire to amend all or a portion of healthcare reform or otherwise establish alternatives to employersponsored health insurance or replace it with governmentsponsored health insurance often referred to as ‘medicare for all’ furthermore various aspects of healthcare reform have been challenged in the judicial system with some success the status of some of those challenges are in flux but could materially change us healthcare if we are unable to adapt our services to potential new laws and regulations or judicial modifications with respect to healthcare reform or otherwise our ability to provide effective services in these areas may be substantially impacted in addition more restrictive rules or interpretations of the centers for medicare and medicaid services marketing rules or judicial decisions that restrict or otherwise change existing provisions of us healthcare regulation could have a material adverse impact on our benefits delivery and administration business  including our recently acquired tranzact business which focuses on directtoconsumer medicare policy sales as we implement and expand our directtoconsumer sales and marketing solutions through our benefits delivery and administration business we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations that prescribe when and how we may market to consumers including without limitation the telephone consumer protection act and other telemarketing laws and the medicare communications and marketing guidelines issued by the center for medicare services of the us department of health and human service  changes to these laws could negatively affect our ability to market directly to consumers or increase our costs or liabilities 

many other areas in which we provide services are the subject of government regulation which is constantly evolving for example our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services are subject to regulation and supervision by national state or other authorities insurance laws in the markets in which we operate are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the markets in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these locations

changes in government and accounting regulations in the us and the uk two of our principal geographic markets affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human capital programs may materially adversely affect the demand for or the profitability of our various services in addition we have significant operations throughout the world which further subject us to applicable laws and regulations of countries outside the us and the uk changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators in particular countries including changes in administration and enforcement policies could require operational improvements or modifications which may result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business in those countries 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we comply with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the us the uk the eu and its member states and the other jurisdictions around the world in which we operate in addition we own an interest in a number of associates and companies where we do not exercise management control over the last few years regulators across the world are increasingly seeking to regulate brokers who operate in their jurisdictions the foreign and us laws and regulations applicable to our operations are complex continually evolving and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business 

 

to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings these laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations antitrust and competition laws economic and trade sanctions laws relating to countries in which certain subsidiaries do business or may do business ‘sanctioned jurisdictions’ such as crimea cuba iran russia sudan syria and venezuela anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act 2010 and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us as well as laws and regulations related to data privacy cyber security and telemarketing because of changes in regulation and company practice our nonus subsidiaries are providing more services with connections to various countries including some sanctioned jurisdictions that our us subsidiaries are unable to perform 

in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies monetary fines injunctions revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients while we believe that we have substantially increased our focus on the geographic breadth of regulations to which we are subject maintain good relationships with our key regulators and our current systems and controls are adequate we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of any applicable laws and regulations while we strive to remain fully compliant with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot guarantee that we will fully comply at all times with all laws and regulations especially in countries with developing or evolving legal systems or with evolving or extraterritorial regulations in particular given the challenges of integrating operations many of which are decentralized we cannot assure that acquired or decentralized entities’ business systems and controls have prevented or will prevent any and all violations of applicable laws or regulations 

changes and developments in the health insurance system in the united states could harm our business

in 2010 the federal government enacted significant reforms to healthcare legislation through healthcare reform many of our lines of business depend upon the private sector of the us insurance system its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use of and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance plans healthcare reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the industry in which we operate in substantial ways any changes to the roles of the private and public sectors in the health insurance system could also substantially change the industry

certain key members of congress have expressed a desire to replace or amend all or a portion of healthcare reform in addition various aspects of healthcare reform have been challenged in the judicial system with some success any partial or complete repeal or amendment judicial modifications or implementation difficulties or uncertainty regarding such events could increase our costs of compliance prevent or delay future adoption or revisions to our exchange platform and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition other members of congress have otherwise expressed a desire to establish alternatives to employersponsored health insurance or replace it with governmentsponsored health insurance often referred to as ‘medicare for all’ given the uncertainties relating to the potential repeal and replacement of healthcare reform or other alternative proposals related to health insurance plans especially from the new presidential administration the impact is difficult to determine but it could have material negative effects on us including













any of these effects could materially harm our business and results of operations for example the manner in which the federal government and the states implement health insurance exchanges and the process for receiving subsidies and costsharing credits could substantially increase our competition and member turnover and substantially reduce the number of individuals who purchase insurance through us various aspects of healthcare reform could cause insurance carriers to limit the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell and the geographies in which we are able to sell them in addition the us congress may seek to find spending cuts and such cuts may include medicare if cuts are made to medicare there may be substantial changes in the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell especially through our recently acquired tranzact business which focuses on directtoconsumer medicare policy sales changes in the law could also cause insurance carriers to exit the business of selling insurance plans 

 

in a particular jurisdiction to eliminate certain categories of products or to attempt to move members into new plans for which we receive lower commissions if insurance carriers decide to limit our ability to sell their plans or determine not to sell individual health insurance plans altogether our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed 

limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and our ability to compete effectively  and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others

we cannot guarantee that trade secret trademark and copyright law protections or our internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property including our software which may become an increasingly important part of our business existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights also we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot be sure that our services and products or the products of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients these claims may harm our reputation result in financial liability consume financial resources to pursue or defend and prevent us from offering some services or products in addition these claims whether with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s focus and resources from business operations successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

the laws of ireland differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states

financial and related regulatory including tax risks 

we have material pension liabilities that can fluctuate significantly and adversely affect our financial position or net income or result in other financial impacts

we have material pension liabilities some of which represent unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement liabilities movements in the interest rate environment investment returns inflation or changes in other assumptions that are used to estimate our benefit obligations and other factors could have a material effect on the level of liabilities in these plans at any given time most pension plans have minimum funding requirements that may require material amounts of periodic additional funding and accounting requirements that may result in increased pension expense for example in 2018 we were required to recognize a £ 31 million 40 million pension settlement expense related to the accelerated recognition of certain accumulated losses in one of our uk pension schemes following the transfer out of assets of certain plan participants depending on the above factors among others we could be required to recognize further pension expense in the future increased pension expense could adversely affect our earnings or cause earnings volatility in addition the need to make additional cash contributions may reduce our financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or other needs of our business 

 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility  and we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 

willis towers watson had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 56 billion as of december 31 2020 and our interest expense was 244 million for the year ended december 31 2020

although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may







the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments the operating restrictions and financial covenants in our credit facilities do and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default or a crossdefault under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that is not cured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

the maintenance and growth of our business depends on our access to capital which will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing also we could be at risk to rising interest rates in the future to the extent that we borrow at floating rates under our existing borrowing agreements or refinance existing debt at higher rates there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on us 

a downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility and under certain circumstances may require us to offer to buy back some of our outstanding debt

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources

in addition under the indenture for our 3600 senior notes due 2024 our 4625 senior notes due 2023 our 6125 senior notes due 2043 our 3500 senior notes due 2021 our 4400 senior notes due 2026 our 2125 senior notes due 2022 our 4500 senior notes due 2028 our 5050 senior notes due 2048 our 2950 senior notes due 2029 and our 3875 senior notes due 2049 if we experience a ratings decline together with a change of control event we would be required to offer to purchase these notes from holders unless we had previously redeemed those notes we may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

if a us person is treated as owning at least 10 of our shares such a holder may be subject to adverse us federal income tax consequences

as a result of us tax reform many of our nonus subsidiaries are now classified as ‘controlled foreign corporations’ ‘cfcs’ for us federal income tax purposes due to the expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules within a multinational corporate group if a us person is treated as owning directly indirectly or constructively at least 10 of the value or voting power of our shares such a person may be treated as a us shareholder with respect to one or more of our cfc subsidiaries in addition if our shares are treated as owned more than 50 by us shareholders we would be treated as a cfc a us shareholder of a cfc may be required to annually report and include in its us taxable income as ordinary income its prorata share of subpart f income 

 

global intangible lowtaxed income and investments in us property by cfcs whether or not we make any distributions to such us shareholder an individual us shareholder generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a corporate us shareholder with respect to a cfc a failure by a us shareholder to comply with its reporting obligations may subject the us shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may extend the statute of limitations with respect to the us shareholder’s us federal income tax return for the year for which such reporting was due we cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our nonus subsidiaries are cfcs or whether any investor is a us shareholder with respect to any such cfcs we also cannot guarantee that we will furnish to us shareholders any or all of the information that may be necessary for them to comply with the aforementioned obligations us investors should consult their own advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments in us 

legislative or regulatory action in the us or abroad could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate

we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from expectations and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the ‘us tax reform’ which generally became effective on january 1 2018 the us tax reform included numerous changes to existing tax law including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 among other things us tax reform could cause us to lose the benefit of certain tax credits and deductions limit our ability to deduct interest incurred in the us and potentially increase our income taxes due to the base erosion and antiabuse tax ‘beat’ the us treasury department has issued a number of proposed regulations clarifying some of the provisions of the us tax reform many of which are still ongoing we will continue to evaluate the overall impact of us tax reform and related regulations on our operations and tax position over the next twelve months the us tax reform could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

further the new presidential administration may propose and implement significant changes to the us tax policies and legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely or otherwise affect the taxes that the us imposes on our worldwide operations regulations or administrative guidance from the us treasury department that are currently proposed or newly issued in the future could have similar consequences such changes could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant additional expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that have the effect of limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise experience business detriment

in addition the us congress the organisation for economic cooperation and development ‘oecd’ the world trade organization and other government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of base erosion and profit shifting where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates in october 2015 the oecd released final reports addressing fifteen specific actions as part of a comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting although the timing and methods of implementation vary several jurisdictions have enacted legislation that is aligned with and in some cases exceeds the scope of the oecd’s recommendations as a result the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various other risks that could impact our business

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside of the us accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or us dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws additionally and as noted above the unknown impacts of brexit may expose us to additional exchange rate fluctuations in the pounds sterling

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are 

 

almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside of the us and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in local currencies 

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenue and expenses together with any net pounds sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollardenominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure while we do utilize hedging strategies to attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective 

changes in accounting principles or in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us gaap any change to accounting principles particularly to us gaap could have a material adverse effect on us or our results of operations 

us gaap accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to revenue recognition valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients discretionary compensation incurredbutnotreported liabilities restructuring pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates and changes in accounting standards could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations

in addition we have a substantial amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed and we significantly increased goodwill as a result of the merger we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

our quarterly revenue and cash flow could fluctuate including as a result of factors outside of our control while our expenses may remain relatively fixed or be higher than expected

quarterly variations in our revenue cash flow and results of operations have occurred in the past and could occur as a result of a number of factors such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter seasonality of certain types of services the number of business days in a quarter colleague hiring and utilization rates our clients’ ability to terminate engagements without penalty the size and scope of assignments our ability to enhance our billing collection and working capital management efforts and general economic conditions

we derive significant revenue from commissions for brokerage services but do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in the premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission levels may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenue and operating margin we could be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions in addition insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as us the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability

a sizeable portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed or may even be higher than expected encompassing the majority of administrative occupancy communications and other expenses depreciation and amortization and salaries and employee benefits excluding fiscal yearend incentive bonuses therefore a variation in the number of client assignments and collection of accounts receivable or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments or our inability to forecast demand can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results and could result in losses and volatility in our stock price 

 

it is unclear how increased regulatory oversight and changes in the method for determining the london interbank offered rate ‘libor’ may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to libor or how such changes could affect our results of operations or financial condition 

in the recent past concerns have been publicized regarding the calculation of libor the london interbank offered rate which present risks for the financial instruments that use libor as a reference rate libor is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the london interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally 

accordingly uncertainty as to the nature of such changes may affect the market for or pricing of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations in addition any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor which could have an impact on the market for or pricing of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us including our revolving credit facility or on our overall financial condition or results of operations for example on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 currently there is not an agreement on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor however the alternative reference rate committee in the us comprised of a group of large banks and other financial institutions selected the secured overnight finance rate ‘sofr’ as an alternative to libor in may 2018 the federal reserve bank of new york began to publish the alternative rate sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by treasury securities furthermore as of april 23 2018 the bank of england has commenced publication of a reformed sterling overnight index average ‘sonia’ comprised of a broader set of overnight sterling money market transactions the sonia has been recommended as the alternative to sterling libor by the uk working group on sterling riskfree reference rates at this time it is not possible to predict whether and how these alternative reference rates will become accepted alternatives to libor or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders for repurchasing shares of common stock and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries for example willis limited our uk brokerage subsidiary regulated by the fca is currently required to maintain 140 million in unencumbered and available financial resources of which at least 51 million must be in cash for regulatory purposes in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on or repurchase shares of common stock

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate

 item 2 properties

we operate offices in many countries throughout the world and believe that our properties are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used the principal properties are located in the united states and the united kingdom in addition we have other offices in various locations including among others europe asia australia and latin america operations of each of our segments are carried out in owned or leased offices under operating leases that typically do not exceed 10 years in length except for certain properties in key locations we do not anticipate difficulty in meeting our space needs at lease expiration

share data 

our ordinary shares began trading on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol ‘wltw’ on january 5 2016 as of february 18 2021 there were 1165 shareholders of record of our shares

dividends 

we normally pay dividends on a quarterly basis to shareholders of record on march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 in february 2021 the board of directors is expected to approve a regular quarterly cash dividend of 071 per common share the dividend is expected to be payable on or about april 15 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 31 2021

there are no governmental laws decrees or regulations in ireland that restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to nonresident holders of the company’s shares

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the united states should be exempt from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from irish dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends

with respect to noncorporate us shareholders certain dividends from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradeable on an established securities market in the united states such as our shares noncorporate us shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as investment income pursuant to section 163d4 of the code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation in addition the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances

executive overview

market conditions

within our insurance and brokerage business the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission revenue may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating margin a ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our revenue and operating margin rates however vary by geography industry and client segment as a result and due to the global and diverse nature of our business we view rates in the aggregate overall we are currently seeing a modest but definite improvement with pricing in the market

market conditions in the broking industry in which we operate are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world insurance rate movements and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients 

the markets for our consulting technology and solutions and marketplace services are affected by economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors we believe that the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs in that regard we are focused on developing and implementing technology data and analytic solutions for both internal operations and for maintaining industry standards and meeting client preferences we have made such investments from time to time and may decide based on perceived business needs to make investments in the future that may be greater than we currently anticipate conversely particularly given the impact of the covid19 pandemic we may make fewer information technologybased investments than previously anticipated which could potentially create business operational risk

with regard to the market for exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform part of the employersponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase as these market segments continue to evolve we may experience growth in intervals with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth in recent years growth in the market for exchanges has slowed and we expect this trend may continue

following the occurrence of brexit and the end of the formal transition period on december 31 2020 a trade agreement has been established between the uk and eu as expected the agreement largely addresses goods and not services and the company has therefore completed the establishment of appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business in all relevant eu countries it is anticipated that further negotiations will ensue between the uk and eu in order to address matters related to services including financial services though the outcome of such discussions and potential impact on the company are not yet known for a further discussion of the risks of brexit to the company see part i item 1a risk factors within this annual report on form 10k 

 

typically our business benefits from regulatory change political risk or economic uncertainty insurance broking generally tracks the economy but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty we have some businesses such as our health and benefits and administration businesses which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change 

although approximately 21 of our revenue is generated in the uk on an annual basis about 12 of revenue is denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 20 of our expenses is denominated in pounds sterling thus we generally benefit from a weakening pound sterling in our income from operations however we have a company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency

see part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k for discussions of risks that may affect our ability to compete

proposed combination with aon plc

on march 9 2020 the company and aon issued an announcement disclosing that they had signed a business combination agreement pursuant to which the company will be acquired by aon the transaction remains subject to various customary closing conditions including required antitrust and other regulatory approvals the parties expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2021 subject to satisfaction of these conditions the transaction also subjects the company to various incremental risks both before closing and after the transaction is potentially closed see ‘business – the company’ and ‘risk factors – combinationrelated risks’

risks and uncertainties of the covid19 pandemic

the covid19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on global commercial activity including the global supply chain and has contributed to significant volatility in the global financial markets including among other effects occasional declines in the equity markets changes in interest rates and reduced liquidity on a global basis in light of the effects on our own business operations and those of our clients suppliers and other third parties with whom we interact the company has regularly considered the impact of covid19 on our business taking into account our business resilience and continuity plans financial modeling and stress testing of liquidity and financial resources 

generally the covid19 pandemic did not have a material adverse impact on our overall financial results during 2020 however during 2020 the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our revenue growth primarily in our businesses that are discretionary in nature we believe such level of impact will continue through much of 2021 at least until a sufficient portion of the populations in jurisdictions where we do business have been vaccinated and socialdistancing orders are lessened or lifted 

as part of the significant estimates and assumptions that are inherent in our financial statements we have considered the impact covid19 will have on our client behavior and the economic environment looking forward to 2021 and throughout the geographies in which we operate these estimates and assumptions include the collectability of billed and unbilled receivables the estimation of revenue and the fair value of our reporting units tangible and intangible assets and contingent consideration with regard to collectability of receivables we believe we may continue to face atypical delays in client payments going forward the demand for certain discretionary lines of business has decreased and we believe that decrease may continue to impact our financial results in succeeding periods nondiscretionary lines of business have also been to some extent adversely affected and may be adversely affected in the future further reduced economic activity or disruption in insurance markets could reduce the demand for or the extent of insurance coverage for example we have seen instances where the reduced demand for air travel has reduced the extent of insurance coverage needed also the increased frequency and severity of coverage disputes between our clients and reinsurers arising out of the pandemic could increase our professional liability risk we will continue to monitor the situation and assess any implications to our business and our stakeholders 

the extent to which covid19 impacts our business and financial position will depend on future developments which are difficult to predict these future developments may include the severity and scope of the covid19 outbreak which may unexpectedly change or worsen and the types and duration of measures imposed by governmental authorities to contain the virus or address its impact we continue to expect that the covid19 pandemic will negatively impact our revenue and operating results in fiscal 2021 we believe that these trends and uncertainties are similar to those faced by other comparable registrants as a result of the pandemic see also part i item 1a risk factors for a discussion of actual and potential impacts of covid19 on our business clients and operations

daily operations  we continue to closely monitor the spread and impact of covid19 while adhering to government health directives including the availability of vaccines the company continues to have restrictions on business travel office access meetings and events but is actively developing its returntowork plans with a focus on safe utilization based on appropriate socialdistancing guidelines we have thorough business continuity and incident management processes in place that have been activated including split team operations and workfromhome protocols for essential workers which continue to be globally effective we are communicating frequently with clients and critical vendors while meeting our objectives via remote working capabilities overseen 

 

and coordinated by our incident management response team while no contingency plan can eliminate all risk of temporary service interruption we regularly assess and update our plans to help m itigate reasonable risk s to the extent possible  

financial statement overview

the tables below set forth our summarized consolidated statements of comprehensive income and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated for management’s discussion of our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 in comparison with the year ended december 31 2018 please see our annual report on form 10k filed with the sec on february 26 2020

consolidated statements of comprehensive income

 in millions except per share data



consolidated revenue

we derive the majority of our revenue from commissions from our brokerage services and fees for consulting and administration services no single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenue for any of our three most recent fiscal years

the following table details our top five markets based on percentage of consolidated revenue in us dollars from the countries where work was performed for the year ended december 31 2020 these figures do not represent the currency of the related revenue which is presented in the next table



 

the table below details the percentage of our revenue and expenses by transactional currency for the year ended december 31 2020  



 



the following table sets forth the total revenue for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 and the components of the change in total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year

 



 



revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 was 94 billion compared to 90 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 an increase of 313 million or 3 on an asreported basis adjusting for the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions and disposals our organic revenue growth was 2 for the year ended december 31 2020 the crb irr and bda segments had organic revenue growth during the year while the hcb segment was flat in part due to the impact of the covid19 reduction in demand for our discretionary services the revenue from acquisitions related primarily to tranzact which generated revenue of 557 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 245 million for the year ended december 31 2019 which represents revenue included from the date of the acquisition of july 30 2019

our revenue can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year for the year ended december 31 2020 currency translation decreased our consolidated revenue by 10 million the primary currency driving this change was the brazilian real

definitions of constant currency change and organic change are included in the section entitled ‘nongaap financial measures’ elsewhere within this form 10k

segment revenue

we manage our business across four reportable operating segments human capital and benefits corporate risk and broking investment risk and reinsurance and benefits delivery and administration

segment revenue excludes amounts that were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and reimbursed by them reimbursed expenses however these amounts are included in consolidated revenue

the company experiences seasonal fluctuations in its revenue revenue is typically higher during the company’s first and fourth quarters due primarily to the timing of brokingrelated activities 

impact of the covid19 pandemic on our segments

the covid19 pandemic has had and is projected to continue to have an impact on certain of our service offerings these impacts which primarily affect our revenue have been negative in some instances and positive in others and may in the future be material in either event in addition the potential negative impacts on our results may lag behind the developments to date related to the covid19 pandemic we have thus far seen the impact of covid19 primarily on our business offerings that are discretionary in nature such as consultative project work which spans our segments but primarily affected our hcb segment however most of the services we provide including broking for various insurance products compliance and valuation services risk mitigation and outsourced administration for both pension and health and welfare plans are considered nondiscretionary to our clients and recurring in nature we have seen that these nondiscretionary businesses are the least impacted of our offerings and while we expect that trend to continue our nondiscretionary businesses may be adversely affected due to changing demands in the market

 

we expect to continue to experience unpredictable volatility in demand around our discretionary services and solutions clients may defer or delay decisionmaking or planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements for these discretionary services and solutions 

we recognize that the broad global nature of the covid19 crisis has impacted the liquidity of our clients generally and caused us to not meet our original growth estimates for the year we continue to monitor the global outbreak of the covid19 pandemic and take steps to mitigate the risks to us posed by its spread by working with our clients colleagues suppliers and other stakeholders due to the global breadth of the covid19 spread and the range of governmental and community reactions thereto there is ongoing uncertainty around its duration severity ultimate impact and the timing of recovery we believe the pandemic will continue to cause an extended disruption on economic activity in 2021 and the impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows could be material meanwhile although we cannot predict how long this situation will last we continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet liquidity and financial flexibility

human capital and benefits 

the hcb segment provides an array of advice broking solutions and software for our clients

hcb is the largest segment of the company generating approximately 35 of our segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 hcb is focused on addressing our clients’ people and risk needs to help them take on the challenges of operating in a global marketplace this segment is further strengthened with teams of international consultants who provide support through each of our business units to the global headquarters of multinational clients and their foreign subsidiaries

benefit delivery and administration 

the bda segment provides primary medical and ancillary benefit exchange and outsourcing services to active employees and retirees across both the group and individual markets a significant portion of the revenue in this segment is recurring in nature driven by either the commissions from the policies we sell in our employerbased medicare broking business or from longterm service contracts with our clients that typically range from three to five years revenue across this segment may be seasonal driven by the magnitude and timing of client enrollment activities which often occur during the fourth quarter with increased membership levels typically effective january 1 after calendar yearend benefits elections on july 30 2019 the company acquired tranzact which 

 

operates as part of the bda segment tranzact experiences seasonally higher revenue during the fourth quarter due primarily to the timing of the federal medicare open enrollment window

note 14 — commitments and contingencies within item 8 in this annual report on form 10k partially offset by lower travel and entertainment marketing and occupancy costs during the year

amortization

amortization represents the amortization of acquired intangible assets including acquired internallydeveloped software amortization for the year ended december 31 2020 was 462 million compared to 489 million for the year ended december 31 2019 a decrease of 27 million or 6 our intangible amortization is more heavily weighted to the initial years of the useful lives of the related intangibles and therefore amortization related to intangible assets purchased prior to our acquisition of tranzact will continue to decrease over time this decrease was partially offset by the additional amortization resulting from the intangible assets related to the tranzact acquisition

restructuring costs

restructuring costs for the year ended december 31 2020 were 24 million all of which related to minor restructuring activities carried out by various business lines throughout the company there were no restructuring costs incurred for the year ended december 31 2019

other income net

other income net for the year ended december 31 2020 was 399 million compared to 227 million for the year ended december 31 2019 an increase of 172 million the increase resulted from the net gains on disposals of operations primarily due to the disposal of our max matthiessen business see note 3 – acquisitions and divestitures within item 8 in this annual report on form 10k and higher pension income in the current year 

provision for income taxes

provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2020 was 318 million compared with 249 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 were 238 and 188 respectively these effective tax rates are calculated using extended values from our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are therefore more precise tax rates than can be calculated from rounded values the current year effective tax rate is higher primarily due 

 

to additional tax expense of 61 million in connection with the temporary income tax provisions of the cares act during 2020 the company elected to utilize the higher section 163j 50 percent business interest limitation for tax years 2019 and 2020  which allows the company to utilize additional interest expense the utilization of additional interest expense re duces our regular tax liability and reduces our ability to utilize foreign tax credits  however it creates a base erosion minimum tax expense for these tax years the base erosion and antiabuse t ax ‘ beat ’ effectively applies a 10 percent minimum tax if modified taxable income as adjusted for base erosion payments is greater than the regular tax liability for a year  

net income attributable to willis towers watson

liquidity and capital resources

executive summary

our principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities and any new debt offerings subject to the limitations set forth in the aon combination agreement these sources of liquidity will fund our shortterm and longterm obligations at december 31 2020 our most significant longterm obligations include mandatory debt and related interest operating leases and pension obligations and contributions to our qualified pension plans 

during 2020 the covid19 pandemic contributed to significant volatility in financial markets including occasional declines in equity markets changes in interest rates and reduced liquidity on a global basis specific to willis towers watson the covid19 pandemic has had and we believe will continue to have a negative impact on discretionary work we perform for our clients we also believe this may continue to impact future cash collections from clients particularly those in certain harderhit industries we have also reduced our spending on travel and associated expenses and thirdparty contractors and we have the ability to reduce spending on discretionary projects and certain capital expenditures

based on our current balance sheet and cash flows current market conditions and information available to us at this time we believe that willis towers watson has access to sufficient liquidity which includes all of the borrowing capacity available to draw against our 125 billion revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months including investing in the business for growth scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments in early 2021 we settled 210 million of obligations related to the stanford and willis towers watson mergerrelated securities litigations and we currently anticipate that the 500 million of 5750 senior notes maturing in the first quarter of 2021 and related interest will be repaid in full using our current cash and cash equivalents balances 

during the year ended december 31 2020 the company together with its whollyowned subsidiary willis north america inc as issuer completed an offering of an additional 275 million aggregate principal amount of 2950 senior notes due 2029 willis north america inc previously issued 450 million aggregate principal amount in september 2019 all of which remains outstanding net proceeds of 280 million excluding accrued interest on this recent offering from march 15 2020 to but not including may 29 2020 of 2 million payable to us on such date were used to repay 175 million of the full principal amount and related accrued interest under our term loan facility which was set to expire in july 2020 as well as repay 105 million of borrowings outstanding under our 125 billion revolving credit facility and related accrued interest

events that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results potential future acquisitions or divestitures material changes in geographic sources of cash unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets

tax considerations  the company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when it expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments we continue to have certain subsidiaries whose earnings have not been deemed permanently reinvested for which we have been accruing estimates of the tax effects of such repatriation excluding these certain subsidiaries we continue to assert that the historical cumulative earnings for the remainder of our subsidiaries have been reinvested indefinitely and therefore do not provide deferred taxes on these amounts if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital longterm investment requirements or additional legislation relating to us tax reform necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for income and foreign withholding taxes net of credits may be necessary other potential sources of cash may be through the settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a taxefficient manner 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 and 2019 totaled 21 billion and 887 million respectively 

additionally we had all of the borrowing capacity available to draw against our 125 billion revolving credit facility at both december 31 2020 and 2019

included within cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 and 2019 are amounts held for regulatory capital adequacy requirements including 88 million and 114 million respectively held within our regulated uk entities at december 31 2020 and 2019

the notes issued by the parent company willis north america and trinity acquisition plc









all other subsidiaries of the parent company are nonguarantor subsidiaries ‘the nonguarantor subsidiaries’ 

each member of the obligor group has only a stockholder’s claim on the assets of the nonguarantor subsidiaries this stockholder’s claim is junior to the claims that creditors have against those nonguarantor subsidiaries holders of the notes will only be creditors of the obligor group and not creditors of the nonguarantor subsidiaries as a result all of the existing and future liabilities of the nonguarantor subsidiaries including any claims of trade creditors and preferred stockholders will be structurally senior to the notes as of and for the periods ended december 31 2020 and 2019 the nonguarantor subsidiaries represented substantially all of the total assets and accounted for substantially all of the total revenue of the company prior to consolidating adjustments the nonguarantor subsidiaries have other liabilities including contingent liabilities that may be significant each indenture does not contain any limitations on the amount of additional debt that the obligor group and the nonguarantor subsidiaries may incur the amounts of this debt could be substantial and this debt may be debt of the nonguarantor subsidiaries in which case this debt would be effectively senior in right of payment to the notes 

the notes are obligations exclusively of the obligor group substantially all of the obligor group’s operations are conducted through its nonguarantor subsidiaries therefore the obligor group’s ability to service its debt including the notes is dependent upon the net cash flows of its nonguarantor subsidiaries and their ability to distribute those net cash flows as dividends loans or other payments to 

 

the obligor group certain laws restrict the ability of these nonguarantor subsidiaries to pay dividends and make loans and advances to the obligor group in addition such nonguarantor subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements that limit their ability to pay dividends and make loans and advances to the obligor group

our us gaap tax rates were 238 and 188 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the current year effective tax rate is higher primarily due to tax expense of 61 million recognized in connection with the temporary income tax provisions of the cares act during 2020 the company elected to utilize the higher section 163j 50 percent business interest limitation for tax years 2019 and 2020 which allows the company to utilize additional interest expense the utilization of additional interest expense reduces our regular tax liability and reduces our ability to utilize foreign tax credits however it creates a base erosion minimum tax expense for these tax years the beat effectively applies a 10 percent minimum tax if modified taxable income as adjusted for base erosion payments is greater than the regular tax liability for a year

our adjusted income tax rates were 208 and 203 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the current year adjusted income tax rate is higher than the prior year due to an enacted statutory tax rate change in the uk requiring us to remeasure our uk deferred tax liabilities and recognize a deferred tax expense of 11 million

free cash flow

free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use free cash flow is a liquidity measure and is not meant to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures

the favorable movement in free cash flows in 2020 was primarily due to positive cash flows from our improved working capital position driven by effective management of discretionary spending for the year ended december 31 2020  our free cash flows in 2020 were partially offset by transaction and integration expenses primarily related to the combination with aon 

critical accounting policies and estimates

revenue recognition 

we use significant estimates related to revenue recognition most commonly during our estimation of the transaction prices or where we recognize revenue over time on a proportional performance basis a brief description of these policies and estimates is included below

estimation of transaction prices — this process occurs most frequently in certain broking transactions in situations in which our fees are not fixed but are variable we must estimate the likely commission per policy taking into account the likelihood of cancellation before the end of the policy for medicare broking affinity arrangements and proportional treaty reinsurance broking the commissions to which we will be entitled can vary based on the underlying individual insurance policies that are placed for medicare broking and proportional treaty reinsurance in particular we base the estimates of transaction prices on supportable evidence from an analysis of past transactions and only include amounts that are probable of being received or not refunded referred to as applying ‘constraint’ under asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  in our directtoconsumer medicare broking arrangements the estimate of the total renewal commissions that will be received over the lifetime of the policy requires significant judgment and will vary based on product type estimated commission rates the expected lives of the respective policies and other factors the company has applied an actuarial model to account for these uncertainties which is updated periodically based on actual experience each of these processes result in us estimating a transaction price that may be significantly lower than the ultimate amount of commissions we may collect the transaction price is then adjusted over time as we receive confirmation of our remuneration through receipt of commissions or as other information becomes available 

proportional performance basis over time recognition — where we recognize revenue on a proportional performance basis primarily in our consulting and outsourced administration arrangements the amount we recognize is affected by a number of factors that can change the estimated amount of work required to complete the project such as the staffing on the engagement andor the level of client participation our periodic engagement evaluations require us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stages of project completion that in turn affect how we recognize revenue we recognize a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than the total estimated costs associated with the engagement losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 

costs to fulfill broking contracts 

for our broking business the company must estimate the fulfillment costs incurred during the preplacement of the broking contracts these judgments include the following









 

valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from a client’s failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered which are recorded in other operating expenses we also maintain allowances related to our unbilled receivables for such items as expected realization or client disputes the related provision for which is recorded as a reduction to revenue our allowance policy is based in part on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on our writeoff history however facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due general market conditions at the time we perform the work current economic trends and our clients’ ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables

discretionary compensation

our compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year after our annual operating results are finalized

an estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted if necessary by management to reflect changes in the forecast of prebonus profitability for the year our estimated annual profitability coupled with the projected seasonality inherent in our business represent significant estimates during our interim quarterly close process 

income taxes

the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the change is enacted deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as based on available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company adjusts valuation allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amounts considered realizable in future periods when the company’s facts and assumptions change in making such determinations the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operating results we place more reliance on evidence that is objectively verifiable

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities

we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance and the provision of consulting services in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice in certain cases where a range of loss exists we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount

see note 14 — commitments and contingencies in item 8 within this annual report on form 10k

pension assumptions

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in several countries with the most significant defined benefit plans offered in the us and uk our disclosures in note 12 — retirement benefits contain additional information about our other less significant but material retirement plans within our critical accounting policy discussion we have excluded analysis for plans outside of those noted in the description below as any variance of recorded information based on management’s estimates would be immaterial

descriptions of our us and uk plans which comprise 90 of our projected benefit obligations and 93 of our plan assets are below

united states

legacy willis – this plan was frozen in 2009 approximately onequarter of the legacy willis employees in the united states have a frozen accrued benefit under this plan

 

willis towers watson plan – substantially all us employees are eligible to participate in this plan benefits are provided under a stable value pension plan design the original stable value design came into effect on january 1 2012 existing plan participants prior to july 1 2017 earn benefits without having to make employee contributions and all newly eligible employees after that date are required to contribute 2 of pay on an aftertax basis to participate in the plan 

united kingdom

legacy willis – this plan covers approximately onequarter of the legacy willis employees in the united kingdom the plan is now closed to new entrants new employees in the united kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan

legacy towers watson – benefit accruals earned under the legacy watson wyatt defined benefit plan predominantly pension benefits ceased on february 28 2015 although benefits earned prior to january 1 2008 retain a link to salary until the employee leaves the company benefit accruals earned under the legacy towers perrin defined benefit plan predominantly lump sum benefits were frozen on march 31 2008 all participants now accrue defined contribution benefits

legacy miller – the plan provides retirement benefits based on members’ salaries at the point at which they ceased to accrue benefits under the scheme

the determination of the company’s obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that given the longevity of the plans are longterm in focus a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation however certain of these changes such as changes in the discount rates and other actuarial assumptions are not recognized immediately in net income but are instead recorded in other comprehensive income the accumulated gains and losses not yet recognized in net income are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit costincome over the average remaining service period or average remaining life expectancy as appropriate of the plan’s participants to the extent that the net gains or losses as of the beginning of the year exceed 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation

willis towers watson considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions including economic forecasts relevant benchmarks historical trends portfolio composition and peer company comparisons these assumptions used to determine our pension liabilities and pension expense are reviewed annually by senior management and changed when appropriate a discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas an expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longerterm trends in asset returns emerge or longterm target asset allocations are revised to calculate the discount rate we use the granular approach to determining service cost and interest cost the expected rate of return assumptions for all plans are supported by an analysis of the weightedaverage yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality and the expected longterm rates of compensation and pension increases

funding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes or as agreed to with the plan trustees for the uk plans since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes pension contributions are not equal to net periodic benefit cost

we recorded a combined 201 million net periodic benefit income for our us and uk plans for the year ended december 31 2020 for the us and uk plans the following table presents our estimated net periodic benefit income for 2021 and the impact to both plans of a 025 increase and decrease to both the expected return on assets ‘eroa’ and the discount rate assumptions and the projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2020 and the impact of a 025 increase and decrease to the discount rates

 



 

 

economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously  and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

goodwill and intangible assets — impairment review

in applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with the remainder recorded as goodwill intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise the fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise

goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and the company had eight reporting units as of october 1 2020

during fiscal year 2020 the company performed the impairment test for all reporting units each of the reporting unit’s estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values and we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill to perform the test we used valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit that are under the income andor market approaches of valuation methods under the discounted cash flow method an income approach the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debtfree aftertax cash flows for a finite period of years key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management assessment of business risk and expected rates of return on capital the guideline company method a market approach develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies key estimates and determination of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies obtaining forecast revenue and ebitda estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics under the similar transactions method a market approach actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units are used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

financial risk management

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 — basis of presentation significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements and note 9 — derivative financial instruments within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

foreign exchange risk

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the us we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earn revenue in several currencies but incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenue and expenses by currency in 2020

 



 

 

 



our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from







london market operations

the company’s primary foreign exchange risks in its london market operations arise from changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and pound sterling as its london market operations earn the majority of its revenue in us dollars but incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling and may also hold significant foreign currency asset or liability positions on its consolidated balance sheet in addition the london market operations earn significant revenue in euro and japanese yen

the foreign exchange risks in our london market operations are hedged to the extent that







 

intercompany lending between subsidiaries 

the company engages in intercompany borrowing and lending between subsidiaries primarily through our inhouse banking operations which give rise to foreign exchange exposures the company mitigates these risks through the use of shortterm foreign currency forward and swap transactions that offset the underlying exposure created when the borrower and lender have different functional currencies these derivatives are not generally designated as hedging instruments and at december 31 2020 we had notional amounts of 15 billion denominated primarily in us dollars pound sterling euro and australian dollars with net fair value assets of 15 million such derivatives typically mature within three months 

translation risk

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenue and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weightedaverage contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within two years

 



 

 



income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the uk is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency however the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities

interest rate risk

the company has access to 125 billion under a revolving credit facility expiring march 7 2022 as of december 31 2020 no amount was drawn on this facility we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in us dollars pounds sterling and euros

 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 

 



 

 







interest income on fiduciary funds

as a result of our operating activities we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies we earn interest on these funds which is included in our consolidated financial statements as interest income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity at december 31 2020 we held 22 billion of fiduciary funds invested in interestbearing accounts if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 25 basis points interest earned on these invested fiduciary funds and therefore our interest income recognized would increase or decrease by approximately 6 million on an annualized basis

liborrelated debt instruments 

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced its intention to phase out libor as a benchmark rate by the end of 2021 the alternative reference rates committee ‘arrc’ a group of privatemarket participants convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york to help ensure a successful transition from us dollar libor ‘usdlibor’ to a more robust reference rate has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate ‘sofr’ represents the best alternative to usdlibor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to usdlibor arrc has proposed a transition plan with specific steps and timelines designed to encourage the adoption of sofr and guide the transition to sofr from usdlibor organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to usdlibor similar efforts are underway to identify suitable replacement reference rates for libor in other major currencies 

as of december 31 2020 the company’s primary exposure is its 125 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2022 and its collateralized facility assumed as part of its acquisition of tranzact which are both priced using rates tied to libor we anticipate renegotiating the revolving credit facility prior to the potential libor quotation termination date and will renegotiate or repay the collateralized facility prior to the end of 2021 in addition the company and its subsidiaries have entered into various intercompany notes indexed to libor the company in preparation for a december 31 2021 deadline expects to amend or replace the liborbased intercompany notes as necessary to reflect new market benchmarks for the relevant loan currencies 

we are currently evaluating the liborrelated risks that may be inherent in our treasury workstation software and elsewhere in our business and are monitoring for further proposals and guidance from the arrc and other alternativerate initiatives while it is currently uncertain whether sofr or another reference rate will be selected as the alternative to libor or whether other reforms will be enacted in response to the planned transition we will make the appropriate changes when necessary

credit risk and concentrations of credit risk

credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted the company currently does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties the company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk

concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents fiduciary funds accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value

 

the company maintains a policy of providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure these financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the company does business as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas management does not believe that significant risk exists in connection with the company’s concentrations of credit as of december 31 2020

competition

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with accenture plc aon plc arthur j gallagher  co brown  brown inc cognizant technology solutions corporation marsh  mclennan companies inc ‘marsh  mclennan’ and robert half international inc as well as with numerous specialty regional and local firms marsh  mclennan and aon plc are two of the largest providers of global risk management services competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and in some business lines marsh  mclennan and aon plc have greater market share than we do

competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures have arisen and are expected to continue to arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms new brokers and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services

 

the human capital and risk management consulting industries are highly competitive we believe there are significant barriers to entry and we have developed competitive advantages in providing hr consulting and risk management consulting services we face strong competition from several sources 

our principal competitors in the pension consulting industry are mercer hr consulting a marsh  mclennan company and aon plc beyond these large players the global hr consulting industry is highly fragmented

our major competitors in the insurance consulting and software industry include milliman oliver wyman a marsh  mclennan company the big four accounting firms and sungard aon buck consultants an hig capital company connextions a united healthcare company mercer a marsh  mclennan company automatic data processing and fidelity are our primary competitors in the insurance exchange industry with the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act we also compete with the public exchanges currently run by the us federal and state governments we compete with providers of accountbased health plans and consumerdirected benefits such as wageworks and healthequity

the market for our services is subject to change as a result of economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors regulatory and legislative actions along with continuously evolving technological developments will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products we believe the primary factors in selecting an hr consulting or risk management services firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs with regard to the marketplace for individuals and active employee exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings a strong reputation for efficient execution a provider’s capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments and an innovative service delivery model and platform for our traditional consulting and risk management services and the rapidly evolving exchange products we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors

 item 1a risk factors

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements these risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business the descriptions below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown to us could also impair our business operations financial condition or results if any of the risks and uncertainties below or other risks were to occur our business operations financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted with respect to the taxrelated consequences of acquisition ownership and disposal of ordinary shares you should consult with your own tax advisors 

strategic and operational risks 

our success largely depends on our ability to achieve our global business strategy as it evolves and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer if the company were unable to successfully establish and execute on its strategy and generate anticipated revenue growth and cost savings and efficiencies

our future growth profitability and cash flows largely depend upon our ability to successfully establish and execute our global business strategy as discussed under item 1 ‘business  business strategy’ we seek to be an advisory broking and solutions provider of choice through an integrated global platform while we have confidence that our strategic plan reflects opportunities that are appropriate and achievable there is a possibility that our strategy may not deliver projected longterm growth in revenue and profitability due to inadequate execution incorrect assumptions global or local economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we operate suboptimal resource allocation or any of the other risks described in this ‘risk factors’ section in addition our strategy continues to evolve and it is possible that we will be unable to successfully execute the associated strategy changes due to factors discussed above or elsewhere in this ‘risk factors’ section in pursuit of our growth strategy we may also invest significant time and resources into new product or service offerings and there is the possibility that these offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment the failure to continually develop and execute optimally on our global business strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

demand for our services could decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn increased competition or a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or prospects all of which could materially adversely affect us 

we can give no assurance that the demand for our services will grow or be maintained or that we will compete successfully with our existing competitors new competitors or our clients’ internal capabilities client demand for our services may change based on the clients’ needs and financial conditions among other factors

our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve for example any changes in us trade policy including any increases in tariffs that result in a trade war ongoing stock market volatility or an increase in  or unmet market expectations with respect to interest rates could adversely affect the general economy as a result global financial markets may continue to experience disruptions including increased volatility and reduced credit availability which could substantially impact our results likewise the coronavirus emanating from china could have a material adverse impact on global demand from our clients in addition to the potential impact of pandemics on our own operations discussed elsewhere in this report while it is difficult to predict the consequences of any deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing our services or insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the potential for a significant insurer to fail be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenue and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients

in addition the markets for our principal services are highly competitive our competitors include other insurance brokerage including directtoconsumer medicare brokerage human capital and risk management consulting and actuarial firms and the human capital and risk management divisions of diversified professional services insurance brokerage and accounting firms and specialty regional and local firms

competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and some competitors have greater market share in certain lines of business than we do some of our competitors have greater financial technical and marketing resources than us which could enhance their ability to finance acquisitions fund internal growth and respond more quickly to professional and technological changes new competitors as well as increasing and evolving consolidation or alliances among existing competitors have created and could continue to create additional competition and could significantly reduce our market share resulting in a loss of business for us and a corresponding decline in revenue and profit margin in order to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure we may have to lower our prices which would also have an adverse effect on our revenue and profit margin

in addition existing and new competitors could develop competing technologies or product or service offerings that disrupt our industries any new technology or product or service offering including insurance companies selling their products directly to consumers or other insureds that reduces or eliminates the need for intermediaries in insurance or reinsurance sales transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further the increasing willingness of clients to either selfinsure or maintain a captive insurance company and the development of capital marketsbased solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs could also materially adversely affect us and our results of operations

an example of a business that may be significantly impacted by changes in customer demand is our retirement consulting and actuarial business which comprises a substantial portion of our revenue and profit we provide clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans defined benefit pension plans generally require more actuarial services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools complex calculations to determine employer costs funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate or if we are unable to otherwise compensate for the decline in our business that results from employers moving away from defined benefit plans our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected furthermore large and complex consulting projects often involving dedicated personnel resources and expenses comprise a significant portion of this business which are based on our clients’ discretionary needs and may be reduced based on a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or prospects we also face the risk that certain large and complex project contracts may be reduced or terminated based on dissatisfaction with service levels which could result in reduced revenue writeoffs of assets associated with the project and disputes over the contract all of which may adversely impact our results and business

in addition the demand for many of our core benefit services including compliancerelated services is affected by government regulation and taxation of employee benefit plans significant changes in tax or social welfare policy or other regulations could lead 

 

some employers to discontinue their employee benefit plans including defined benefit pension plans thereby reducing the demand for our services a simplification of regulations or tax policy also could reduce the need for our services 

data security breaches or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could result in material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

we depend on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners insurance carriersmarkets and clients additionally one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their customers andor employees our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks we are the target of computer viruses hackers distributed denial of service attacks malware infections ransomware attacks phishing and spearphishing campaigns and other external hazards as well as improper or inadvertent staff behavior which could expose confidential company and personal data systems and information to security breaches

many of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from and supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors our thirdparty applications include enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services provided and maintained by thirdparty vendors these thirdparty applications store confidential and proprietary data of the company our employees and our clients we have processes designed to require thirdparty it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of compromising this data including as a result of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyberattack on a vendor’s information systems further the risk and potential impact of a data breach of our thirdparty vendors’ systems increase as we move more of our data and our clients’ data into our vendors’ cloud storage we engage in it outsourcing or we consolidate the group of thirdparty vendors that provide cloud storage or other it services for the company

we and our vendors regularly experience cybersecurity incidents including successful attacks from time to time and we expect that to continue going forward cybersecurity incidents also include those resulting from human error or malfeasance implantation of malware and viruses phishing and spearphishing attacks unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems and unauthorized access to data or individual account funds through fraud or other means of deceiving our colleagues thirdparty service providers and vendors we have experienced successful attacks by various types of hacking groups in which personal and commercially sensitive information belonging to us or our clients has been compromised however none of these cybersecurity incidents or attacks to our knowledge have been material to our business or financial results we cannot assure that such cybersecurity incidents or attacks will not be material in the future when required by law we have notified individuals and relevant regulatory authorities such as state attorney generals state insurance regulators the us department of health and human services and the uk’s information commissioner’s office of such cybersecurity incidents or attacks

over time the frequency severity and sophistication of the attacks against us have increased we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards such as where in place multifactor authentication and encryption of data in transit and at rest designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however such safeguards are timeconsuming and expensive to deploy broadly and are not necessarily always in place or effective and we cannot entirely   eliminate the risk of data security breaches improper access to takeover of or disclosure of confidential company or personally identifiable information we may not be able to detect and assess such issues or implement appropriate remediation in a timely manner we are engaged in an ongoing effort to enhance our protections against attack this effort will require significant expenditures and may not be successful our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we hold and protect it from theft computer viruses hackers or inadvertent loss

if any person including any of our colleagues intentionally or unintentionally fails to comply with disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines regulatory enforcement or criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client supplier or employee data whether through systems failure accident employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our colleagues or third parties could result in significant additional expenses including expenses relating to incident response and investigation remediation work notification of data security breaches and costs of credit monitoring services negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation as well as require substantial resources and effort of management thereby diverting management’s focus and resources from business operations

the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving continue to become more sophisticated and complex and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for example the cyber division of the us federal bureau of investigation ‘fbi’ has noted that cyber criminals have targeted and may increasingly target 

 

assets held in health savings accounts and reimbursement accounts to fraudulently acquire the assets held in those accounts assets held in health savings accounts are expected to grow substantially over the next few years we have experienced incidents in which unauthorized actors compromised personal information including through the use of unlawfully obtained demographic information these incidents have not had a material impact on our business or operations thus far but  given the company’s move toward managing more of these assets ourselves as a nonbank c ustodian our reputation could be harmed and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we were the target of such fraud in the future 

we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against fraud or unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss the everevolving threats mean that we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate adapt enhance and otherwise improve our respective systems and processes especially as we grow our mobile cloud and other internetbased services there is no guarantee that such efforts will be adequate to safeguard against all fraud data security breaches unauthorized access operational impacts or misuses of data for example our policies employee training including phishing prevention training procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential personal or proprietary information by employees vendors or other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems in addition we may not be able to implement such efforts as quickly as desired if for example greater resources are required than originally expected or resources and management’s focus are insufficient any future significant compromise or breach of our data security or fraud whether external or internal or misuse of client colleague supplier or company data could result in additional significant costs lost revenue opportunities fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation with our clients and in the broader market

we could be subject to claims and lawsuits arising from our work which could materially adversely affect our reputation business and financial condition

we depend in large part on our relationships with clients and our reputation for highquality services to secure future engagements clients that become dissatisfied with our services may terminate their business relationships with us and clients and third parties that claim they suffered damages caused by our services may bring lawsuits against us we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the provision of our services or the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims see note 15  commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k for examples of claims to which we are subject

because we often assist our clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money and complex regulatory requirements including actuarial services asset management technology solutions development and implementation and the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may arise that allege our potential liability for all or part of the substantial amounts in question the nature of our work particularly our actuarial services necessarily involves the use of assumptions and the preparation of estimates relating to future and contingent events the actual outcome of which we cannot know in advance our actuarial and brokerage services also rely on substantial amounts of data provided by clients the accuracy and quality of which we may not be able to ensure in addition we could make computational software programming or data management errors in connection with the services we provide to clients

clients may seek to hold us responsible for alleged errors or omissions relating to any of the brokerage advice and services we provide including when claims they submit to their insurance carriers are disputed or denied given that many of our clients have very high insurance policy limits to cover their risks alleged errors and omissions claims against us arising from disputed or denied claims are often significant moreover in certain circumstances our brokerage investment and certain other types of business may not limit the maximum liability to which we may be exposed for claims involving alleged errors or omissions and as such we do not have limited liability for the work we provide to the associated clients

further given that we frequently work with large pension funds and insurance companies as well as other large clients relatively small percentage errors or variances can create significant financial variances and result in significant claims for unintended or unfunded liabilities the risks from such variances or errors could be aggravated in an environment of declining pension fund asset values and insurance company capital levels in almost all cases our exposure to liability with respect to a particular engagement is substantially greater than the revenue opportunity that the engagement generates for us

clients may seek to hold us responsible for the financial consequences of variances between assumptions and estimates and actual outcomes or for errors for example in the case of pension plan actuarial work a client’s claims might focus on the client’s alleged reliance on actuarial assumptions that it believes were unreasonable and based on such reliance the client made benefit commitments that it may later claim are not affordable or funding decisions that result in plan underfunding if and when actual outcomes vary from actuarial assumptions

 

we also continue to create new products and services including increasingly complex technology solutions and to grow the business of providing products and services to institutional investors financial services companies and other clients the risk of claims from these lines of business and related products and services may be greater than from our core products or services and such claims may be for significant amounts as we take on increasingly complicated projects including those with complex regulatory requirements 

we also provide advice on both asset allocation and selection of investment managers increasingly for many clients we are responsible for making decisions on both of these matters or we may serve in a fiduciary capacity either of which may increase liability exposure in addition the company offers affiliated investment funds including in the us and ireland with plans to launch additional funds over time given that our investment business may recommend affiliated investment funds or affirmatively invest such clients’ assets in such funds under delegated authority this may increase our liability exposure we may also be liable for actions of managers or other service providers to the funds further for certain clients we are responsible for some portions of cash and investment management including rebalancing of investment portfolios and guidance to third parties on the structure of derivatives and securities transactions asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and investment managers may underperform their benchmarks in both cases the investment return shortfall can be significant clients experiencing this underperformance including from our affiliated investment funds may assert claims against us and such claims may be for significant amounts in addition our failure to properly execute our role can cause monetary damage to our clients or such third parties for which we might be found liable and such claims may be for significant amounts our expected expansion of this business geographically and in new offerings will subject us to additional contractual exposures and obligations with investors asset managers and third party service providers as well as increased regulatory exposures overall our ability to contractually limit our potential liability may be limited in certain jurisdictions or markets or in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary duties or other alleged errors or omissions

the ultimate outcome of all of the above matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us in addition our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against such liabilities it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the industries we operate in or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships in addition defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs

as a highlyregulated company we are subject from time to time to inquiries or investigations by governmental agencies or regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations

we have also been and may continue to be subject to inquiries and investigations by federal state or other governmental agencies regarding aspects of our clients’ businesses or our own businesses especially regulated businesses such as our insurance broker securities brokerdealer and investment advisory services such inquiries or investigations may consume significant management time and result in regulatory sanctions fines or other actions as well as significant legal fees which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and liquidity also we may face additional regulatory scrutiny as we expand our businesses geographically and in new products and services that we offer

examples of these inquiries or investigations are set forth in more detail in note 15 — commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k these include various ongoing civil investigation proceedings in respect of alleged exchanges of commercially sensitive information among competitors in aviation and aerospace insurance and reinsurance broking

all of these items reflect an increased focus by regulators in the uk us and elsewhere on various aspects of the operations and affairs of our regulated businesses we are unable to predict the outcome of these inquiries or investigations any proposed changes that result from these investigations and inquiries or any other investigations inquiries or regulatory developments or any potential fines or enforcement action could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions and we face risks when we acquire or divest businesses and could have difficulty in acquiring integrating or managing acquired businesses or with effecting internal reorganizations all of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation 

our growth depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions we may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms acceptable or favorable to us we also face additional risks related to acquisitions including that we could overpay for acquired businesses and that any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to our expectations in addition we may not repurchase as many of our outstanding shares as anticipated due to our acquisition activity or investment opportunities as well as other market or business conditions if we are unable to identify and successfully make integrate and manage acquisitions our business could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks related to divesting businesses including that we may not receive adequate consideration in return for the divested business we may continue to be subject to the liabilities of the divested business after its divestiture including with respect to work we might have performed on behalf of the divested business and we may not be able to reduce overhead or redeploy assets or retain colleagues after the divestiture closes for example we recently announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives with respect to miller and we may face these types of risks if we were to pursue a transaction 

in addition we cannot be certain that our acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or that our acquisitions or divestitures will otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if the operating performance of an acquired business deteriorates significantly we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet

we may be unable to effectively integrate an acquired business into our organization and may not succeed in managing such acquired businesses or the larger company that results from such acquisitions the process of integrating an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks including without limitation an inability to retain the management key personnel and other employees of the acquired business an inability to establish uniform standards controls systems procedures and policies or to achieve anticipated savings and exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition

certain recentlycompleted or pending acquisitions including the acquisition on july 30 2019 of tranzact a usbased directtoconsumer health care organization that links individuals to us insurance carriers and the pending acquisition of unity group an insurance broking business with operations in six central american countries entail important incremental risks in addition to those described above with respect to our tranzact business we may be unable to successfully integrate directtoconsumer sales and marketing solutions with our existing offerings at the times and to the extent anticipated with respect to both transactions we face the risk related to the potential impacts of the transaction and integration on relationships including with employees correspondents suppliers clients and competitors as well as the risk related to contingent liabilities including litigation potentially creating material liabilities for the company with respect to the unity group we face the risk that we are unable to obtain requisite regulatory approvals or the satisfaction of other conditions to the consummation of the transaction on the proposed terms and schedule if at all the following risks in addition to those described above may also adversely affect our ability to successfully implement and integrate these acquisitions material changes in us and foreign jurisdiction regulations including those related to the healthcare system and medicare and insurance brokerage services changes in general economic business and political conditions in relevant markets including changes in the financial markets significant competition in the marketplace and compliance with extensive and evolving government regulations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 

if acquisitions are not successfully integrated and the intended benefits of the acquisitions are not achieved our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as well as our professional reputation we also own an interest in a number of associates and companies where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore limited in our ability to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we could achieve if we had full ownership 

our inability to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations related to data privacy and cyber security could result in material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect personally identifiable information of client and company constituents colleague supplier and company data such as the eu general data protection regulation ‘gdpr’ regulations from other countries that prohibit the transmission of data outside of such country’s borders and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health financial or other individually identifiable information gdpr which became effective in may 2018 significantly increased our responsibilities when handling personal data including without limitation requiring us to conduct privacy impact assessments restricting the transmission of data and requiring public disclosure of significant data breaches violations of gdpr may result in possible fines of up to 4 of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million whichever is higher laws and regulations in this area are evolving and generally becoming more stringent for 

 

example the new york state department of financial services has issued cybersecurity regulations that outline a variety of required security measures for protection of data other us states including california have also recently enacted laws requiring certain data security and privacy measures of regulated entities that are broadly similar to gdpr’s requirements and we expect that other states may follow with their own data privacy and data security laws as well  in the us hipaa has been in place for many years and was amended in 2009 to become more stringent the office for civil rights within the department of health and human services actively enforces those laws and regulations further a uk exit from the eu will increase uncertainty regarding applicable laws and regulations pending more clarity on the terms of that exit 

all of these evolving laws and regulations some of which may be subject to evolving interpretations or conflicts with one another may restrict the manner in which we provide services to our clients divert resources from other important initiatives increase the risk of noncompliance and impose significant compliance and other costs that are likely to increase over time and increase the risk of fines lawsuits or other potential liability all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to legal or regulatory requirements including changing legal or regulatory requirements that may be developed or revised due to brexit and changing customer expectations in this area could result in substantial legal liability and impairment to our reputation or business

our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational changes could impact our business results where the level of costs andor disruption may be significant and change over time and the benefits may be less than we originally expect 

we have in the past few years undergone several significant business and organizational changes including the merger the gras savoye acquisition and multiyear operational improvement programs among others there are also a number of other initiatives planned or ongoing to transform and update our systems and processes and gain efficiencies in addition our strategy continues to evolve and such evolution may result in further organizational changes as we may decide based on our perceived business needs to make investments that may be greater than we currently anticipate in connection with all these changes we may manage a number of largescale and complex projects such projects may include multiple and connected phases many of which may be dependent on factors that are outside of our control while we plan to undertake these types of large complex projects based on our determination that each is necessary or desirable for the execution of the company’s business strategy we cannot guarantee that the collective effect of all of these projects will not adversely impact our business or results of operations or that the benefits will be as we originally expect effectively managing these organizational changes including ensuring that they are implemented on schedule within budget and without interruption to the existing business or that transitions to new systems do not create significant control vulnerabilities during the period of transition is critical to retaining talent servicing clients and our business success overall many of the risks described herein increase during periods of significant organizational change the failure to effectively manage such risks could adversely impact our resources or business or financial results 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breach power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities access to data and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations

a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability particularly if any of these problems occur during peak times

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing hardware or systems could cause material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant financial and other resources to maintain and enhance existing systems develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards and to be at the forefront of a range of technology options relevant to our business

in addition many of the software applications including enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services that we use in our business are licensed from and supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors we are significantly increasing our use of such cloud services and expect this to continue over time these thirdparty applications store confidential and proprietary 

 

data of both the company and our clients a suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruptions that could adversely impact our business 

if the data we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer hardware applications or software systems or the loss of skilled people with the knowledge needed to operate older systems or if we experience cost overruns delays or other disruptions this could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability

the united kingdom’s exit from the european union on january 31 2020 and the risk that other countries may follow could adversely affect us

in 2019 approximately 21 of our revenue was generated in the uk although only about 12 of revenue was denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 20 of our expenses were denominated in pounds sterling it remains difficult to predict with any level of certainty the impact that brexit will have on the economy economic regulatory and political stability and market conditions in europe including in the uk or on the pound sterling euro or other european currencies but any such impacts and others we cannot currently anticipate could materially adversely affect us and our operations among other things we could experience lower growth in the region due to indecision by businesses holding off on generating new projects or due to adverse market conditions and reduced reported revenue and earnings because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars due to the fact that we translate revenue denominated in nonus currencies such as pounds sterling into us dollars for our financial statements in addition there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective

the british government and the eu continue to negotiate the terms of the uks future relationship with the eu while many separation issues have been resolved significant uncertainty remains it is also possible that the uk exits the eu in a potentially disruptive manner with no agreedupon future relationship the company is heavily invested in the uk through our businesses and activities if brexit negatively impacts the uk then it could have a material adverse impact on us in addition brexit may result in greater restrictions on business conducted between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities there is also uncertainty as to how the uks access to the eu single market and the wider trading legal regulatory tax social and labor environments especially in the uk and eu will be impacted including the resulting impacts on our business and that of our clients any such changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results for example any changes to the passporting or other regulations relating to doing business in various eu countries by relying on a regulatory permission in the uk or doing business in the uk by relying on a regulatory permission in an eu country could increase our costs of doing business or our ability to do so at this point we do not expect the current passporting regime to continue beyond the current transition period or any extension to its current expiration on december 31 2020 any such change or other change in regulations could increase our costs of doing business or in some cases affect our ability to do business and adversely impact our operations and financial results 

the risk remains that the uk will not have agreed to a comprehensive trade agreement with the eu or other countries by the time the transition period expires or that any such trade agreement makes no or inadequate provision for passporting or other matters relevant to our business operations we are currently in the process of establishing appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business in the countries expected to be most affected these arrangements include the transaction of certain businesses andor the movement of certain businesses outside of the uk however various significant risks remain including the following among others 













 



there is also a risk that other countries may decide to leave the eu we cannot predict the impact that any additional countries leaving the eu will have on us but any such impacts could materially adversely affect us

allegations of conflicts of interest including in connection with accepting market derived income ‘mdi’ may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or reputation

we could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest conflicts of interest exist or could exist any time the company or any of its employees have or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests this could occur for example when the company is providing services to multiple parties in connection with a transaction in addition as we provide more solutionsbased services there is greater potential for conflicts with advisory services managing conflicts of interest is an important issue for the company but can be a challenge for a large and complex company such as ours due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base we regularly address potential conflicts of interest including without limitation situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client if these are not carefully managed this could then lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests with attendant regulatory and reputational risks that could materially adversely affect us and our operations there is no guarantee that all potential conflicts of interest will be identified and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our professional reputation and result in legal liability which may have a material adverse effect on our business identifying conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult as we continue to bring systems and information together and integrate newly acquired businesses in addition we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest

in addition insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of placements we make for clients or by fees paid by clients intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers this revenue when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets as opposed to as corporate clients of the intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other nonmarket related services is commonly known as market derived income or ‘mdi’ mdi is another example of an area in which allegations of conflicts of interest may arise mdi takes a variety of forms including volume or profitbased contingent commissions facilities administration charges business development agreements and fees for providing certain data to carriers

mdi creates various risks intermediaries in many markets have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ or their own interests ahead of their clients accordingly mdi may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest antitrust unfair competition conduct and antibribery laws and regulations while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice and while we have established systems and controls to manage these risks we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be effective

in addition the company offers affiliated investment funds with plans to launch additional funds over time given that our investment business may recommend affiliated investment funds or affirmatively invest such clients’ assets in such funds under delegated authority there may be a perceived conflict of interest while the company has processes procedures and controls in place intended to mitigate potential conflicts such perception could cause regulatory inquiries or could impact client demand and the business’ financial performance and our controls may not be effective in addition underperformance by our affiliated investment funds could lead to lawsuits by clients that were invested in such funds

the failure or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions conflicts of interest may also arise in the future that could cause material harm to us

damage to our reputation including due to the failure of third parties on whom we rely to perform services or public opinions of third parties with whom we associate could adversely affect our businesses

maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with clients and colleagues damage to our reputation could therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory action failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures allegations of conflicts of interest and unethical behavior such harm could also arise from negative public opinion or political conditions arising from our association with third parties in any number of activities or circumstances negative perceptions or publicity whether or not true may result in harm to our prospects in addition the failure to deliver satisfactory service and quality performance on time and within budget in one line of business could cause clients to terminate the services we provide to those clients in many other lines of business this risk has increased as the company has become larger and more complex and as we take on increasingly complicated projects for our clients such as complex outsourcing engagements and 

 

technology solutions developmentimplementation projects that require a significant amount of dedicated personnel resources and expenses  

in addition as part of providing services to clients and managing our business we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers our ability to perform effectively depends in part on the ability of these service providers to meet their obligations as well as on our effective oversight of their performance the quality of our services could suffer or we could be required to incur unanticipated costs if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as expected or their services are disrupted this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation as well as our business and results of operations 

the loss of key colleagues could damage or result in the loss of client relationships and could result in such colleagues competing against us

our success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including key managers and colleagues in addition our success largely depends upon our colleagues’ abilities to generate business and provide quality services in particular our colleagues’ business relationships with our clients are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements labor markets have continued to tighten globally and we have experienced intense competition and increased costs for certain types of colleagues especially as new entrants in insurance and reinsurance businesses among others expend significant resources in hiring also in the past we have lost colleagues who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise if we lose additional colleagues such as those it could result in such colleagues competing against us the failure to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel could materially adversely affect our ability to secure and complete engagements or could disrupt our business which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal regulatory cultural market operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal regulatory market operational and other risks our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets the possible effects of political economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses and financial results these risks include

















sanctions imposed by governments or changes to such sanction regulations could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial results

as described above our businesses are subject to the risk of sanctions imposed by the us the eu and other governments in 2019 there was an increase in us designations in locations such as china russia and venezuela in recent years there has also been an increased risk of countersanctions in some locations such as russia nevertheless it is not yet clear whether and how these sanctions or potential sanctions may impact our business as a result we cannot predict the impacts of any changes in the us eu uk or other sanctions and whether such changes could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial results 

 

our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government laws or regulations or if government laws or regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs 

a material portion of our revenue is affected by statutory or regulatory changes an example of a statutory or regulatory change that could materially impact us is any change to the us patient protection and affordable care act ‘ppaca’ and the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 ‘hcera’ which we refer to collectively as ‘healthcare reform’ while the us congress has not passed legislation replacing or fundamentally amending healthcare reform other than changes to the individual mandate such legislation or another version of healthcare reform could be implemented in the future in addition some of us political candidates and representatives have expressed a desire to amend all or a portion of healthcare reform or otherwise establish alternatives to employersponsored health insurance or replace it with governmentsponsored health insurance often referred to as ‘medicare for all’ furthermore various aspects of healthcare reform have been challenged in the judicial system with some success the status of some of those challenges are in flux but could materially change us healthcare if we are unable to adapt our services to potential new laws and regulations or judicial modifications with respect to healthcare reform or otherwise our ability to provide effective services in these areas may be substantially impacted in addition more restrictive rules or interpretations of the centers for medicare and medicaid services marketing rules or judicial decisions that restrict or otherwise change existing provisions of us healthcare regulation could have a material adverse impact on our benefits delivery and administration business  including our newly acquired tranzact business which focuses on directtoconsumer medicare policy sales as we implement and expand our directtoconsumer sales and marketing solutions through our benefits delivery and administration business we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations that prescribe when and how we may market to consumers including without limitation the telephone consumer protection act and other telemarketing laws and the medicare communications and marketing guidelines issued by the center for medicare services of the us department of health and human service  changes to these laws could negatively affect our ability to market directly to consumers or increase our costs or liabilities 

many other areas in which we provide services are the subject of government regulation which is constantly evolving for example our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services are subject to regulation and supervision by national state or other authorities insurance laws in the markets in which we operate are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the markets in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these locations

changes in government and accounting regulations in the us and the uk two of our principal geographic markets affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human capital programs may materially adversely affect the demand for or the profitability of our various services in addition we have significant operations throughout the world which further subject us to applicable laws and regulations of countries outside the us and the uk changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators in particular countries including changes in administration and enforcement policies could require operational improvements or modifications which may result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business in those countries 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we comply with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the us the uk the eu and its member states and the other jurisdictions around the world in which we operate in addition we own an interest in a number of associates and companies where we do not exercise management control over the last few years regulators across the world are increasingly seeking to regulate brokers who operate in their jurisdictions the foreign and us laws and regulations applicable to our operations are complex continually evolving and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings these laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations antitrust and competition laws economic and trade sanctions laws relating to countries in which certain subsidiaries do business or may do business ‘sanctioned jurisdictions’ such as crimea cuba iran russia sudan syria and venezuela anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act 2010 and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us as well as laws and regulations related to data privacy cyber security and telemarketing because of changes in regulation and company practice our nonus subsidiaries are providing more services with connections to various countries including some sanctioned jurisdictions that our us subsidiaries are unable to perform

in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies monetary fines injunctions revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients while we believe that we have 

 

substantially increased our focus on the geographic breadth of regulations to which we are subject maintain good relationships with our key regulators and our current systems and controls are adequate we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of any applicable laws and regulations while we strive to remain fullycompliant with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot guarantee that we will fully comply at all times with all laws and regulations especially in countries with developing or evolving legal systems or with evolving or extraterritorial regulations in particular given the challenges of integrating o perations many of which are de centralized we cannot assure that acquired or decentralized entities’ business systems and controls have prevented or will prevent any and all violations of applicable laws or regulations 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology data and analytics to drive value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology analytics and related tools

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology data and analytic solutions that anticipate lead or keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology both for internal operations and for maintaining industry standards and meeting client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely and costeffective manner or in attracting and maintaining personnel with the necessary skills in this area additionally our ideas may not lead to the desired internal efficiencies or be accepted in the marketplace in addition we may not be able to implement technologybased solutions as quickly as desired if for example greater resources are required than originally expected or resources are otherwise needed elsewhere the effort to gain technological and data expertise and develop new technologies or analytic techniques in our business requires us to incur significant cost and attract qualified technical talent who are in high demand our competitors are seeking to develop competing or new technologies and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions in certain cases we may decide based on perceived business needs to make investments that may be greater than we currently anticipate if we cannot offer new technologies or data and analytic services or solutions as quickly or effectively as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or analytic tools it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements 

our business may be harmed by any negative developments that may occur in the insurance industry or if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers

many of our businesses are heavily dependent on the insurance industry any negative developments that occur in the insurance industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations in addition if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers it may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

the private health insurance industry in the us has experienced a substantial amount of consolidation over the past several years resulting in a decrease in the number of insurance carriers in the future it may become necessary for us to offer insurance plans from a reduced number of insurance carriers or to derive a greater portion of our revenue from a more concentrated number of carriers as our business and the health insurance industry continue to evolve the termination amendment or consolidation of our relationships with our insurance carriers could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes and developments in the health insurance system in the united states could harm our business

in 2010 the federal government enacted significant reforms to healthcare legislation through healthcare reform many of our lines of business depend upon the private sector of the us insurance system its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use of and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance plans healthcare reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the industry in which we operate in substantial ways any changes to the roles of the private and public sectors in the health insurance system could also substantially change the industry

the current administration and certain key members of congress have expressed a desire to replace or amend all or a portion of healthcare reform in addition various aspects of healthcare reform have been challenged in the judicial system with some success any partial or complete repeal or amendment judicial modifications or implementation difficulties or uncertainty regarding such events could increase our costs of compliance prevent or delay future adoption or revisions to our exchange platform and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition some us political candidates and representatives have otherwise expressed a desire to establish alternatives to employersponsored health insurance or replace it with governmentsponsored health insurance often referred to as ‘medicare for all’ given the uncertainties relating to the potential repeal and replacement of healthcare reform or other alternative proposals related to health insurance plans the impact is difficult to determine but it could have material negative effects on us including



 











any of these effects could materially harm our business and results of operations for example the manner in which the federal government and the states implement health insurance exchanges and the process for receiving subsidies and costsharing credits could substantially increase our competition and member turnover and substantially reduce the number of individuals who purchase insurance through us various aspects of healthcare reform could cause insurance carriers to limit the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell and the geographies in which we are able to sell them in addition the us congress may seek to find spending cuts and such cuts may include medicare if cuts are made to medicare there may be substantial changes in the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell especially through our recentlyacquired tranzact business which focuses on directtoconsumer medicare policy sales changes in the law could also cause insurance carriers to exit the business of selling insurance plans in a particular jurisdiction to eliminate certain categories of products or to attempt to move members into new plans for which we receive lower commissions if insurance carriers decide to limit our ability to sell their plans or determine not to sell individual health insurance plans altogether our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed 

limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and our ability to compete effectively  and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others

we cannot guarantee that trade secret trademark and copyright law protections are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property including our software which may become an increasingly important part of our business existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights also we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot be sure that our services and products or the products of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients these claims may harm our reputation result in financial liability consume financial resources to pursue or defend and prevent us from offering some services or products in addition these claims whether with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s focus and resources from business operations successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 

financial and tax risks 

we have material pension liabilities that can fluctuate significantly and adversely affect our financial position or net income or result in other financial impacts

we have material pension liabilities some of which represent unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement liabilities movements in the interest rate environment investment returns inflation or changes in other assumptions that are used to estimate our benefit obligations and other factors could have a material effect on the level of liabilities in these plans at any given time most pension plans have minimum funding requirements that may require material amounts of periodic additional funding and accounting requirements that may result in increased pension expense for example in 2018 we were required to recognize a £ 31 million 40 million pension settlement expense related to the accelerated recognition of certain accumulated losses in one of our uk pension schemes following the transfer out of assets of certain plan participants depending on the above factors among others we could be required to recognize further pension expense in the future increased pension expense could adversely affect our earnings or cause earnings volatility in addition the need to make additional cash contributions may reduce our financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or other needs of our business 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility and we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all

willis towers watson had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 56 billion as of december 31 2019 and our interest expense was 234 million for the year ended december 31 2019

although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may







the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments the operating restrictions and financial covenants in our credit facilities do and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default or a crossdefault under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that is not cured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

the maintenance and growth of our business depends on our access to capital which will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing also we could be at risk to rising interest rates in the future to the extent that we borrow at floating rates under our existing borrowing agreements or refinance existing debt at higher rates there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on us 

a downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility and under certain circumstances may require us to offer to buy back some of our outstanding debt

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources

 

in addition under the indenture for our 3600 senior notes due 2024 our 4625 senior notes due 2023 our 6125 senior notes due 2043 our 3500 senior notes due 2021 our 4400 senior notes due 2026 our 2125 senior notes due 2022 our 4500 senior notes due 2028 our 5050 senior notes due 2048 our 2950 senior notes due 2029 and our 3875 senior notes due 2049 if we experience a ratings decline together with a change of control event we would be required to offer to purchase these notes from holders unless we had previously redeemed those notes we may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

if a us person is treated as owning at least 10 of our shares such a holder may be subject to adverse us federal income tax consequences

as a result of us tax reform many of our nonus subsidiaries are now classified as ‘controlled foreign corporations’ ‘cfcs’ for us federal income tax purposes due to the expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules within a multinational corporate group if a us person is treated as owning directly indirectly or constructively at least 10 of the value or voting power of our shares such a person may be treated as a us shareholder with respect to one or more of our cfc subsidiaries in addition if our shares are treated as owned more than 50 by us shareholders we would be treated as a cfc a us shareholder of a cfc may be required to annually report and include in its us taxable income as ordinary income its prorata share of subpart f income global intangible lowtaxed income and investments in us property by cfcs whether or not we make any distributions to such us shareholder an individual us shareholder generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a corporate us shareholder with respect to a cfc a failure by a us shareholder to comply with its reporting obligations may subject the us shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may extend the statute of limitations with respect to the us shareholder’s us federal income tax return for the year for which such reporting was due we cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our nonus subsidiaries are cfcs or whether any investor is a us shareholder with respect to any such cfcs we also cannot guarantee that we will furnish to us shareholders any or all of the information that may be necessary for them to comply with the aforementioned obligations us investors should consult their own advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments in us 

legislative or regulatory action in the us or abroad could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate

we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from expectations and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the ‘us tax reform’ which generally became effective on january 1 2018 the us tax reform included numerous changes to existing tax law including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 among other things us tax reform could cause us to lose the benefit of certain tax credits and deductions limit our ability to deduct interest incurred in the us and potentially increase our income taxes due to the base erosion and antiabuse tax the us treasury department has issued a number of proposed regulations clarifying some of the provisions of the us tax reform many of which are still ongoing we will continue to evaluate the overall impact of us tax reform and related regulations on our operations and tax position over the next twelve months our expectations of the impact of us tax reform are also subject to change possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretation or assumptions andor updated regulatory guidance the us tax reform could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

further legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely or otherwise affect the taxes that the us imposes on our worldwide operations regulations or administrative guidance from the us treasury department that are currently proposed or newly issued in the future could have similar consequences such changes could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant additional expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that have the effect of limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise experience business detriment

in addition the us congress the organisation for economic cooperation and development ‘oecd’ the world trade organization and other government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of base erosion and profit shifting where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates in october 2015 the oecd released final reports addressing fifteen specific actions as part of a comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of 

 

international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting although the timing and methods of implementation vary several jurisdictions have enacted legislation that is aligned with and in some cases exceeds the scope of the oecd’s recommendations as a result the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various other risks that could impact our business

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside of the us accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or us dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws additionally and as noted above the unknown impacts of brexit may expose us to additional exchange rate fluctuations in the pounds sterling

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside of the us and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in local currencies

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenue and expenses together with any net pounds sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollardenominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure while we do utilize hedging strategies to attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective 

changes in accounting principles or in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us gaap any change to accounting principles particularly to us gaap could have a material adverse effect on us or our results of operations 

us gaap accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to revenue recognition valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients discretionary compensation incurredbutnotreported liabilities restructuring pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates and changes in accounting standards could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations

in addition we have a substantial amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed and we significantly increased goodwill as a result of the merger we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

our quarterly revenue and cash flow could fluctuate including as a result of factors outside of our control while our expenses may remain relatively fixed or be higher than expected

quarterly variations in our revenue cash flow and results of operations have occurred in the past and could occur as a result of a number of factors such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter seasonality of certain types of services the number of business days in a quarter colleague hiring and utilization rates our clients’ ability to terminate engagements without penalty the size and scope of assignments our ability to enhance our billing collection and working capital management efforts and general economic conditions

 

we derive significant revenue from commissions for brokerage services but do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in the premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission levels may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenue and operating margin we could be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions in addition insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as us the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

a sizeable portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed or may even be higher than expected encompassing the majority of administrative occupancy communications and other expenses depreciation and amortization and salaries and employee benefits excluding fiscal yearend incentive bonuses therefore a variation in the number of client assignments and collection of accounts receivable or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments or our inability to forecast demand can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results and could result in losses and volatility in our stock price 

it is unclear how increased regulatory oversight and changes in the method for determining the london interbank offered rate ‘libor’ may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to libor or how such changes could affect our results of operations or financial condition

in the recent past concerns have been publicized regarding the calculation of libor the london interbank offered rate which present risks for the financial instruments that use libor as a reference rate libor is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the london interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally 

accordingly uncertainty as to the nature of such changes may affect the market for or pricing of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations in addition any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor which could have an impact on the market for or pricing of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us including our revolving credit facility or on our overall financial condition or results of operations for example on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 currently there is not an agreement on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor however the alternative reference rate committee in the us comprised of a group of large banks and other financial institutions selected the secured overnight finance rate ‘sofr’ as an alternative to libor in may 2018 the federal reserve bank of new york began to publish the alternative rate sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by treasury securities furthermore as of april 23 2018 the bank of england has commenced publication of a reformed sterling overnight index average ‘sonia’ comprised of a broader set of overnight sterling money market transactions the sonia has been recommended as the alternative to sterling libor by the uk working group on sterling riskfree reference rates at this time it is not possible to predict whether and how these alternative reference rates will become accepted alternatives to libor or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted

the laws of ireland differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states

 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders for repurchasing shares of common stock and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries for example willis limited our uk brokerage subsidiary regulated by the fca is currently required to maintain 140 million in unencumbered and available financial resources of which at least 79 million must be in cash for regulatory purposes in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on or repurchase shares of common stock

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate

share data 

our ordinary shares began trading on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol ‘wltw’ on january 5 2016 as of february 21 2020 there were approximately 1211 shareholders of record of our shares

dividends 

we normally pay dividends on a quarterly basis to shareholders of record on march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 on february 26 2020 the board of directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of 068 per common share the dividend is payable on or about april 15 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 31 2020

there are no governmental laws decrees or regulations in ireland that restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to nonresident holders of the company’s shares

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the united states should be exempt from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from irish dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends

with respect to noncorporate us shareholders certain dividends from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradeable on an established securities market in the united states such as our shares noncorporate us shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as investment income pursuant to section 163d4 of the code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation in addition the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances

market conditions 

due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission revenue may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating margin a ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our revenue and operating margin rates however vary by geography industry and client segment as a result and due to the global and diverse nature of our business we view rates in the aggregate overall we are currently seeing a modest but definite improvement with pricing in the market

market conditions in the broking industry in which we operate are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world insurance rate movements and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients 

the terms of brexit and its impact remain uncertain and the company is currently in the process of establishing appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business in the countries expected to be most affected for a further discussion of the risks of brexit to the company see part i item 1a risk factors within this annual report on form 10k

typically our business benefits from regulatory change political risk or economic uncertainty insurance broking generally tracks the economy but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty we have some businesses such as our health and benefits and administration businesses which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change

although approximately 21 of our revenue is generated in the uk on an annual basis only about 12 of revenue is denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 20 of our expenses is denominated in pounds sterling thus we generally benefit from a weakening pound sterling in our income from operations however we have a company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency

the markets for our consulting technology and solutions and marketplace services are affected by economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors we believe that the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs in that regard we are focused on developing and implementing technology data and analytic solutions for both internal operations and for maintaining industry standards and meeting client preferences we have made such investments from time to time and may decide based on perceived business needs to make investments in the future that may be greater than we currently anticipate 

with regard to the market for exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform part of the employersponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase as these market segments continue to evolve we may experience growth in intervals with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth in recent years growth in the market for exchanges has slowed and we expect this trend may continue during 2020

benefit delivery and administration ‘bda’ 

the bda segment provides primary medical and ancillary benefit exchange and outsourcing services to active employees and retirees across both the group and individual markets a significant portion of the revenue in this segment is recurring in nature driven by either the commissions from the policies we sell or from longterm service contracts with our clients that typically range from three to five years revenue across this segment may be seasonal driven by the magnitude and timing of client enrollment activities which often occur during the fourth quarter with increased membership levels typically effective january 1 after calendar yearend benefits elections bda includes the operations of tranzact which experiences seasonally higher revenue during the fourth quarter due 

 

primarily to the timing of the federal medicare open enrollment window following the acquisition on july 30 2019 tranzact generated revenue of  245 million which is included in the bda segment revenue from its date of acquisition through the year ended dec ember 3 1  2019

bda segment revenue for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 10 billion and 758 million respectively bda’s organic growth was primarily led by the continued expansion of its client base and increased demand for project work in the midmarket and largemarket spaces 

costs of providing services

total costs of providing services was approximately 77 billion for both the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 representing a current year increase of 6 million see the following discussion for further details

salaries and benefits

salaries and benefits for the year ended december 31 2019 were 52 billion compared to 51 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 an increase of 126 million this increase was primarily a result of higher base salary adjustments severance costs and incentive accruals

other operating expenses

other operating expenses include occupancy legal marketing licenses royalties supplies technology printing and telephone costs as well as insurance including premiums on excess insurance and losses on professional liability claims travel by colleagues publications professional subscriptions and development recruitment other professional fees and irrecoverable value added and sales taxes

other operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 were 17 billion compared to 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 an increase of 82 million or 5 this increase was primarily due to the addition of tranzact expenses and higher professional services expenses partially offset by lower insurance and occupancy costs 

 

depreciation 

depreciation represents the expense incurred over the useful lives of our tangible fixed assets and internallydeveloped software depreciation for the year ended december 31 2019 was 240 million compared to 208 million for the year ended december 31 2018 an increase of 32 million or 15 the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to a higher depreciable base of assets resulting from additional assets placed in service during 2018 

amortization

amortization includes amortization of acquired intangible assets including acquired internally developed software amortization for the year ended december 31 2019 was 489 million compared to 534 million for the year ended december 31 2018 a decrease of 45 million or 8 our intangible amortization is more heavily weighted to the initial years of the useful lives of the related intangibles and therefore amortization related to intangible assets purchased prior to our acquisition of tranzact will continue to decrease over time our amortization will increase going forward as a result of the tranzact acquisition 

transaction and integration expenses

transaction and integration expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 was composed of 13 million of transaction costs primarily related to the acquisition of tranzact compared to 202 million of integration costs for the year ended december 31 2018 there were no integration costs incurred during 2019 due to the completion of all integration activities in 2018 

income from operations

income from operations for the year ended december 31 2019 was 13 billion compared to 809 million for the year ended december 31 2018 an increase of 520 million this increase resulted from higher revenue of 526 million which includes 245 million of tranzact revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses of 6 million primarily driven by higher salary and benefits costs and the addition of tranzact operating expenses during the current year the increase in the current year’s operating expenses was partially offset by the absence of integration expenses of 202 million incurred in the prior year 

interest expense

interest expense for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 234 million and 208 million respectively interest expense is primarily related to interest on our senior notes and term loan interest expense increased by 26 million for the year ended december 31 2019 which was due primarily to additional levels of indebtedness in connection with the tranzact acquisition and higher interest expense associated with our senior notes offerings during the third quarter of 2019 

other income net

other income net for the year ended december 31 2019 was 227 million compared to 250 million for the year ended december 31 2018 a decrease of 23 million the decrease in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily related to decreased pension income of 46 million for the full year 2019 in comparison with the prior year partially offset by favorable investment income activity of 16 million for the current year and a lower loss on disposal activity of 7 million 

provision for income taxes

provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2019 was 249 million compared with 136 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 were 188 and 160 respectively the tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 was lower primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance on certain state deferred tax assets in connection with a us internal restructuring and the global mix of income these effective tax rates are calculated using extended values from our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are therefore more precise tax rates than can be calculated from rounded values 

net income attributable to willis towers watson

net income attributable to willis towers watson for the year ended december 31 2019 was 10 billion compared to 695 million for the year ended december 31 2018 an increase of 349 million or 50 this increase was primarily due to organic revenue growth across all segments and the addition of tranzact’s operating results partially offset by increased salary and benefits costs and higher tax expense 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources

executive summary

our principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities or new debt offerings

based on our current balance sheet and cash flows current market conditions and information available to us at this time we believe that willis towers watson has access to sufficient liquidity which includes our undrawn revolving credit facilities to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months including investing in the business for growth scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments additionally we used term loan financing to complete our acquisition of tranzact see item 8 note 11 — debt within this filing on form 10k for further information regarding the term loan 

the company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when it expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments 

at december 31 2018 as a result of an international restructuring we were considering repatriating an additional 21 billion which was previously deemed indefinitely reinvested as a result we recorded an estimate for foreign withholding and state income tax expense of approximately 11 million at december 31 2018 during the second quarter of 2019 we repatriated a portion of this as previouslytaxed income and return of capital subsequent to the repatriation us treasury regulations were issued that would impact the us taxability of the balance of the earnings associated with the international restructuring as such the company changed its assertion with respect to any additional earnings from this restructuring for the foreseeable future and released approximately 8 million previously accrued for foreign withholding and state income tax expense of the original 21 billion under consideration 14 billion remains permanently reinvested at december 31 2019 

we continue to have certain subsidiaries whose earnings have not been deemed permanently reinvested for which we have been accruing estimates of the tax effects of such repatriation excluding these certain subsidiaries we continue to assert that the historical cumulative earnings for the remainder of our subsidiaries have been reinvested indefinitely and therefore do not provide deferred taxes on these amounts if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital longterm investment requirements or additional guidance relating to us tax reform necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for income and foreign withholding taxes net of credits may be necessary other potential sources of cash may be through the settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a taxefficient manner

events that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results potential future acquisitions or divestitures material changes in geographic sources of cash unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets

during the year ended december 31 2019 we completed an offering of 450 million aggregate principal amount of 2950 senior notes due 2029 and 550 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 senior notes due 2049 net proceeds of approximately 988 million were used to prepay a portion of the amount outstanding under our oneyear term loan commitment and to repay borrowings under our 125 billion revolving credit facility

assets and liabilities associated with nonus entities have been translated into us dollars as of december 31 2019 at us dollar rates that fluctuate compared to historical periods as a result cash flows derived from changes in the consolidated balance sheets include the impact of the change in foreign exchange translation rates

cash and cash equivalents

our cash and cash equivalents at both december 31 2019 and 2018 totaled 887 million and 10 billion respectively 

additionally at december 31 2019 12 billion was available to draw against our 125 billion revolving credit facility as compared to 11 billion which was available to draw against the facility at december 31 2018

we evaluate our revenue on an as reported us gaap constant currency and organic basis we believe presenting constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally





the constant currency and organic change results and a reconciliation from the reported results for consolidated revenue are included in the ‘consolidated revenue’ section within this form 10k these measures are also reported by segment in the ‘segment revenue’ section within this form 10k

a reconciliation of the reported change to the constant currency and organic change for the year ended december 31 2019 from the year ended december 31 2018 is as follows

 



 



adjusting for the impacts of foreign currency and acquisitions and disposals in the calculation of our organic activity our revenue grew by 5 for the year ended december 31 2019 this organic increase in revenue was driven by strong performances in all segments

adjusted operating incomemargin

we consider adjusted operating incomemargin to be important financial measures which are used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors

adjusted operating income is defined as income from operations adjusted for amortization transaction and integration expenses and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results adjusted operating income margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by revenue 

 

r econciliation s of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are as follows 

 



 

adjusted operating income increased for the year ended december 31 2019 to 18 billion from 15 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to organic revenue growth across all segments additionally on a yeartodate basis salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from 60 to 58

adjusted ebitdamargin

we consider adjusted ebitdamargin to be important financial measures which are used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations to benchmark our operating results against our competitors and to evaluate and measure our performancebased compensation plans

adjusted ebitda is defined as net income adjusted for provision for income taxes interest expense depreciation and amortization transaction and integration expenses gainloss on disposal of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results adjusted ebitda margin is calculated by dividing adjusted ebitda by revenue

reconciliations of net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are as follows

 



 

adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2019 was 23 billion compared to 20 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 this increase was primarily due to organic revenue growth across all segments and the addition of tranzact’s operating results partially offset by higher base salary adjustments severance costs and incentive accruals and decreased pension income

adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share

adjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to willis towers watson adjusted for amortization transaction and integration expenses gainloss on disposal of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results the related tax effect of those adjustments and the tax effects of internal reorganizations this measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share

 

adjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock diluted adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors 

reconciliations of net income attributable to willis towers watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are as follows

 



 





our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to organic revenue growth across all segments and the addition of tranzact’s operating results partially offset by higher base salary adjustments severance costs and incentive accruals and decreased pension income

adjusted income before taxes and adjusted income taxestax rate

adjusted income before taxes is defined as income from operations before income taxes adjusted for amortization transaction and integration expenses gainloss on disposal of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate

adjusted income taxestax rate is defined as the provision for income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization transaction and integration expenses gainloss on disposal of operations the tax effects of internal reorganizations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results divided by adjusted income before taxes adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate

management believes that the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate that we would incur if not for the reduction of pretax income for the adjusted items and the tax effects of our internal reorganizations which are not core to our current and future operations

 

reconciliations of income from operations before income taxes to adjusted income before taxes and provision forbenefit from income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are as follows 

 



 



our us gaap tax rates were 188 and 160 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively our adjusted income tax rates were 203 and 195 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the us gaap tax rate and the adjusted income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 were lower primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance on certain state deferred tax assets in connection with a us internal restructuring and the global mix of income in 2018

free cash flow

free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use free cash flow is a liquidity measure and is not meant to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures

management believes that free cash flow presents the core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations

reconciliations of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are as follows

 



the decrease in free cash flows in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily resulted from unfavorable working capital changes particularly in accounts receivable and the negative cash flows of tranzact

critical accounting policies and estimates

these consolidated financial statements conform to us gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period our estimates judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates the areas that we believe include critical accounting policies are revenue recognition costs to fulfill broking contracts valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients discretionary 

 

compensation income taxes commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities pension assumptions and goodwill and intangible assets the critical accounting policies discussed below involve making difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations these critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption different estimates that we could have used or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

revenue recognition effective january 1 2018

we use significant estimates related to revenue recognition most commonly during our estimation of the transaction prices or where we recognize revenue over time on a proportional performance basis a brief description of these policies and estimates is included below

estimation of transaction prices — this process occurs most frequently in certain broking transactions in situations in which our fees are not fixed but are variable we must estimate the likely commission per policy taking into account the likelihood of cancellation before the end of the policy for medicare broking affinity arrangements and proportional treaty reinsurance broking the commissions to which we will be entitled can vary based on the underlying individual insurance policies that are placed for medicare broking and proportional treaty reinsurance in particular we base the estimates of transaction prices on supportable evidence from an analysis of past transactions and only include amounts that are probable of being received or not refunded referred to as applying ‘constraint’ under asc 606 in our directtoconsumer medicare broking arrangements the estimate of the total renewal commissions that will be received over the lifetime of the policy requires significant judgment and will vary based on product type estimated commission rates the expected lives of the respective policies and other factors the company has applied an actuarial model to account for these uncertainties which is updated periodically based on actual experience each of these processes result in us estimating a transaction price that may be significantly lower than the ultimate amount of commissions we may collect the transaction price is then adjusted over time as we receive confirmation of our remuneration through receipt of commissions or as other information becomes available 

proportional performance basis over time recognition — where we recognize revenue on a proportional performance basis primarily in our consulting and outsourced administration arrangements the amount we recognize is affected by a number of factors that can change the estimated amount of work required to complete the project such as the staffing on the engagement andor the level of client participation our periodic engagement evaluations require us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stages of project completion that in turn affect how we recognize revenue we recognize a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than the total estimated costs associated with the engagement losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 

costs to fulfill broking contracts effective january 1 2018

for our broking business the company must estimate the fulfillment costs incurred during the preplacement of the broking contracts these judgments include









valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from a client’s failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered which are recorded in other operating expenses we also maintain allowances related to our unbilled receivables for such items as expected realization or client disputes the related provision for which is recorded as a reduction to revenue our allowance policy is based on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on our writeoff history facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due general market conditions current economic trends and our clients’ ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables

discretionary compensation

our compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year after our annual operating results are finalized

 

an estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted if necessary by management to reflect changes in the forecast of prebonus profitability for the year 

income taxes

the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the change is enacted deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as based on available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company adjusts valuation allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amounts considered realizable in future periods when the company’s facts and assumptions change in making such determinations the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operating results we place more reliance on evidence that is objectively verifiable

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities

we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance and the provision of consulting services in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice in certain cases where a range of loss exists we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount

see note 15 — commitments and contingencies in item 8 within this annual report on form 10k

pension assumptions

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in several countries with the most significant defined benefit plans offered in the us and uk our disclosures in note 13 — retirement benefits contain additional information about our other less significant but material retirement plans within our critical accounting policy discussion we have excluded analysis for plans outside of those noted in the description below as any variance of recorded information based on management’s estimates would be immaterial

descriptions of our us and uk plans which comprise 90 of our projected benefit obligations and 93 of our plan assets are below

united states

legacy willis – this plan was frozen in 2009 approximately onequarter of the legacy willis employees in the united states have a frozen accrued benefit under this plan

willis towers watson plan – substantially all us employees are eligible to participate in this plan benefits are provided under a stable value pension plan design the original stable value design came into effect on january 1 2012 existing plan participants prior to july 1 2017 earn benefits without having to make employee contributions and all newly eligible employees after that date are required to contribute 2 of pay on an aftertax basis to participate in the plan

united kingdom

legacy willis – this plan covers approximately onethird of the legacy willis employees in the united kingdom the plan is now closed to new entrants new employees in the united kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan

legacy towers watson – benefit accruals earned under the legacy watson wyatt defined benefit plan predominantly pension benefits ceased on february 28 2015 although benefits earned prior to january 1 2008 retain a link to salary until the employee leaves the company benefit accruals earned under the legacy towers perrin defined benefit plan predominantly lump sum benefits were frozen on march 31 2008 all participants now accrue defined contribution benefits

 

legacy miller – the plan provides retirement benefits based on members’ salaries at the point at which they ceased to accrue benefits under the scheme 

the determination of the company’s obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that given the longevity of the plans are longterm in focus a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation however certain of these changes such as changes in the discount rates and other actuarial assumptions are not recognized immediately in net income but are instead recorded in other comprehensive income the accumulated gains and losses not yet recognized in net income are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit costincome over the average remaining service period or average remaining life expectancy as appropriate of the plan’s participants to the extent that the net gains or losses as of the beginning of the year exceed 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation

willis towers watson considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions including economic forecasts relevant benchmarks historical trends portfolio composition and peer company comparisons these assumptions used to determine our pension liabilities and pension expense are reviewed annually by senior management and changed when appropriate a discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas an expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longerterm trends in asset returns emerge or longterm target asset allocations are revised to calculate the discount rate we use the granular approach to determining service cost and interest cost the expected rate of return assumptions for all plans are supported by an analysis of the weightedaverage yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality and the expected longterm rates of compensation and pension increases

funding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes or as agreed to with the plan trustees for the uk plans since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes pension contributions are not equal to net periodic benefit cost

we recorded a combined 147 million net periodic benefit income for our us and uk plans for the year ended december 31 2019 for the us and uk plans the following table presents our estimated net periodic benefit income for 2020 and the impact to both plans of a 025 increase and decrease to both the expected return on assets ‘eroa’ and the discount rate assumptions and the projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2019 and the impact of a 025 increase and decrease to the discount rates

 



 

economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear

goodwill and intangible assets — impairment review

in applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with the remainder recorded as goodwill intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise the fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise

goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and the company had nine reporting units as of october 1 2019

during fiscal year 2019 the company performed step 1 of the twostep impairment test for all reporting units each of the reporting units estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values to perform the test we used valuation techniques to estimate the 

 

fair value of a reporting unit that are under the income and or market approaches of valuation methods  under the discounted cash flow method an income approach the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debtfree aftertax cash flows for a finite period of years key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management assessment of business risk and expected rates of return on capital the guideline company method a market approach develops valuation multiples by comparing our repo rting units to similar publicly traded companies key estimates and determination of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies obtaining forecast revenue and ebitda estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics under the similar transactions method a market approach actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably s imilar to the reporting units are used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units 

if the company was required to perform step 2 for any of the reporting units used in step 1 we would determine the implied fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination then the implied fair value of goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine if goodwill is impaired for the year ended december 31 2019 we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill or intangibles

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

financial risk management

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 — basis of presentation significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements and note 10 — derivative financial instruments within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

foreign exchange risk

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the us we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earn revenue in several currencies but incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenue and expenses by currency in 2019

 



 

 

 



our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from







london market operations

the company’s primary foreign exchange risks in its london market operations arise from changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and pound sterling as its london market operations earn the majority of its revenue in us dollars but incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling and may also hold significant foreign currency asset or liability positions on its consolidated balance sheet in addition the london market operations earn significant revenue in euro and japanese yen

the foreign exchange risks in our london market operations are hedged to the extent that







intercompany lending between subsidiaries

the company engages in intercompany borrowing and lending between subsidiaries primarily through our inhouse banking operations which give rise to foreign exchange exposures the company mitigates these risks through the use of shortterm foreign 

 

currency forward and swap transactions that offset the underlying exposure created when the borrower and lender have different functional currencies these derivatives are not generally designated as hedging instruments and at december 31 2019 we had notional amounts of 931 million denominated primarily in us dollars pound sterling euro and australian dollars and had net fair value assets of 21 million maturities are typically within three months 

translation risk

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenue and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weightedaverage contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within two years

 



 

 



income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the uk is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency however the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities

interest rate risk

the company has access to 125 billion under a revolving credit facility expiring march 7 2022 as of december 31 2019 no amount was drawn on this facility we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in us dollars pounds sterling and euros

 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the company’s previously held interest rate swap derivatives matured during 2018 and it has not entered into additional interest rate hedging contracts during 201 9  

 



 

 







interest income on fiduciary funds

as a result of our operating activities we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies we earn interest on these funds which is included in our consolidated financial statements as interest income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity at december 31 2019 we held 20 billion of fiduciary funds invested in interestbearing accounts if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 25 basis points interest earned on these invested fiduciary funds and therefore our interest income recognized would increase or decrease by approximately 5 million on an annualized basis

liborrelated debt instruments 

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee ‘arrc’ a group of privatemarket participants convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york to help ensure a successful transition from us dollar libor ‘usdlibor’ to a more robust reference rate has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate ‘sofr’ represents the best alternative to usdlibor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to usdlibor arrc has proposed a transition plan with specific steps and timelines designed to encourage the adoption of sofr and guide the transition to sofr from usdlibor organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to usdlibor similar efforts are underway to identify suitable replacement reference rates for libor in other major currencies 

as of december 31 2019 the company’s primary exposure is its 125 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2022 and its collateralized facility assumed as part of its acquisition of tranzact which are both priced using rates tied to libor we anticipate renegotiating the revolving credit facility prior to the potential libor quotation termination date and will renegotiate or repay the collateralized facility prior to the end of 2021 in addition the company and its subsidiaries have entered into various intercompany notes indexed to libor the company expects to amend or replace the liborbased intercompany notes as necessary to reflect new market benchmarks for the relevant loan currencies prior to the 2021 deadline 

we are currently evaluating the liborrelated risks that may be inherent elsewhere in our business and are monitoring for further proposals and guidance from the arrc and other alternativerate initiatives with the expectation that we will be prepared for the termination and replacement of the libor benchmarks

credit risk and concentrations of credit risk

credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted the company currently does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties the company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk

concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the company to concentrations of 

 

credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents fiduciary funds accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value 

the company maintains a policy of providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure these financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies

concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the company does business as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas management does not believe that significant risk exists in connection with the company’s concentrations of credit as of december 31 2019

changes in internal control over financial reporting

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in the quarter ended december 31 2019 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our ceo and cfo and overseen by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that

 







internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company management has used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ‘coso’ in the report entitled internal control — integrated framework 2013 to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on this evaluation management has concluded that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019

our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal control over financial reporting at tranzact sec guidance permits management to omit an assessment of an acquired business’ internal control over financial reporting from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition we are in the process of integrating tranzact operations within our internal control structure accordingly management has excluded controls relating to tranzact in this quarter’s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

 

tranzact was acquired on july 30  2019 and is included in our 2019 consolidated financial statements and represented approximately 5 of our total assets as of december 31 20 19 and 3 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 

the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein

competition

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with accenture plc aon plc arthur j gallagher  co brown  brown inc cognizant technology solutions corporation marsh  mclennan companies inc and robert half international inc as well as with numerous specialty regional and local firms marsh  mclennan companies and aon plc are two of the largest providers of global risk management services competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and in some business lines marsh  mclennan companies and aon plc have greater market share than we do

competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services

the human capital and risk management consulting industries are highly competitive we believe there are significant barriers to entry and we have developed competitive advantages in providing hr consulting and risk management consulting services we face strong competition from several sources

our principal competitors in the pension consulting industry are mercer hr consulting a marsh  mclennan company and aon plc beyond these large players the global hr consulting industry is highly fragmented

our major competitors in the insurance consulting and software industry include milliman oliver wyman a marsh  mclennan company the big four accounting firms and sungard aon buck consultants a conduent company connextions a united healthcare company mercer a marsh  mclennan company automatic data processing and fidelity are our primary competitors in the insurance exchange industry with the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act we also compete with the public exchanges currently run by the us federal and state governments 

 

we now compete with providers of accountbased health plans and consumerdirected benefits such as wageworks and healthequity 

the market for our services is subject to change as a result of economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors regulatory and legislative actions along with continuously evolving technological developments will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products we believe the primary factors in selecting an hr consulting or risk management services firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs with regard to the marketplace for individuals and active employee exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings a strong reputation for efficient execution a provider’s capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments and financing options and an innovative service delivery model and platform for our traditional consulting and risk management services and the rapidly evolving exchange products we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors

 item 1a risk factors

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements these risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business the descriptions below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown to us could also impair our business operations financial condition or results if any of the risks and uncertainties below or other risks were to occur our business operations financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted with respect to the taxrelated consequences of acquisition ownership and disposal of ordinary shares you should consult with your own tax advisors 

strategic and operational risks 

our success largely depends on our ability to achieve our global business strategy as it evolves and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer if the company were unable to successfully establish and execute on its strategy and generate anticipated revenue growth and cost savings and efficiencies

our future growth profitability and cash flows largely depend upon our ability to successfully establish and execute our global business strategy as discussed under item 1 ‘business  business strategy’ we seek to be an advisory broking and solutions provider of choice through an integrated global platform while we have confidence that our strategic plan reflects opportunities that are appropriate and achievable there is a possibility that our strategy may not deliver projected longterm growth in revenue and profitability due to inadequate execution incorrect assumptions global or local economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we operate suboptimal resource allocation or any of the other risks described in this ‘risk factors’ section in addition our strategy has evolved since the merger and continues to evolve and it is possible that we will be unable to successfully execute the associated strategy changes including due to factors discussed above or elsewhere in this ‘risk factors’ section in pursuit of our growth strategy we may also invest significant time and resources into new product or service offerings and there is the possibility that these offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment the failure to continually develop and execute optimally on our global business strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

demand for our services could decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn increased competition or a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or prospects all of which could materially adversely affect us 

we can give no assurance that the demand for our services will grow or be maintained or that we will compete successfully with our existing competitors new competitors or our clients’ internal capabilities client demand for our services may change based on the clients’ needs and financial conditions among other factors

our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve for example any changes in us trade policy including any increases in tariffs that result in a trade war ongoing stock market volatility or an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the general economy as a result global financial markets may continue to experience disruptions including increased volatility and reduced credit availability which could substantially impact our results while it is difficult to predict the consequences of any deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing our services or insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the potential for a significant insurer to fail be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenue and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients

in addition the markets for our principal services are highly competitive our competitors include other insurance brokerage human capital and risk management consulting and actuarial firms and the human capital and risk management divisions of diversified professional services insurance brokerage and accounting firms and specialty regional and local firms

competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and some competitors have greater market share in certain lines of business than we do some of our competitors have greater financial technical and marketing resources than us which could enhance their ability to finance acquisitions fund internal growth and respond more quickly to professional and technological changes new competitors as well as increasing and evolving consolidation or alliances among existing competitors could create additional competition and significantly reduce our market share resulting in a loss of business for us and a corresponding decline in revenue and profit margin in order to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure we may have to lower our prices which would also have an adverse effect on our revenue and profit margin

in addition existing and new competitors could develop competing technologies or product or service offerings that disrupt our industries any new technology or product or service offering including insurance companies selling their products directly to consumers or other insureds that reduces or eliminates the need for intermediaries in insurance or reinsurance sales transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further the increasing willingness of clients to either selfinsure or maintain a captive insurance company and the development of capital marketsbased solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs could also materially adversely affect us and our results of operations

an example of a business that may be significantly impacted by changes in customer demand is our retirement consulting and actuarial business which comprises a substantial portion of our revenue and profit we provide clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans defined benefit pension plans generally require more actuarial services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools complex calculations to determine employer costs funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate or if we are unable to otherwise compensate for the decline in our business that results from employers moving away from defined benefit plans our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

in addition the demand for many of our core benefit services including compliancerelated services is affected by government regulation and taxation of employee benefit plans significant changes in tax or social welfare policy or other regulations could lead some employers to discontinue their employee benefit plans including defined benefit pension plans thereby reducing the demand for our services a simplification of regulations or tax policy also could reduce the need for our services

 

we could be subject to claims and lawsuits arising from our work which could materially adversely affect our reputation business and financial condition 

we depend in large part on our relationships with clients and our reputation for highquality services to secure future engagements clients that become dissatisfied with our services may terminate their business relationships with us and clients and third parties that claim they suffered damages caused by our services may bring lawsuits against us we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the provision of our services or the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims see note 14  commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k for examples of claims to which we are subject

because we often assist our clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money including actuarial services asset management and the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may arise that allege our potential liability for all or part of the substantial amounts in question the nature of our work particularly our actuarial services necessarily involves the use of assumptions and the preparation of estimates relating to future and contingent events the actual outcome of which we cannot know in advance our actuarial and brokerage services also rely on substantial amounts of data provided by clients the accuracy and quality of which we cannot ensure in addition we could make computational software programming or data management errors in connection with the services we provide to clients

clients may seek to hold us responsible for alleged errors or omissions relating to any of the brokerage advice and services we provide including when claims they submit to their insurance carriers are disputed or denied given that many of our clients have very high insurance policy limits to cover their risks alleged errors and omissions claims against us arising from disputed or denied claims are often significant moreover in various circumstances our brokerage investment and certain other types of business may not limit the maximum liability to which we may be exposed for claims involving alleged errors or omissions and as such we do not have limited liability for the work we provide to the associated clients

further given that we frequently work with large pension funds and insurance companies as well as other large clients relatively small percentage errors or variances can create significant financial variances and result in significant claims for unintended or unfunded liabilities the risks from such variances or errors could be aggravated in an environment of declining pension fund asset values and insurance company capital levels in almost all cases our exposure to liability with respect to a particular engagement is substantially greater than the revenue opportunity that the engagement generates for us

clients may seek to hold us responsible for the financial consequences of variances between assumptions and estimates and actual outcomes or for errors for example in the case of pension plan actuarial work a client’s claims might focus on the client’s alleged reliance on actuarial assumptions that it believes were unreasonable and based on such reliance the client made benefit commitments that it may later claim are not affordable or funding decisions that result in plan underfunding if and when actual outcomes vary from actuarial assumptions

we also continue to create new products and services and to grow the business of providing products and services to institutional investors financial services companies and other clients the risk of claims from these lines of business and related products and services may be greater than from our core products or services and such claims may be for significant amounts

we also provide advice on both asset allocation and selection of investment managers increasingly for many clients we are responsible for making decisions on both of these matters or we may serve in a fiduciary capacity either of which may increase liability exposure in addition the company offers affiliated investment funds including in the us and ireland with plans to launch additional funds over time given that our investment business may recommend affiliated investment funds or affirmatively invest such clients’ assets in such funds under delegated authority this may increase our liability exposure we may also be liable for actions of managers or other service providers to the funds further for certain clients we are responsible for some portions of cash and investment management including rebalancing of investment portfolios and guidance to third parties on the structure of derivatives and securities transactions asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and investment managers may underperform their benchmarks in both cases the investment return shortfall can be significant clients experiencing this underperformance including from our affiliated investment funds may assert claims against us and such claims may be for significant amounts in addition our failure to properly execute our role can cause monetary damage to our clients or such third parties for which we might be found liable and such claims may be for significant amounts our expected expansion of this business geographically and in new offerings will subject us to additional contractual exposures and obligations with investors asset managers and third party service providers as well as 

 

increased regulatory exposures overall our ability to contractually limit our potential liability may be limited in certain jurisdictions or markets or in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary duties or other alleged errors or omissions 

the ultimate outcome of all of the above matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us in addition our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against such liabilities it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the industries we operate in or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships in addition defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs

as a highlyregulated company we are subject from time to time to inquiries or investigations by governmental agencies or regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations

we have also been and may continue to be subject to inquiries and investigations by federal state or other governmental agencies regarding aspects of our clients’ businesses or our own businesses especially regulated businesses such as our insurance broker securities brokerdealer and investment advisory services such inquiries or investigations may consume significant management time and result in regulatory sanctions fines or other actions as well as significant legal fees which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and liquidity also we may face additional regulatory scrutiny as we expand our businesses geographically and in new products and services that we offer

examples of these inquiries or investigations are set forth in more detail in note 14 — commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k these include the european commission’s civil investigation proceedings in respect of an alleged exchange of commercially sensitive information among competitors in aerospace insurance and reinsurance broking in the european economic area as well as investigation proceedings brought by other regulators

all of these items reflect an increased focus by regulators in the uk us and elsewhere on various aspects of the operations and affairs of our regulated businesses we are unable to predict the outcome of these inquiries or investigations any proposed changes that result from these investigations and inquiries or any other investigations inquiries or regulatory developments or any potential fines or enforcement action could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions and we face risks when we acquire or divest businesses and could have difficulty in acquiring integrating or managing acquired businesses or with effecting internal reorganizations all of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation

our growth depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions as we complete the merger integration period we may consider larger acquisition opportunities than we have pursued over the past few years we may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms acceptable or favorable to us we also face additional risks related to acquisitions including that we could overpay for acquired businesses and that any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to our expectations in addition we may not repurchase as many of our outstanding shares as anticipated due to our acquisition activity or investment opportunities as well as other market or business conditions if we are unable to identify and successfully make integrate and manage acquisitions our business could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks related to divesting businesses including that we may not receive adequate consideration in return for the divested business we may continue to be subject to the liabilities of the divested business after its divestiture including with respect to work we might have performed on behalf of the divested business and we may not be able to reduce overhead or redeploy assets or retain colleagues after the divestiture closes

in addition we cannot be certain that our acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or that our acquisitions or divestitures will otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if the operating performance of an acquired business deteriorates significantly we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet

we may be unable to effectively integrate an acquired business into our organization and may not succeed in managing such acquired businesses or the larger company that results from such acquisitions the process of integrating an acquired business 

 

may subject us to a number of risks including without limitation an inability to retain the management key personnel and other employees of the acquired business an inability to establish uniform standards controls systems procedures and policies or to achieve anticipated savings and exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition 

if acquisitions are not successfully integrated our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as well as our professional reputation we also own an interest in a number of associates and companies where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore limited in our ability to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we could achieve if we had full ownership 

data security breaches or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could result in material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

we depend on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners insurance carriersmarkets and clients additionally one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their customers andor employees our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks computer viruses hackers distributed denial of service attacks malware infections ransomware attacks phishing and spearphishing campaigns and other external hazards as well as improper or inadvertent staff behavior could expose confidential company and personal data systems and information to security breaches

many of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from and supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors our thirdparty applications include enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services provided and maintained by thirdparty vendors these thirdparty applications store confidential and proprietary data of both the company and our clients we have processes designed to require thirdparty it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyberattack on a vendor’s information systems further the potential impact of a data breach of our thirdparty vendors’ systems increases as we move more of our and our clients’ data into our vendors’ cloud storage we engage in it outsourcing or we consolidate the group of thirdparty vendors that provide cloud storage or other it services for the company

we and our vendors regularly experience cybersecurity incidents including successful attacks from time to time and we expect that to continue going forward however to our knowledge we have not experienced any attacks or other cybersecurity incidents that have been material to our business or financial results some of these incidents include those resulting from human error or malfeasance implantation of malware and viruses phishing and spearphishing attacks unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems and unauthorized access to data or individual account funds through fraud or other means of deceiving our colleagues thirdparty service providers and vendors we have experienced successful attacks by various types of hacking groups in which personal and commercially sensitive information belonging to us or our clients has been compromised however none of these attacks to our knowledge have been material when required by law we have notified individuals and relevant regulatory authorities such as state attorney generals state insurance regulators the us department of health and human services and the uk’s information commissioner’s office of such incidents

over time the frequency severity and sophistication of the attacks against us have increased we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards such as where in place multifactor authentication and encryption of data in transit and at rest designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however such safeguards are time consuming and expensive to deploy broadly and are not necessarily always in place or effective and we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of data security breaches improper access to takeover of or disclosure of confidential company or personally identifiable information we may not be able to detect and assess such issues or implement appropriate remediation in a timely manner our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we hold and protect it from theft computer viruses hackers or inadvertent loss

if any person including any of our colleagues fails to comply with disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines regulatory enforcement or criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client supplier or employee data whether through systems failure accident employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or 

 

those we develop for our clients whether by our colleagues or third parties could result in significant additional expenses including expenses relating to incident response and investigation remediation work notification of data security breaches and costs of credit monitoring services negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation as well as require substantial resources and effort of management thereby diverting management’s focus and resources from business operations 

the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving continue to become more sophisticated and complex and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for example the cyber division of the us federal bureau of investigation ‘fbi’ has noted that cyber criminals have targeted and may increasingly target assets held in health savings accounts and reimbursement accounts to fraudulently acquire the assets held in those accounts assets held in health savings accounts are expected to grow substantially over the next few years we have experienced incidents in which unauthorized actors compromised personal information including through use of unlawfully obtained demographic information these incidents have not had a material impact on our business or operations but given the company’s move toward managing more of these assets ourselves as a nonbank custodian our reputation could be harmed and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are the target of such fraud in the future

we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against fraud or unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss the everevolving threats mean that we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate adapt enhance and otherwise improve our respective systems and processes especially as we grow our mobile cloud and other internetbased services there is no guarantee that such efforts will be adequate to safeguard against all fraud data security breaches operational impacts or misuses of data for example our policies employee training including phishing prevention training procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential personal or proprietary information by employees vendors or other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems any future significant compromise or breach of our data security or fraud whether external or internal or misuse of client colleague supplier or company data could result in additional significant costs lost revenue opportunities fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation with our clients and in the broader market 

our inability to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations related to data privacy and cyber security could result in material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect client colleague supplier and company data such as the eu general data protection regulation ‘gdpr’ regulations from other countries that prohibit the transmission of data outside of such country’s borders and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health financial or other individually identifiable information gdpr which became effective in may 2018 significantly increases our responsibilities when handling personal data including without limitation requiring us to conduct privacy impact assessments restricting the transmission of data and requiring public disclosure of significant data breaches violations of gdpr may result in possible fines of up to 4 of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million whichever is higher laws and regulations in this area are evolving and generally becoming more stringent for example the new york state department of financial services has issued cybersecurity regulations that outline a variety of required security measures for protection of data other us states including california and south carolina have also recently enacted cybersecurity laws requiring certain security measures of regulated entities that are broadly similar to gdpr requirements and we expect that other states will continue to do so further a uk exit from the eu will increase uncertainty regarding applicable laws and regulations pending more clarity on the terms of that exit 

all of these evolving laws and regulations some of which may be subject to evolving interpretations or conflicts with one another may restrict the manner in which we provide services to our clients divert resources from other important initiatives increase the risk of noncompliance and impose significant compliance and other costs that are likely to increase over time and increase the risk of fines lawsuits or other potential liability all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to legal or regulatory requirements including changing legal or regulatory requirements that may be developed or revised due to brexit and changing customer expectations in this area could result in substantial legal liability and impairment to our reputation or business 

 

the decision by the united kingdom to leave the european union any changes to such decision and the risk that other countries may follow could adversely affect us 

in 2018 approximately 23 of our revenue was generated in the uk although only about 13 of revenue was denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 21 of our expenses were denominated in pounds sterling given the evolving status of brexit it remains difficult to predict with any level of certainty the impact that it will have on the economy economic regulatory and political stability and market conditions in europe including in the uk or on the pound sterling euro or other european currencies but any such impacts and others we cannot currently anticipate could materially adversely affect us and our operations among other things we could experience lower growth in the region due to indecision by businesses holding off on generating new projects or due to adverse market conditions and reduced reported revenue and earnings because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars due to the fact that we translate revenue denominated in nonus currencies such as pounds sterling into us dollars for our financial statements in addition there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective

the british government and the eu continue to negotiate the terms of the uks future relationship with the eu while many separation issues have been resolved significant uncertainty remains it is also possible that brexit does not occur as planned on march 29 2019 that the uk decides not to exit the eu at all or that the uk exists the eu in a potentially disruptive manner with no agreed future relationship the company is heavily invested in the uk in our businesses and activities if brexit negatively impacts the uk then it could have a material adverse impact on us in addition brexit may result in greater restrictions on business between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities there is also uncertainty as to how the uks access to the eu single market and the wider trading legal regulatory tax social and labor environments especially in the uk and eu will be impacted including the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients any such changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results for example any changes to the passporting or other regulations relating to doing business in various eu countries by relying on a regulatory permission in the uk or doing business in the uk by relying on a regulatory permission in an eu country could increase our costs of doing business or our ability to do so at this point we do not expect the current passporting regime to continue any such change or other change in regulations could increase our costs of doing business or in some cases affect our ability to do business and adversely impact our operations and financial results 

in addition the risk of a ‘hardbrexit’ remains that is that the uk will leave the eu without formal terms for its withdrawal as well as their future relationship we have planned for a worstcase hardbrexit and remain in the process of establishing appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business under that scenario these arrangements include the transaction of certain businesses andor the movement of certain businesses outside of the uk however various significant risks remain in the context of a hardbrexit those risks include the following among others















 

there is also a risk that other countries may decide to leave the eu we cannot predict the impact that any additional countries leaving the eu will have on us but any such impacts could materially adversely affect us 

allegations of conflicts of interest including in connection with accepting market derived income ‘mdi’ may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or reputation

we could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest conflicts of interest exist or could exist any time the company or any of its employees has or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests this could occur for example when the company is providing services to multiple parties in connection with a transaction in addition as we provide more solutionsbased services there is greater potential for conflicts with advisory services managing conflicts of interest is an important issue for the company but can be a challenge for a large and complex company such as ours due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base we regularly address potential conflicts of interest including without limitation situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client if these are not carefully managed this could then lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests with attendant regulatory and reputational risks that could materially adversely affect us and our operations there is no guarantee that all potential conflicts of interest will be identified and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our professional reputation and result in legal liability which may have a material adverse effect on our business identifying conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult in the nearterm while we continue to bring systems and information together and further integrate legacy willis legacy towers watson and gras savoye in addition we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest

in addition insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of placements we make for clients or by fees paid by clients intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers this revenue when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets as opposed to as corporate clients of the intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other nonmarket related services is commonly known as market derived income or ‘mdi’ mdi is another example of an area in which allegations of conflicts of interest may arise mdi takes a variety of forms including volume or profitbased contingent commissions facilities administration charges business development agreements and fees for providing certain data to carriers

mdi creates various risks intermediaries in many markets have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ or their own interests ahead of their clients accordingly mdi may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest antitrust unfair competition conduct and antibribery laws and regulations while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice and while we have established systems and controls to manage these risks we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be effective

in addition the company offers affiliated investment funds with plans to launch additional funds over time given that our investment business may recommend affiliated investment funds or affirmatively invest such clients’ assets in such funds under delegated authority there may be a perceived conflict of interest while the company has processes procedures and controls in place intended to mitigate potential conflicts such perception could cause regulatory inquiries or could impact client demand and the business’ financial performance and our controls may not be effective in addition underperformance by our affiliated investment funds could lead to lawsuits by clients that were invested in such funds

separately the fca wholesale market study is also examining various potential conflicts of interest in the wholesale insurance brokerage industry there can be no assurances as to the outcome of this market study and the fca may recommend or require significant changes in the industry further investigation or impose firmspecific remedies  

the failure or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions conflicts of interest may also arise in the future that could cause material harm to us

damage to our reputation including due to the failure of third parties on whom we rely to perform services or public opinions of third parties with whom we associate could adversely affect our businesses

maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with clients and colleagues damage to our reputation could therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory action failure to deliver 

 

minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures allegations of conflicts of interest and unethical behavior such harm could also arise from negative public opinions or political conditions arising from our association with third parties in any number of activities or circumstances negative perceptions or publicity whether or not true may result in harm to our prospects in addition the failure to deliver satisfactory service and quality in one line of business could cause clients to terminate the services we provide to that client in many other lines of business this risk has increased as the company has become larger and more complex 

in addition as part of providing services to clients and managing our business we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers our ability to perform effectively depends in part on the ability of these service providers to meet their obligations as well as on our effective oversight of their performance the quality of our services could suffer or we could be required to incur unanticipated costs if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as expected or their services are disrupted this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation as well as our business and results of operations 

the loss of key colleagues could damage or result in the loss of client relationships and could result in such colleagues competing against us

our success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including key managers and colleagues in addition our success largely depends upon our colleagues’ abilities to generate business and provide quality services in particular our colleagues’ business relationships with our clients are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements labor markets have continued to tighten globally and we have experienced intense competition for certain types of colleagues in the past as a result of the merger and otherwise we have lost colleagues who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise if we lose additional colleagues such as those it could result in such colleagues competing against us and could materially adversely affect our ability to secure and complete engagements which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational changes could impact our business results

we have in the past few years undergone several significant business and organizational changes including the merger the gras savoye acquisition and multiyear operational improvement programs among others there are also a number of other initiatives planned or ongoing to transform our processes and gain efficiencies in addition our strategy has evolved since the merger and continues to evolve and such evolution may result in further organizational changes in connection with all these changes we are managing a number of largescale and complex projects while we have concluded that each of these large complex projects is necessary or desirable to the execution of the company’s business strategy we cannot guarantee that the collective effect of all of these projects will not adversely impact our business or results of operations effectively managing these organizational changes is critical to retaining talent servicing clients and our business success overall the failure to effectively manage such risks could adversely impact our resources or business or financial results 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breach power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities access to data and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations

a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability particularly if any of these problems occur during peak times 

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing hardware or systems could cause material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems develop and create new systems and products in order to keep 

 

pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards and to be at the forefront of a range of technology relevant to our business 

in addition many of the software applications including enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services that we use in our business are licensed from and supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors we are increasing our use of such cloud services and expect this to increase over time these thirdparty applications store confidential and proprietary data of both the company and our clients a suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruptions that could adversely impact our business

if the data we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer hardware applications or software systems or the loss of skilled people with the knowledge needed to operate older systems or if we experience other disruptions this could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability 

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal regulatory cultural market operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal regulatory market operational and other risks our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets the possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses and financial results these risks include

















sanctions imposed by governments or changes to such sanction regulations could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial results

as described above our businesses are subject to the risk of sanctions imposed by the us the eu and other governments in recent months the scope of actual and potential sanctions that may impact our business has increased a significant example of this relates to russia and the recent designation by the us of a number of individuals and companies as sanctioned parties as well as other us sanctions on nicaragua and venezuela and a number of related individuals and companies there is potential for broader sanctions in the future from the us the eu the uk and others in addition proposed legislation in russia could allow countersanctions to be imposed that may impact our business it is not yet clear what form any countersanctions in russia might take and how they may impact our business further it is not yet clear whether market dynamics in russia may disadvantage local companies controlled by foreign holding companies as a result 

 

we cannot predict the impact of changes in us eu uk russian or other sanctions and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial results 

our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government laws or regulations or if government laws or regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs

a material portion of our revenue is affected by statutory or regulatory changes an example of a statutory or regulatory change that could materially impact us is any change to the us patient protection and affordable care act ‘ppaca’ and the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 ‘hcera’ which we refer to collectively as ‘healthcare reform’ while the us congress has not passed legislation replacing or significantly amending healthcare reform other than changes to the individual mandate such legislation or another version of healthcare reform could be implemented in the future in addition various aspects of healthcare reform have been challenged in the judicial system with some success the status of some of those challenges are in flux but could materially change us healthcare if we are unable to adapt our services to potential new laws and regulations or judicial modifications with respect to healthcare reform or otherwise our ability to provide effective services in these areas may be substantially impacted in addition more restrictive rules or interpretations of the centers for medicare and medicaid services marketing rules or judicial decisions that restrict or otherwise change existing provisions of us healthcare regulation could have a material adverse impact on our benefits delivery and administration business

many areas in which we provide services are the subject of government regulation which is constantly evolving for example our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services are subject to regulation and supervision by national state or other authorities insurance laws in the markets in which we operate are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the markets in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these locations

changes in government and accounting regulations in the us and the uk two of our principal geographic markets affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human capital programs may materially adversely affect the demand for or the profitability of various of our services in addition we have significant operations throughout the world which further subject us to applicable laws and regulations of countries outside the us and the uk changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators in particular countries including changes in administration and enforcement policies could require operational improvements or modifications which may result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business in those countries 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we comply with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the us the uk the eu and its member states and the other jurisdictions around the world in which we operate in addition we own an interest in a number of associates and companies where we do not exercise management control over the last few years regulators across the world are increasingly seeking to regulate brokers who operate in their jurisdictions the foreign and us laws and regulations applicable to our operations are complex continually evolving and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings these laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations antitrust and competition laws economic and trade sanctions laws relating to countries in which certain subsidiaries do business or may do business ‘sanctioned jurisdictions’ such as cuba iran russia sudan and syria anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act 2010 and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us as well as laws and regulations related to data privacy and cyber security because of changes in regulation and company practice our nonus subsidiaries are providing more services with connections to various countries including some sanctioned jurisdictions that our us subsidiaries are unable to perform

in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies monetary fines injunctions 

 

revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients while we believe that we have substantially increased our focus on the geographic breadth of regulations to which we are subject maintain good relationships with our key regulators and our current systems and controls are adequate we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of any applicable laws and regulations while we strive to remain fullycompliant with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot guarantee that we will fully comply at all times with all laws and regulations especially in countries with developing or evolving legal systems or with evolving or extraterritorial regulations in particular given the challenges of integrating operations many of which are decentralized we cannot assure that our newlyacquired entities’ business systems and controls have prevented or will prevent any and all violations of applicable laws or regulations 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology and analytics to drive value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology analytics and related tools

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology and analytic solutions that anticipate lead or keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely and costeffective manner or in attracting personnel with the necessary skills in this area additionally our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies or analytic techniques in our business requires us to incur significant cost and attract qualified technical talent who are in high demand our competitors are seeking to develop competing or new technologies and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions if we cannot offer new technologies or analytic services or solutions as quickly or effectively as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or analytic tools it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements 

our business may be harmed by any negative developments that may occur in the insurance industry or if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers

many of our businesses are heavily dependent on the insurance industry any negative developments that occur in the insurance industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations in addition if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers it may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

the private health insurance industry in the us has experienced a substantial amount of consolidation over the past several years resulting in a decrease in the number of insurance carriers in the future it may become necessary for us to offer insurance plans from a reduced number of insurance carriers or to derive a greater portion of our revenue from a more concentrated number of carriers as our business and the health insurance industry continue to evolve the termination amendment or consolidation of our relationships with our insurance carriers could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes and developments in the health insurance system in the united states could harm our business

in 2010 the federal government enacted significant reforms to healthcare legislation through healthcare reform many of our lines of business depend upon the private sector of the us insurance system its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use of and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance plans healthcare reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the industry in which we operate in substantial ways any changes to the roles of the private and public sectors in the health insurance system could also substantially change the industry

the current administration and certain key members of congress have expressed a desire to replace or amend all or a portion of healthcare reform in addition various aspects of healthcare reform have been challenged in the judicial system with some success any partial or complete repeal or amendment judicial modifications or implementation difficulties or uncertainty regarding such events could increase our costs of compliance prevent or delay future adoption or revisions to our exchange platform and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition certain key members of congress have otherwise expressed a desire to establish alternatives to employersponsored health insurance or replace it with governmentsponsored health insurance given the uncertainties relating to the potential repeal and replacement of healthcare reform or other alternative proposals related to health insurance plans the impact is difficult to determine but it could have material negative effects on us including

 













any of these effects could materially harm our business and results of operations for example the manner in which the federal government and the states implement health insurance exchanges and the process for receiving subsidies and costsharing credits could substantially increase our competition and member turnover and substantially reduce the number of individuals who purchase insurance through us various aspects of healthcare reform could cause insurance carriers to limit the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell and the geographies in which we are able to sell them in addition the us congress may seek to find spending cuts and such cuts may include medicare if cuts are made to medicare there may be substantial changes in the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell changes in the law could also cause insurance carriers to exit the business of selling insurance plans in a particular jurisdiction to eliminate certain categories of products or to attempt to move members into new plans for which we receive lower commissions if insurance carriers decide to limit our ability to sell their plans or determine not to sell individual health insurance plans altogether our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed 

limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others

we cannot guarantee that trade secret trademark and copyright law protections are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property including our software which may become an increasingly important part of our business existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights also we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot be sure that our services and products or the products of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients these claims may harm our reputation result in financial liability consume financial resources to pursue or defend and prevent us from offering some services or products 

 

financial and tax risks 

we have material pension liabilities that can fluctuate significantly and adversely affect our financial position or net income or result in other financial impacts

we have material pension liabilities some of which represent unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement liabilities movements in the interest rate environment investment returns inflation or changes in other assumptions that are used to estimate our benefit obligations and other factors could have a material effect on the level of liabilities in these plans at any given time most pension plans have minimum funding requirements that may require material amounts of periodic additional funding and accounting requirements that may result in increased pension expense for example in 2018 we were required to recognize a £ 31 million 40 million pension settlement expense related to the accelerated recognition of certain accumulated losses in one of our uk pension schemes following the transfer out of assets of certain plan participants depending on the above factors among others we could be required to recognize further pension expense in the future increased pension expense could adversely affect our earnings or cause earnings volatility in addition the need to make additional cash contributions may reduce our financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or other needs of our business 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility and we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all

willis towers watson had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 46 billion as of december 31 2018 and our interest expense was 208 million for the year ended december 31 2018

although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may







the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments the operating restrictions and financial covenants in our credit facilities do and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that is not cured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

the maintenance and growth of our business depends on our access to capital which will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing also we could be at risk to rising interest rates in the future to the extent that we borrow at floating rates under our existing borrowing agreements or refinance existing debt at higher rates there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

a downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility and under certain circumstances may require us to offer to buy back some of our outstanding debt 

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility in addition certain downgrades would trigger a stepup in interest rates under the indentures for certain of our senior notes which would increase our interest expense if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources

in addition under the indenture for our 3600 senior notes due 2024 our 4625 senior notes due 2023 our 6125 senior notes due 2043 our 3500 senior notes due 2021 our 4400 senior notes due 2026 our 2125 senior notes due 2022 our 4500 senior notes due 2028 and our 5050 senior notes due 2048 if we experience a ratings decline together with a change of control event we would be required to offer to purchase these notes from holders unless we had previously redeemed those notes we may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

if a us person is treated as owning at least 10 of our shares such a holder may be subject to adverse us federal income tax consequences

as a result of us tax reform many of our nonus subsidiaries are now classified as ‘controlled foreign corporations’ ‘cfcs’ for us federal income tax purposes due to the expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules within a multinational corporate group if a us person is treated as owning directly indirectly or constructively at least 10 of the value or voting power of our shares such a person may be treated as a ‘us shareholder’ with respect to one or more of our cfc subsidiaries in addition if our shares are treated as owned more than 50 by us shareholders we would be treated as a cfc a us shareholder of a cfc may be required to annually report and include in its us taxable income as ordinary income its prorata share of ‘subpart f income’ ‘global intangible lowtaxed income’ and investments in us property by cfcs whether or not we make any distributions to such us shareholder an individual us shareholder generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a corporate us shareholder with respect to a cfc a failure by a us shareholder to comply with its reporting obligations may subject the us shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may extend the statute of limitations with respect to the us shareholder’s us federal income tax return for the year for which such reporting was due we cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our nonus subsidiaries are cfcs or whether any investor is a us shareholder with respect to any such cfcs we also cannot guarantee that we will furnish to us shareholders any or all of the information that may be necessary for them to comply with the aforementioned obligations us investors should consult their own advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments in us 

legislative or regulatory action in the us or abroad could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate

we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from expectations and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the ‘us tax reform’ which generally became effective on january 1 2018 the us tax reform included numerous changes to existing tax law including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 among other things us tax reform could cause us to lose the benefit of certain tax credits and deductions limit our ability to deduct interest incurred in the us and potentially increase our income taxes due to the base erosion and antiabuse tax the us treasury department has issued a number of proposed regulations clarifying some of the provisions of the us tax reform which are expected to be finalized in 2019 we will continue to evaluate the overall impact of us tax reform and related regulations on our operations and tax position over the next twelve months our expectations of the impact of us tax reform are also subject to change possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretation or assumptions andor updated regulatory guidance the us tax reform could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

 

further legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely or otherwise affect the taxes that the us imposes on our worldwide operations regulations or administrative guidance from the us treasury department that are currently proposed or newly issued in the future could have similar consequences such changes could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant additional expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that have the effect of limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise experience business detriment 

in addition the us congress the organisation for economic cooperation and development ‘oecd’ the world trade organization and other government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of ‘base erosion and profit shifting’ where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates in october 2015 the oecd released final reports addressing fifteen specific actions as part of a comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting although the timing and methods of implementation vary several jurisdictions have enacted legislation that is aligned with and in some cases exceeds the scope of the oecd’s recommendations as a result the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various other risks that could impact our business

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside of the us accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or us dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws additionally and as noted above the unknown impacts of brexit may expose us to additional exchange rate fluctuations in the pound sterling

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside of the us and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in local currencies

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenue and expenses together with any net pound sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollar denominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure while we do utilize hedging strategies to attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective 

changes in accounting principles or in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us gaap any change to accounting principles particularly to us gaap could have a material adverse effect on us or our results of operations 

us gaap accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to revenue recognition valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients discretionary compensation incurredbutnotreported liabilities restructuring pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates and changes in accounting standards could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations

 

in addition we have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed and we significantly increased goodwill as a result of the merger we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

our quarterly revenue could fluctuate including as a result of factors outside of our control while our expenses are relatively fixed

quarterly variations in our revenue and results of operations have occurred in the past and could occur as a result of a number of factors such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter seasonality of certain types of services the number of business days in a quarter colleague hiring and utilization rates our clients’ ability to terminate engagements without penalty the size and scope of assignments and general economic conditions

we derive significant revenue from commissions for brokerage services but do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in the premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission levels may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenue and operating margin we could be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions in addition insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as us the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability

a sizeable portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed encompassing the majority of administrative occupancy communications and other expenses depreciation and amortization and salaries and employee benefits excluding fiscal yearend incentive bonuses therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments or our inability to forecast demand can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results and could result in losses and volatility in our stock price 

it is unclear how increased regulatory oversight and changes in the method for determining the london interbank offered rate ‘libor’ may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to libor or how such changes could affect our results of operations or financial condition

in the recent past concerns have been publicized regarding the calculation of libor the london interbank offered rate which present risks for the financial instruments that use libor as a reference rate libor is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the london interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally 

accordingly uncertainty as to the nature of such changes may affect the market for or pricing of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations in addition any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor which could have an impact on the market for or pricing of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us including our revolving credit facility or on our overall financial condition or results of operations for example on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 at this time it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere

 

the laws of ireland differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders for repurchasing shares of common stock and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries for example willis limited our uk brokerage subsidiary regulated by the fca is currently required to maintain 140 million in unencumbered and available financial resources of which at least 79 million must be in cash for regulatory purposes in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on or repurchase shares of common stock

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate

there are no governmental laws decrees or regulations in ireland that restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to nonresident holders of the company’s shares

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the united states should be exempt from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from irish dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends

with respect to noncorporate us shareholders certain dividends from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradeable on an established securities market in the united states such as our shares noncorporate us shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as investment income pursuant to section 163d4 of the code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation in addition the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances

we are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account

we derive the majority of our revenue from either commissions or fees for broking or consulting services no single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenue for any of the periods presented

our shares are traded on the nasdaq global select market

 

market conditions 

due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission revenue may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating margin a ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our revenue and operating margin rates however vary by geography industry and client segment as a result and due to the global and diverse nature of our business we view rates in the aggregate

market conditions in the broking industry in which we operate are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world insurance rate movements and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients

management has considered the uk referendum vote on june 23 2016 to depart from the eu the triggering of article 50 of the treaty of lisbon providing the right to and procedures for a member to leave the eu on march 29 2017 the early general election held on june 8 2017 and the uncertainties about the nearterm and longerterm effects of brexit on the company the terms of brexit and its impact remain uncertain and the company is currently in the process of establishing appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business for a further discussion of the risks of brexit to the company see part i item 1a risk factors within this annual report on form 10k

typically our business benefits from regulatory change political risk or economic uncertainty insurance broking generally tracks the economy but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty we have some businesses such as our health and benefits and administration businesses which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change

although approximately 23 of our revenue is generated in the uk on an annual basis only about 13 of revenue is denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 21 of our expenses is denominated in pounds sterling thus we generally benefit from a weakening pound sterling in our income from operations however we have a company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency

the markets for our consulting technology and solutions and marketplace services are subject to changes as a result of economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors we believe that the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs with regard to the market for exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform part of the employersponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase as these market segments continue to evolve we may experience growth in intervals with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth in recent years growth in the market for exchanges has slowed and we expect this trend may continue during 2019

transaction and integration expenses for the year ended december 31 2018 were 202 million compared to 269 million for the year ended december 31 2017 a decrease of 67 million or 25 the higher costs in the prior year primarily resulted from the settlement of the mergerrelated appraisal demand lawsuit which was settled in the third quarter of 2017 see part ii item 8 note 14 commitments and contingencies in our annual report on form 10k filed with the sec on february 28 2018 as amended on june 6 2018 for more details the decrease in expenses in 2018 was also due to the completion of certain integration activities in connection with the merger transaction and integration expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 were 269 million which consists of costs associated with our information technology and finance initiatives and rationalization property consolidation benefits harmonization and costs associated with the settlement of the mergerrelated appraisal demand lawsuit transaction and integration expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 were 177 million approximately 162 million of these expenses were related to the merger and 15 million were related to the acquisition of gras savoye 

income from operations

income from operations for the year ended december 31 2018 was 809 million compared to 516 million for the year ended december 31 2017 an increase of 293 million adjusting for the impact of asc 606 which reduced operating income in 2018 by 98 million income from operations would have increased by 391 million this increase was due to continued organic revenue growth across all segments income from operations for the year ended december 31 2017 was 516 million compared to 348 million for the year ended december 31 2016 an increase of 168 million or 48 this increase resulted primarily from additional revenue of 315 million driven by growth across all segments partially offset by additional costs resulting primarily from our integration activities and additional salary and benefits costs 

interest expense

interest expense for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 was 208 million 188 million and 184 million respectively interest expense is primarily related to interest on our senior notes and term loans interest expense increased by 20 million for the year ended december 31 2018 which resulted from higher average outstanding debt balances during the year higher interest rates attributable to the variablerate portion of our outstanding debt and higher fixedrate interest associated with the issuance of new senior notes during the current year interest expense increased by 4 million for the year ended december 31 2017 over the prior year which primarily resulted from additional levels of indebtedness 

other income net

as a result of the adoption of asu 201707 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost  which was retrospectively applied to our 2017 and 2016 presentations as well we now classify all components of net periodic benefit cost except service cost resulting from our defined benefit plans in this line item other income net additionally includes other gains and losses including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 

other income net for the year ended december 31 2018 was 250 million compared to 164 million for the year ended december 31 2017 an increase of 86 million the additional income in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily related to increased pension benefit income of 58 million for full year 2018 in comparison with the prior year and favorable foreign exchange activity primarily occurring in the second quarter of 2018 of approximately 48 million other income net for the year ended december 31 2017 was 164 million compared to 178 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the lower income was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange activity of approximately 43 million

provision forbenefit from income taxes

provision forbenefit from income taxes for the year ended december 31 2018 was a provision of 136 million compared with benefits of 100 million and 96 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the impact of us tax reform which included a net benefit of 204 million due to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and remeasurement of net us deferred tax liabilities primarily related to acquisitionbased intangibles the benefit from income taxes in 2016 was primarily due to the release of a portion of us valuation allowances and shifts in the global mix of income as a result of the merger this shift resulted in additional deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates which reduced the global effective tax rate the effective tax rates for the years ended 

 

december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 were 160 205 and 281 respectively these effective tax rates are calculated using ext ended values from our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are therefore more precise tax rates than can be calculated from rounded values 

prior to us tax reform our effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to our global mix of income and deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates for 2018 while the us federal corporate income tax rate has decreased as a result of us tax reform certain deferred tax benefits realized as a result of both the merger and deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates have now been reduced as well this offsets in part the benefit of us tax reform thus increasing our income tax rate

net income attributable to willis towers watson

net income attributable to willis towers watson for the year ended december 31 2018 was 695 million compared to 568 million for the year ended december 31 2017 an increase of 127 million or 22 adjusting for the impact of asc 606 which reduced net income in 2018 by 80 million net income attributable to willis towers watson would have increased by 207 million this increase was due to strong organic revenue growth across all segments net income attributable to willis towers watson for the year ended december 31 2017 was 568 million compared to 420 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily driven by an improvement of 168 million in income from operations partially offset by a 14 million decrease in other income net 

supplemental information – adoption of new revenue standard

as discussed in note 4 — revenue within item 8 in this annual report on form 10k the company adopted asc 606 as of january 1 2018 since the company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method we have provided the impact to the affected financial statement line items within the consolidated financial statements for 2018 the 2017 and 2016 comparative financial statement line items have not been restated in accordance with the new standard in an effort to help the readers of this form 10k better understand the impact that this guidance has on our reported segment results we have included below the revenue and operating income by segment as reported as well as without the adoption of asc 606 and brief explanations of the changes amounts exclude results not allocated to the operating segments



 

explanation of changes

revenue and operating expense amounts differ due to the adoption of asc 606 as well as how the new standard reflects the timing of our operating results therefore the following significant changes may also reflect differences between quarters as well as fiscal years



 











impact of us tax reform

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as ‘us tax reform’ us tax reform makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that may be payable over eight years 2 bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property 3 reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 4 a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income ‘gilti’ which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ‘ftcs’ and a deduction of up to 50 to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 5 a new limitation on deductible interest expense 6 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 7 limitations on the use of ftcs to reduce the us income tax liability 8 the creation of the base erosion antiabuse tax ‘beat’ a new minimum tax and 9 a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries

also on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 ‘sab 118’ which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the us tax reform sab 118 provided a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the us tax reform enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 income taxes ‘asc 740’ in accordance with sab 118 a company was required to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of us tax reform for which the accounting under asc 740 was complete adjustments to incomplete and unknown amounts were required to be recorded and disclosed during the measurement period to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of us tax reform was incomplete but it was able to determine a reasonable estimate a provisional estimate in the financial statements was required to be recorded if a company was unable to determine a provisional estimate it was required to continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of us tax reform 

while the measurement period under sab 118 is now closed the company may in future periods need to further refine its us federal and state calculations related to us tax reform as the taxing authorities provide additional guidance and clarification however as of december 31 2018 the companys accounting for us tax reform is complete based on its interpretation of the guidance issued as of the balance sheet date

 

as such the company has revised and finalized the provisional adjustments for the following items 

reduction of the federal corporate tax rate – beginning january 1 2018 the company’s us income is taxed at a 21 federal corporate tax rate under asc 740 deferred tax assets or liabilities must be recalculated as of the enactment date using current tax laws and rates expected to be in effect when the deferred tax items reverse in future periods which is 21 consequently the company recorded a provisional decrease in its net deferred tax liabilities of 208 million with a corresponding deferred income tax benefit of 208 million during the year ended december 31 2017 on october 12 2018 the company filed its 2017 us federal corporate income tax return after refining our analysis of those items directly related to us tax reform the company recorded additional deferred tax benefit of approximately 8 million related to deferred tax items that are now subject to tax at 21 the effect of the measurement period adjustment on the 2018 effective tax rate is approximately 1 

onetime transition tax – the onetime transition tax is based on the company’s total post1986 earnings and profits ‘ep’ that it previously deferred from us income taxes at december 31 2017 the company recorded a provisional amount for the onetime transition tax liability for our foreign subsidiaries owned by us corporate shareholders resulting in an increase in us federal income tax expense of 70 million and state income tax expense of 2 million this transition tax liability was recorded as a longterm liability in the 2017 financial statements subsequent to the december 31 2017 reporting period the internal revenue service ‘irs’ clarified the application of the ‘with’ and ‘without’ approach for calculating the transition tax liability in determining the amount payable over eight years based on this guidance the company revised its provisional estimate for the us federal transition tax liability in the first quarter of 2018 which was reduced by 64 million due to the utilization of interest loss carryforwards resulting from the transition tax income inclusion this reduction has no impact on the 2018 effective tax rate additionally on the basis of revised ep computations that were completed during the year ended december 31 2018 we recognized an additional increase to income tax expense of 8 million which was recorded in current income tax payable this has an approximate 1 impact on the company’s 2018 effective tax rate the tax expense recorded includes the final measurement period adjustment related to the company’s november 30 2018 foreign subsidiaries while the measurement period under sab 118 is now closed we may in future periods need to further refine the us federal and state transition tax calculations of the november 30 2018 foreign subsidiaries as the taxing authorities provide additional guidance and clarification 

indefinite reinvestment assertion – beginning in 2018 us tax reform provides a 100 deduction for dividends received from 10percent owned foreign corporations by us corporate shareholders subject to a oneyear holding period although dividend income is now exempt from us federal tax for us corporate shareholders companies must still account for the tax consequences of outside basis differences and other tax impacts of their investments in nonus subsidiaries at december 31 2017 we analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation and determined we might repatriate up to 219 million which was previously deemed indefinitely reinvested for those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation we recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes of 1 million in addition we remeasured the existing deferred tax liability accrued on certain acquired towers watson subsidiaries and released the associated deferred tax liability this resulted in an income tax benefit of 76 million as these foreign earnings were subject to the onetime transition tax these estimates are now considered final and no further adjustments have been made in the year ended december 31 2018 as a result of us tax reform 

bonus depreciation – the company completed its determination of all capital expenditures that qualify for immediate expensing for the year ended december 31 2017 the company recorded a provisional deduction of 40 million based on its current intent to fully expense all qualifying expenditures this resulted in an increase of approximately 14 million to the companys us federal current income taxes receivable and a corresponding increase in its net deferred tax liabilities of approximately 14 million however as a result of further analysis on assets placed in service after september 27 2017 the company concluded its tax deduction to be 8 million the tax deduction was reflected on the company’s 2017 us federal corporate income tax return filed on october 12 2018 the effect of the measurementperiod adjustment on the 2018 effective tax rate is included in the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate above 

executive compensation – starting with compensation paid in 2018 section 162m will limit the company from deducting compensation including performancebased compensation in excess of 1 million paid to anyone who starting in 2018 serves as the chief executive officer or chief financial officer or who is among the three most highly compensated executive officers the only exception to this rule is for compensation that is paid pursuant to a 

 

binding contract in effect on november 2 2017 that would have otherwise been deductible under the prior section 162m rules accordingly any compensation paid in the future pursuant to new compensation arrangements entered into after november 2 2017 even if performancebased will count towards the 1 million deduction limit if paid to a covered executive the company recorded a provisional income tax expense of 8 million relating to our compensation plans not qualifying as a binding contract exception during the fourth quarter the company finalized its analysis and review of the executive compensation plans and irs guidance released throughout the year the company has concluded that the reviewed plans are not subject to future limitation under the binding contract exception and gr andfathering rules this resulted in the reestablishment of the deferred tax asset through the recording of an income tax benefit of 8 million the effect of the measurement period adjustment on the 2018 effective tax rate is approximately 1 

gilti – us tax reform creates a new requirement that certain income ie gilti earned by controlled foreign corporations ‘cfcs’ must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholders gilti is the excess of the shareholder’s ‘net cfc tested income’ over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of 1 10 percent of the aggregate of the us shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc with respect to which it is a us shareholder over 2 the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfctested income under us gaap the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the ‘period cost method’ or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the ‘deferred method’ the company has concluded it is treating the taxes due on us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the ‘period cost method’ the estimated tax impact of gilti net of available foreign tax credits is approximately 15 million at december 31 2018 

valuation allowances – the company has concluded there have been no changes to valuation allowances as a result of us tax reform 

 

liquidity and capital resources

executive summary

our principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities or new debt offerings

based on our balance sheets cash flows current market conditions and information available to us at this time we believe that willis towers watson has sufficient liquidity which includes our undrawn revolving credit facilities to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months including investing in the business for growth creating value through the integration of willis towers watson and gras savoye scheduled debt repayments dividend payments and contemplated share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors 

the company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments beginning in 2016 as a result of our plan to restructure or distribute accumulated earnings of certain acquired towers watson foreign operations we accrued deferred taxes on the historical and current year earnings of those subsidiaries the historical cumulative earnings of our other subsidiaries had been reinvested indefinitely and therefore we had not provided deferred tax liabilities on these amounts 

at december 31 2018 we analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation for those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation we have recorded an estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital longterm investment requirements or additional guidance relating to us tax reform necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for income and foreign withholding taxes net of credits may be necessary other potential sources of cash may be through the settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a taxefficient manner

 

events that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results potential future acquisitions or divestitures material changes in geographic sources of cash unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets 

during the year ended december 31 2018 we completed an offering of 600 million of 4500 senior notes due 2028 and 400 million of 5050 senior notes due 2048 net proceeds of 989 million were used to prepay in full 127 million outstanding under our term loan due december 2019 and to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under our 125 billion revolving credit facility

assets and liabilities associated with nonus entities have been translated into us dollars as of december 31 2018 at us dollar rates that fluctuate compared to historical periods as a result cash flows derived from changes in the consolidated balance sheets include the impact of the change in foreign exchange translation rates

cash and cash equivalents

additionally at december 31 2018 11 billion was available to draw against our 125 billion revolving credit facility as compared to 362 million which was available to draw against the facility at december 31 2017

nongaap financial measures

in order to assist readers of our consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that willis towers watson’s management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes we present the following nongaap measures and their most directly comparable us gaap measure

 



 

the company believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance and in the case of free cash flow our liquidity results

 

additionally in 2018 we adopted asc 606 which has a material impact on the amount timing and classification of certain revenue and costs included in our consolidated financial statements since the company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method the 2018 financial information is presented on the basis of the asc 606 adoption however the 2017 and prior comparative financial data has not been restated in accordance with the new standard in an effort to help the readers of this form 10k better understand the impact that this guidance had on our nongaap measures we have presented these measures as reported as well as without the adoption of asc 606 and a brief explanation of the changes

 

furthermore the compensation for senior executives under certain longterm incentive programs is determined based on the results of our nongaap measures for the period 2016 through 2018 calculated without the adoption of asc 606 therefore to ensure transparency we consider it necessary to also provide the nongaap measures without the adoption of asc 606 this will enable financial statement users the ability to evaluate management’s performance based on the same elements utilized for performancebased remuneration

 

within the measures referred to as ‘adjusted’  we adjust for significant items which will not be settled in cash or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations these items include the following 



















these nongaap measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies nongaap measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for the information contained within our consolidated financial statements

adjusted revenue

we consider adjusted revenue to be an important financial measure which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors

adjusted revenue is defined as total revenue adjusted for the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions us gaap accounting requires the elimination of this revenue

we have included the reconciliation of total revenue to adjusted revenue in the table below together with our reconciliation of the resulting revenue change to the constant currency and organic changes

 

constant currency change and organic change 

we evaluate our revenue on an as reported us gaap constant currency and organic basis we believe presenting constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally





the constant currency and organic change results and a reconciliation from the reported results for consolidated revenue are included in the ‘consolidated revenue’ section within this form 10k these measures are also reported by segment in the ‘segment revenue’ section within this form 10k

a reconciliation of the reported changes to the constant currency and organic changes for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 is as follows

 



 



a reconciliation of revenue to adjusted revenue and reconciliation of the reported changes to the constant currency and organic changes for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 is as follows

 



 

i components of revenue change may not add due to rounding

 

adjusted operating income

we consider adjusted operating income to be an important financial measure which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors

 

adjusted operating income is defined as income from operations adjusted for amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results 

reconciliations of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 are as follows

 



 

adjusted operating income without the adoption of asc 606 increased for the year ended december 31 2018 to 16 billion from 15 billion for the year ended december 31 2017 as a result of strong organic revenue growth from increased client demand across all segments additionally on a yeartodate basis salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue decreased

adjusted operating income for the year ended december 31 2017 increased to 15 billion from 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 an increase of 92 million or 6 income from operations increased by 168 million primarily due to revenue growth across all segments partially offset by higher salaries and benefits costs the year ended december 31 2016 also included settlement income of £28 million 41 million related to the fine arts jewellery and specie team

adjusted ebitda

we consider adjusted ebitda to be an important financial measure which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations to benchmark our operating results against our competitors and to evaluate and measure our performancebased compensation plans

adjusted ebitda is defined as net income adjusted for provision for income taxes interest expense depreciation and amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses gainloss on disposal of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results

 

reconciliations of net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 are as follows 

 



 

adjusted ebitda without the adoption of asc 606 for the year ended december 31 2018 was 22 billion compared to 19 billion for the year ended december 31 2017 this increase was primarily due to organic revenue growth across all segments increased pension credits and lower foreign exchange losses on a yeartodate basis

 

adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2017 was 19 billion compared to 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase in adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to revenue growth across all segments partially offset by higher salary and benefits costs the year ended december 31 2016 also included settlement income of £28 million 41 million related to the fine arts jewellery and specie team

adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share

adjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to willis towers watson adjusted for amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses gainloss on disposal of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results the related tax effect of those adjustments and the tax effects of internal reorganizations and us tax reform this measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share

adjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock diluted adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors

 

reconciliations of net income attributable to willis towers watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 are as follows 

 



 





our adjusted diluted earnings per share without the adoption of asc 606 increased for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to organic revenue growth across all segments increased pension credits and lower foreign exchange losses on a yeartodate basis

 

our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to revenue growth across all segments partially offset by higher salary and benefits costs the prior year also included settlement income of £28 million 41 million related to the fine arts jewellery and specie team 

adjusted income before taxes and adjusted income taxestax rate

adjusted income before taxes is defined as income from operations before income taxes adjusted for amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses gainloss on disposal of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate

adjusted income taxestax rate is defined as the provision for income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses gainloss on disposal of operations the tax effects of internal reorganizations and us tax reform and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results divided by adjusted income before taxes adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate

management believes that the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate that we would incur if not for the reduction of pretax income for the adjusted items the tax effects of our internal reorganizations and the tax effect of us tax reform which are not core to our current and future operations

reconciliations of income from operations before income taxes to adjusted income before taxes and provision forbenefit from income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 are as follows

 



 



 

our us gaap tax rate is lower than the us statutory tax rate of 21 prior to us tax reform this was primarily due to our global mix of income and deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates for 2018 while the us federal corporate income tax rate has decreased as a result of us tax reform certain deferred tax benefits realized as a result of both the merger and deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates have now been reduced as well this offsets in part the benefit of us tax reform thus increasing our income tax rate 

our us gaap tax rates without the adoption of asc 606 were 162 205 and 281 for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

our adjusted income tax rates without the adoption of asc 606 were 194 219 and 208 for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

free cash flow

free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use free cash flow is a liquidity measure and is not meant to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures

reconciliations of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 are as follows

 



the increase in free cash flows in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily resulted from increased cash from operations and cash collections from our customers as compared to the prior year

the decrease in free cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily resulted from higher capital expenditures and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle these discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to legacy towers watson colleagues due to the timing of the merger

critical accounting policies and estimates

these consolidated financial statements conform to us gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period our estimates judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates the areas that we believe are critical accounting policies include revenue recognition costs to fulfill broking contracts valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients discretionary compensation income taxes commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities pension assumptions and goodwill and intangible assets the critical accounting policies discussed below involve making difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations these critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption different estimates that we could have used or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition effective january 1 2018

we use significant estimates related to revenue recognition most commonly during our estimation of the transaction prices or where we recognize revenue over time on a proportional performance basis a brief description of these policies and estimates is included below

 

estimation of transaction prices — this process occurs most frequently in certain broking transactions in situations in which our fees are not fixed but are variable we must estimate the likely commission per policy taking into account the likelihood of cancellation before the end of the policy for medicare broking affinity arrangements and proportional treaty reinsurance broking the commissions to which we will be entitled can vary based on the underlying individual insurance policies that are placed for medicare broking and proportional treaty reinsurance in particular w e base the estimates of transaction prices on supportable evidence from an analysis of past transactions and only include amounts that are probable of being received or not refunded referred to as applying ‘constraint’ under asc 606 this results in us estimating a transaction price that may be significantly lower than the ultimate amount of commissions we may collect the transaction price is then adjusted over time as we receive confirmation of our remuneration through receipt of treaty statements  or as other information becomes available  

proportional performance basis over time recognition — where we recognize revenue on a proportional performance basis primarily in our consulting and outsourced administration arrangements the amount we recognize is affected by a number of factors that can change the estimated amount of work required to complete the project such as the staffing on the engagement andor the level of client participation our periodic engagement evaluations require us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stages of project completion that in turn affect how we recognize revenue we recognize a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than the total estimated costs associated with the engagement losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 

costs to fulfill broking contracts effective january 1 2018

for our broking business the company must estimate the fulfillment costs incurred during the preplacement of the broking contracts these judgments include









valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from a client’s failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered which are recorded in other operating expenses we also maintain allowances related to our unbilled receivables for such items as client disputes the related provision for which is recorded as a reduction to revenue our allowance policy is based on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on our writeoff history facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due general market conditions current economic trends and our clients’ ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables

discretionary compensation

our compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash andor deferred stock units after our annual operating results are finalized

an estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted if necessary by management to reflect changes in the forecast of prebonus profitability for the year

income taxes

the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the change is enacted deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as based 

 

on available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company adjusts valuation allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amount considered realizable in future periods if the company’s facts and assumptions change in making such determinations the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and the results of recent financial operations we place more reliance on evidence that is objectively verifiable 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities

we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance and consulting services in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice in certain cases where a range of loss exists we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount

see note 14 — commitments and contingencies in item 8 within this annual report on form 10k

pension assumptions

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in several countries with the most significant defined benefit plans offered in the us and uk our disclosures in note 13 — retirement benefits contain additional information about our other less significant but material retirement plans within our critical accounting policy discussion we have excluded analysis for plans outside of those noted in the description below as any variance of recorded information based on management’s estimates would be immaterial

descriptions of our us and uk plans which comprise 90 of our projected benefit obligations and 94 of our plan assets are below

united states

legacy willis – this plan was frozen in 2009 approximately onequarter of the legacy willis employees in the united states have a frozen accrued benefit under this plan

willis towers watson plan – substantially all us employees are eligible to participate in this plan benefits are provided under a stable value pension plan design the original stable value design came into effect on january 1 2012 existing plan participants as of july 1 2017 earn benefits without having to make employee contributions and all newly eligible employees after that date are required to contribute 2 of pay to participate in the plan

united kingdom

legacy willis – this plan covers approximately onethird of the legacy willis employees in the united kingdom the plan is now closed to new entrants new employees in the united kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan

legacy towers watson – benefit accruals earned under the legacy watson wyatt defined benefit plan predominantly pension benefits ceased on february 28 2015 although benefits earned prior to january 1 2008 retain a link to salary until the employee leaves the company benefit accruals earned under the legacy towers perrin defined benefit plan predominantly lump sum benefits were frozen on march 31 2008 all participants now accrue defined contribution benefits

legacy miller – the plan provides retirement benefits based on members’ salaries at the point at which they ceased to accrue benefits under the scheme

 

the determination of the company’s obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that given the longevity of the plans are longterm in focus a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation however certain of these changes such as changes in the discount rates and other actuarial assumptions are not recognized immediately in net income but are instead recorded in other comprehensive income the accumulated gains and losses not yet recognized in net income are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit costincome generally based on the average working life expectancy of each of the plan’s active participants to the extent that the net gains or losses as of the beginning of the year exceed 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation 

willis towers watson considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions including economic forecasts relevant benchmarks historical trends portfolio composition and peer company comparisons these assumptions used to determine our pension liabilities and pension expense are reviewed annually by senior management and changed when appropriate a discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas an expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or longterm target asset allocations are revised to calculate the discount rate we use the granular approach to determining service cost and interest cost the expected rate of return assumptions for all plans are supported by an analysis of the weightedaverage yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality and the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases

funding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes or as agreed to with the plan trustees for the uk plans since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes pension contributions are not equal to net periodic benefit cost

we recorded a combined 173 million net periodic benefit income for our us and uk plans for the year ended december 31 2018 for the us and uk plans the following table presents our estimated net periodic benefit income for 2019 and the impact to both plans of a 025 increase and decrease to both the expected return on assets ‘eroa’ and the discount rate assumptions and the projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2018 and the impact of a 025 increase and decrease to the discount rates

 



 

economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear

goodwill and intangible assets — impairment review

in applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with the remainder recorded as goodwill intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise the fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise

goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and the company had nine reporting units as of october 1 2018

during fiscal year 2018 the company performed step 1 of the twostep impairment test for all reporting units each of the reporting units estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values to perform the test we used valuation 

 

techniques to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit that fall under income or market approaches under the discounted cash flow method an income approach the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debtfree aftertax cash flows for a finite period of years key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management business risk and expected rates of return on capital the guideline company method a market approach develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publiclytraded companies key estimates and determination of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies obtaining forecast revenue and ebitda estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics under the similar transactions method a market approach actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units are used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units 

if the company was required to perform step 2 we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit used in step 1 to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination then the implied fair value of goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if goodwill is impaired for the year ended december 31 2018 we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill or intangibles

recent accounting pronouncements

while we are still in the process of analyzing the various asus issued by the fasb those which we believe will have a material impact to our financial statements are listed below see note 2 — basis of presentation significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements within item 8 of this form 10k for additional information

asu no 201602 ‘leases’

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases  which requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments the lease liability and a rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term additional asus have since been issued which provide amended and additional guidance for the implementation of asu no 201602 all related guidance has been codified into and is now known as asc 842 leases ‘asc 842’ asc 842 became effective for the company at the beginning of its 2019 calendar year at which time the company adopted it 

as a result of finalizing and analyzing our inventory of lease agreements to determine the full impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements processes and systems the company has determined the following





 









 





 




 item 7a quantitative and qualita tive disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 — basis of presentation significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements and note 10 — derivative financial instruments within item 8 of this form 10k

foreign exchange risk

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the united states we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earn revenue in several currencies but incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenue and expenses by currency in 2018

 



 

 

 



our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from







london market operations

the company’s primary foreign exchange risks in its london market operations arise from changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and pound sterling as its london market operations earn the majority of its revenue in us dollars but incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling and may also hold significant foreign currency asset or liability positions on its balance sheet in addition the london market operations earn significant revenue in euro and japanese yen

the foreign exchange risks in our london market operations are hedged to the extent that







 

intercompany lending between subsidiaries 

the company engages in intercompany borrowing and lending between subsidiaries primarily through our inhouse banking operations which give rise to foreign exchange exposure the company mitigates these risks though the use of shortterm foreign currency forward and swap transactions that offset the underlying exposure created when the borrower and lender have different functional currencies

translation risk

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenue and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts expiring in 2020 which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weightedaverage contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within three years

 



 

 



income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the united kingdom is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities

interest rate risk

the company has access to 125 billion under a revolving credit facility expiring march 7 2022 as of december 31 2018 130 million was drawn on this facility we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in us dollars pounds sterling and euros

as a result of our operating activities we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies we earn interest on these funds which is included in our consolidated financial statements as interest income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity at december 31 2018 we held 14 billion of fiduciary funds invested in interestbearing accounts if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 25 basis points interest earned on these invested fiduciary funds and therefore our interest income recognized would increase or decrease by approximately 4 million on an annualized basis

 

the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates the company’s previouslyheld interest rate swap derivatives matured during 2018 and it has not entered into additional interest rate hedging contracts as of december 31 2018 

 



 

 







credit risk and concentrations of credit risk

credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted the company currently does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties the company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk

concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents fiduciary funds accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value

the company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure these financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies

concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the company does business as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas management does not believe that significant risk exists in connection with the company’s concentrations of credit as of december 31 2018

competition 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with accenture plc aon plc arthur j gallagher  co brown  brown inc cognizant technology solutions corporation marsh  mclennan companies inc and robert half international inc as well as with numerous specialty regional and local firms marsh  mclennan companies and aon plc are the two other major providers of global risk management services competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and in some business lines marsh  mclennan companies and aon plc have greater market share than we do 

competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their 

own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services   

the human capital and risk management consulting industries are highly competitive we believe there are significant barriers to entry and we have developed competitive advantages in providing hr consulting and risk management consulting services we face strong competition from several sources   

our principal competitors in the pension consulting industry are mercer hr consulting a marsh  mclennan company and aon plc beyond these large players the global hr consulting industry is highly fragmented   

our major competitors in the insurance consulting and software industry include milliman oliver wyman a marsh  mclennan company the big four accounting firms and sungard aon buck consultants a conduent company connextions a united healthcare company mercer a marsh  mclennan company automatic data processing and fidelity are our primary competitors in the insurance exchange industry with the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act we also compete with the public exchanges currently run by the us federal and state governments we now compete with providers of accountbased health plans and consumerdirected benefits such as wageworks and healthequity   

the market for our services is subject to change as a result of economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors regulatory and legislative actions along with continuously evolving technological developments will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products we believe the primary factors in selecting an hr consulting or risk management services firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs with regard to the marketplace for individuals and active employee exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients a strong reputation for efficient execution a provider’s capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments and financing options and an innovative service delivery model and platform for our traditional consulting and risk management services and the rapidly evolving exchange products we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements these risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business the descriptions below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown to us could also impair our business operations financial condition or results if any of the risks and uncertainties below or other risks were to occur our business operations financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted with respect to the taxrelated consequences of acquisition ownership and disposal of ordinary shares you should consult with your own tax advisors     

strategic and operational risks 

our success largely depends on our ability to achieve our global business strategy and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer if the company were unable to successfully establish and execute on its strategy and generate anticipated revenue growth and cost savings and efficiencies 

our future growth profitability and cash flows largely depend upon our ability to successfully establish and execute our global business strategy as discussed under item 1 “business  business strategy” we seek to be an advisory broking and solutions provider of choice through an integrated global platform while we have confidence that our strategic plan reflects opportunities that are appropriate and achievable there is a possibility that our strategy may not deliver projected longterm growth in revenue and profitability due to inadequate execution incorrect assumptions global or local economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we operate suboptimal resource allocation or any of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section in pursuit of our growth strategy we may also invest significant time and resources into new product or service offerings and there is the possibility that these offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment the failure to continually develop and execute optimally on our global business strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

demand for our services could decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn increased competition or a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or prospects all of which could materially adversely affect us 

we can give no assurance that the demand for our services will grow or be maintained or that we will compete successfully with our existing competitors new competitors or our clients’ internal capabilities client demand for our services may change based on the clients’ needs and financial conditions among other factors 

our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve global financial markets may continue to experience disruptions including increased volatility and credit availability which could substantially impact our results while it is difficult to predict the consequences of any deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing our services or insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the potential for a significant insurer to fail be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients 

in addition the markets for our principal services are highly competitive our competitors include other insurance brokerage human capital and risk management consulting and actuarial firms and the human capital and risk management divisions of diversified professional services insurance brokerage and accounting firms and specialty regional and local firms 

competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and some competitors have greater market share in certain lines of business than we do some of our competitors have greater financial technical and marketing resources than us which could enhance their ability to finance acquisitions fund internal growth and respond more quickly to professional and technological changes new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge creating additional competition and gaining significant market share resulting in a loss of business for us and a corresponding decline in revenues and profit margin in order to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure we may have to lower our prices which would also have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin 

in addition competitors could develop competing technologies or product or service offerings that disrupt our industries any new technology or product or service offering including insurance companies selling their products directly to consumers or other insureds that reduces or eliminates the need for intermediaries in insurance or reinsurance sales transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further the increasing willingness of clients to either selfinsure or maintain a captive insurance company and the development of capital marketsbased solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs could also materially adversely affect us and our results of operations 

an example of a business that may be significantly impacted by changes in customer demand is our retirement consulting and actuarial business which comprises a substantial portion of our revenue and profit we provide clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans defined benefit pension plans generally require more actuarial services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools complex calculations to determine employer costs funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match 

liabilities and assets over long periods of time if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate or if we are unable to otherwise compensate for the decline in our business that results from employers moving away from defined benefit plans our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in addition the demand for many of our core benefit services including compliancerelated services is affected by government regulation and taxation of employee benefit plans significant changes in tax or social welfare policy or other regulations could lead some employers to discontinue their employee benefit plans including defined benefit pension plans thereby reducing the demand for our services a simplification of regulations or tax policy also could reduce the need for our services 

we could be subject to claims and lawsuits arising from our work which could materially adversely affect our reputation business and financial condition 

we depend in large part on our relationships with clients and our reputation for highquality services to secure future engagements clients that become dissatisfied with our services may terminate their business relationships with us and clients and third parties that claim they suffered damages caused by our services may bring lawsuits against us we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the provision of our services or the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims see note 13  commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k for examples of claims to which we are subject 

because we often assist our clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money including actuarial services asset management and the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may arise that allege our potential liability for all or part of the substantial amounts in question the nature of our work particularly our actuarial services necessarily involves the use of assumptions and the preparation of estimates relating to future and contingent events the actual outcome of which we cannot know in advance our actuarial and brokerage services also rely on substantial amounts of data provided by clients the accuracy and quality of which we cannot ensure in addition we could make computational software programming or data management errors in connection with the services we provide to clients 

clients may seek to hold us responsible for alleged errors or omissions relating to any of the brokerage advice and services we provide including when claims they submit to their insurance carriers are disputed or denied given that many of our clients have very high insurance policy limits to cover their risks alleged errors and omissions claims against us arising from disputed or denied claims are often significant moreover in various circumstances our brokerage investment and certain other types of business may not limit the maximum liability to which we may be exposed for claims involving alleged errors or omissions and as such we do not have limited liability for the work we provide to the associated clients 

further given that we frequently work with large pension funds and insurance companies as well as other large clients relatively small percentage errors or variances can create significant financial variances and result in significant claims for unintended or unfunded liabilities the risks from such variances or errors could be aggravated in an environment of declining pension fund asset values and insurance company capital levels in almost all cases our exposure to liability with respect to a particular engagement is substantially greater than the revenue opportunity that the engagement generates for us 

clients may seek to hold us responsible for the financial consequences of variances between assumptions and estimates and actual outcomes or for errors for example in the case of pension plan actuarial work a client’s claims might focus on the client’s alleged reliance on actuarial assumptions that it believes were unreasonable and based on such reliance the client made benefit commitments that it may later claim are not affordable or funding decisions that result in plan underfunding if and when actual outcomes vary from actuarial assumptions 

we also continue to create new products and services and to grow the business of providing products and services to institutional investors financial services companies and other clients the risk of claims from these lines of business and related products and services may be greater than from our core products or services and such claims may be for significant amounts 

we also provide advice on both asset allocation and selection of investment managers increasingly for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on both of these matters or we may serve in a fiduciary capacity either of which may increase liability exposure in addition the company recently launched affiliated investment funds with plans to launch additional funds over time given that our investment business may recommend affiliated investment funds or affirmatively invest such clients’ assets in such funds under delegated authority this may increase our liability exposure we may also be liable for actions of managers or other service providers to the funds further for certain clients we are responsible for some portions of cash and investment management including rebalancing of investment portfolios and guidance to third parties on 

the structure of derivatives and securities transactions asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and investment managers may underperform their benchmarks in both cases the investment return shortfall can be significant clients experiencing this underperformance including from our affiliated investment funds may assert claims against us and such claims may be for significant amounts in addition our failure to properly execute our role can cause monetary damage to our clients or such third parties for which we might be found liable and such claims may be for significant amounts our ability to contractually limit our potential liability may be limited in certain jurisdictions or markets or in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary duties or other alleged errors or omissions 

the ultimate outcome of all of the above matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the industries we operate in or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships in addition defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs 

as a highlyregulated company we are subject from time to time to inquiries or investigations by governmental agencies or regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we have also been and may continue to be subject to inquiries and investigations by federal state or other governmental agencies regarding aspects of our clients’ businesses or our own businesses especially regulated businesses such as our insurance broker securities brokerdealer and investment advisory services such inquiries or investigations may consume significant management time and result in regulatory sanctions fines or other actions as well as significant legal fees which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and liquidity 

examples of these inquiries or investigations are set forth in more detail in note 13  commitments and contingencies in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k these include 

 all of these items reflect an increased focus by regulators both in the uk and elsewhere on various aspects of the operations and affairs of our regulated businesses we are unable to predict the outcome of these inquiries or investigations any proposed changes that result from these investigations and inquiries or any other investigations inquiries or regulatory developments or any potential fines or enforcement action could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

allegations of conflicts of interest including in connection with accepting market derived income ‘mdi’ may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or reputation 

we could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest conflicts of interest exist or could exist any time the company or any of its employees has or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests this could occur for example when the company is providing services to multiple parties in connection with a transaction in addition as we provide more solutionsbased services there is greater potential for conflicts with advisory services managing conflicts of interest is an important issue for the company but can be a challenge for a large and complex company such as ours due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base we regularly address potential conflicts of interest including without limitation situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client if these are not carefully managed this then could lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests with attendant regulatory and reputational risks that could materially adversely affect us and our operations there is no guarantee that all potential conflicts of interest will be identified and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our professional reputation and result in legal liability which may have a material adverse effect on our business identifying 

conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult in the nearterm while we continue to bring together and integrate legacy willis legacy towers watson and gras savoye in addition we may encounter more conflicts of interest than anticipated in connection with the merger or the gras savoye acquisition and we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest 

in addition insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of placements we make for clients or by fees paid by clients intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers this revenue when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets as opposed to as corporate clients of the intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other nonmarket related services is commonly known as market derived income or ‘mdi’ mdi is another example of an area in which allegations of conflicts of interest may arise mdi takes a variety of forms including volume or profitbased contingent commissions facilities administration charges business development agreements and fees for providing certain data to carriers 

mdi creates various risks intermediaries in many markets have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ or their own interests ahead of their clients accordingly mdi may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest antitrust unfair competition and antibribery laws and regulations while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice and while we have established systems and controls to manage these risks we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be effective 

in addition the company recently launched affiliated investment funds with plans to launch additional funds over time given that our investment business may recommend affiliated investment funds or affirmatively invest such clients’ assets in such funds under delegated authority there may be a perceived conflict of interest while the company has processes procedures and controls in place intended to mitigate potential conflicts such perception could cause regulatory inquiries or could impact client demand and the business’ financial performance and our controls may not be effective in addition underperformance by our affiliated investment funds could lead to lawsuits by clients that were invested in such funds 

separately the cma investment consultancy market investigation and the fca wholesale market study are also both expected to examine various potential conflicts of interest in the investment consultancy and the wholesale insurance brokerage industries respectively there can be no assurances as to the outcome of these market investigations and market studies and the cma or fca may recommend or require significant changes in these industries or impose firmspecific remedies 

the failure or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions conflicts of interest may also arise in the future that could cause material harm to us 

damage to our reputation including due to failure of thirdparties on whom we rely to perform services could damage our businesses 

maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with clients and colleagues damage to our reputation could therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory action failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures allegations of conflicts of interest and unethical behavior negative publicity whether or not true may also result in harm to our prospects in addition the failure to deliver satisfactory service and quality in one line of business could cause clients to terminate the services we provide to that client in many other lines of business this risk has increased as the company has become larger and more complex 

in addition as part of providing services to clients and managing our business we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers our ability to perform effectively depends in part on the ability of these service providers to meet their obligations as well as on our effective oversight of their performance the quality of our services could suffer or we could be required to incur unanticipated costs if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as expected or their services are disrupted this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation as well as our business and results of operations 

we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger or related actions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the businesses 

since the merger was consummated in january 2016 we have endeavored to integrate the legacy towers watson legacy willis and legacy gras savoye businesses however our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger and related actions occurring around the time of the merger depends to a large extent on our ability to complete such integration the combination of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process requiring significant management attention the remaining integration process could disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively could restrict the 

realization of the full expected benefits in addition the overall integration may result in material unanticipated costs or other problems expenses liabilities loss of client relationships or revenue and diversion of management’s attention the failure to meet the challenges involved in completing the integration of the businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations further even if our operations are integrated successfully the full benefits of the transactions including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected benefits of the merger or the related actions and negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares 

the loss of key colleagues could damage or result in the loss of client relationships and could result in such colleagues competing against us 

our success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including key managers and colleagues in addition our success largely depends upon our colleagues’ abilities to generate business and provide quality services in particular our colleagues’ business relationships with our clients are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements labor markets have become more competitive globally as the economic outlook in many countries has improved and we have experienced intense competition for certain types of colleagues in the past as a result of the merger and otherwise we have lost colleagues who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise if we lose additional colleagues such as those it could result in such colleagues competing against us and could materially adversely affect our ability to secure and complete engagements which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational changes could impact our business results 

we have recently undergone several significant business and organizational changes including the merger the acquisitions of gras savoye and miller insurance services llp and our business restructuring program and multiyear operational improvement program there are also a number of other initiatives planned or ongoing to transform our processes and gain efficiencies in connection with these changes we are managing a number of largescale and complex projects while we have concluded that each of these large complex projects is necessary or desirable to the execution of the company’s business strategy we cannot guarantee that the collective effect of all of these projects will not adversely impact our business or results of operations effectively managing these organizational changes is critical to retaining talent servicing clients and our business success overall the failure to effectively manage such risks could adversely impact our resources or business or financial results 

data security breaches or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could result in material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

we depend on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners insurance carriersmarkets and clients additionally one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their customers andor employees our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks computer viruses hackers and other external hazards as well as improper or inadvertent staff behavior could expose confidential company and personal data systems and information to security breaches 

many of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from and supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors our thirdparty applications include enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services provided and maintained by thirdparty vendors these thirdparty applications store confidential and proprietary data of both the company and our clients we have processes designed to require thirdparty it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyberattack on a vendor’s information systems further the potential impact of a data breach of our thirdparty vendors’ systems increases as we move more of our and our clients’ data into our vendors’ cloud storage we engage in it outsourcing or we consolidate the group of thirdparty vendors that provide cloud storage or other it services for the company 

we have experienced a number of data incidents resulting from human error or malfeasance as well as attempts at unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our colleagues thirdparty service providers and vendors none of which to our knowledge have been material to our business or our clients over time the sophistication of the attacks against us has increased we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot entirely 

eliminate the risk of data security breaches improper access to or disclosure of confidential company or personally identifiable information our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we hold and protect it from theft computer viruses hackers or inadvertent loss 

if any person including any of our colleagues fails to comply with disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines or criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through systems failure accident employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our colleagues or third parties could result in significant additional expenses including expenses relating to notification of data security breaches and costs of credit monitoring services negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation as well as require substantial resources and effort of management thereby diverting management’s focus and resources from business operations in addition our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing customer expectations and legal or regulatory requirements in this area including changing legal or regulatory requirements that may be developed or revised due to the uk’s exit from the eu ‘brexit’ could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation or business 

the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving continue to become more sophisticated and complex and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for example the cyber division of the us federal bureau of investigation ‘fbi’ has noted that cyber criminals have targeted and may increasingly target assets held in health savings accounts and reimbursement accounts to fraudulently acquire the assets held in those accounts assets held in health savings accounts are expected to grow substantially over the next few years given the company’s move toward managing more of these assets ourselves as a nonbank custodian in connection with our benefits delivery and administration businesses our reputation could be harmed and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are the target of such fraud and it goes undetected for any period of time 

we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against fraud or unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss the everevolving threats mean we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate adapt enhance and otherwise improve our respective systems and processes and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all fraud data security breaches or misuses of data any future significant compromise or breach of our data security or fraud whether external or internal or misuse of client colleague supplier or company data could result in additional significant costs lost revenue opportunities fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation 

we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and the general data protection regulation ‘gdpr’ once it supersedes the directive on data protection in may 2018 regulations from other countries that prohibit the transmission of data outside of such country’s borders and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information gdpr significantly increases our responsibilities when handling personal data including without limitation requiring us to conduct privacy impact assessments restricting the transmission of data and requiring public disclosure of significant data breaches laws and regulations in this area are evolving and generally becoming more stringent for example the new york state department of financial services has issued cybersecurity regulations that outline a variety of required security measures for protection of data further a uk exit from the eu will increase uncertainty regarding applicable laws and regulations pending more clarity on the terms of that exit all of these evolving laws and regulations may restrict the manner in which we provide services to our clients increase the risk of noncompliance and impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breach power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations 

a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our 

business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability particularly if any of these problems occur during peak times 

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing hardware or systems could cause material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards and to be at the forefront of a range of technology relevant to our business 

in addition many of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from and supported upgraded and maintained by thirdparty vendors our thirdparty applications include enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services provided and maintained by thirdparty vendors these thirdparty applications store confidential and proprietary data of both the company and our clients a suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruption that could adversely impact our business 

if the data we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer hardware applications or software systems or the loss of skilled people with the knowledge needed to operate older systems or if we experience other disruptions this could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability 

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal regulatory cultural market operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries 

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal regulatory market operational and other risks our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets the possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses and financial results these risks include 

 our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government laws or regulations or if government laws or regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs 

a material portion of our revenues are affected by statutory or regulatory changes an example of a statutory or regulatory change that could materially impact us is any change to healthcare reform in the us the new administration   and certain key 

members of congress have expressed a desire to replace or amend all or a portion of the patient protection and affordable care act ‘ppaca’ and the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 ‘hcera’ which we refer to collectively as ‘healthcare reform’ while the us congress has not passed legislation replacing or significantly amending healthcare reform other than changes to the individual mandate such legislation or another version of healthcare reform could be implemented in the future if we are unable to adapt our services to potential new laws and regulations with respect to healthcare reform or otherwise our ability to provide effective services in these areas may be substantially impacted in addition more restrictive rules or interpretations of the centers for medicare and medicaid services marketing rules or judicial decisions that restrict or otherwise change existing provisions of us healthcare regulation could have a material adverse impact on our benefits delivery and administration business 

many areas in which we provide services are the subject of government regulation which is constantly evolving for example our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services are subject to regulation and supervision by national state or other authorities insurance laws in the markets in which we operate are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the markets in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these locations 

changes in government and accounting regulations in the us and the uk two of our principal geographic markets affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human capital programs may materially adversely affect the demand for or the profitability of various of our services in addition we have significant operations throughout the world which further subject us to applicable laws and regulations of countries outside the us and the uk changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators in particular countries including changes in administration and enforcement policies could require operational improvements or modifications which may result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business in those countries 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we comply with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the us the uk the eu and its member states and the other jurisdictions around the world in which we operate in addition we own an interest in a number of associates where we do not exercise management control over the last few years regulators across the world are increasingly seeking to regulate brokers who operate in their jurisdictions the foreign and us laws and regulations applicable to our operations are complex continually evolving and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings these laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations competition law regulations economic and trade sanctions laws relating to countries in which certain subsidiaries do business or may do business “sanctioned jurisdictions” such as cuba iran russia sudan and syria anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act 2010 and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us as well as laws and regulations related to data privacy and cyber security because of changes in regulation and company practice our nonus subsidiaries are providing more services with connections to various countries including some sanctioned jurisdictions that our us subsidiaries are unable to perform 

in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies monetary fines injunctions revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients while we believe that we have substantially increased our focus on the geographic breadth of regulations to which we are subject maintain good relationships with our key regulators and our current systems and controls are adequate we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of any applicable laws and regulations while we strive to remain fullycompliant with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot guarantee that we will fully comply at all times with all laws and regulations especially in countries with developing or evolving legal systems or with evolving or extraterritorial regulations in particular given the challenges of integrating operations many of which are decentralized we cannot assure that our newlyacquired entities’ business systems and controls have prevented or will prevent any and all violations of applicable laws or regulations 

the decision by the united kingdom to leave the european union and the risk that other countries may follow could adversely affect us 

in 2017 approximately 22 of our revenues are generated in the uk although only about 13 of revenues are denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 19 of our expenses are denominated in pounds sterling given the status of brexit at this time we are not able to predict the impact that it will have on the economy economic regulatory and political stability and market conditions in europe including in the uk or on pound sterling euro or other european currencies but any such impacts and others we cannot currently anticipate could materially adversely affect us and our operations among other things we could experience lower growth in the region due to indecision as businesses hold off on generating new projects or due to adverse market conditions and reduced reported revenues and earnings because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars due to the fact that we translate revenue denominated in nonus currencies such as pounds sterling into us dollars for our financial statements in addition there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective 

the british government began negotiating the terms of the uks future relationship with the eu in 2017 while certain separation issues have been resolved there is still significant uncertainty with respect to the terms of the future relationship between the eu and the uk although we cannot anticipate what those terms will be the company is heavily invested in and focused on the uk in our businesses and activities if brexit negatively impacts the uk then it could have a material adverse impact on us in addition brexit may result in greater restrictions on business between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities this and other factors could cause us to move businesses or operations outside of the uk there is also uncertainty as to how the uks access to the eu single market and the wider trading legal regulatory tax and labor environments especially in the uk and eu will be impacted including the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients any such changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results for example any changes to the passporting or other regulations relating to doing business in various eu countries by relying on a regulatory permission in the uk or doing business in the uk by relying on a regulatory permission in an eu country could increase our costs of doing business or our ability to do so as another example changes in labor laws may impact the ability to hire and retain nonuk staff in the uk or uk staff in the eu in addition the outcome of the referendum has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the uk among other things it is unclear whether the uk will enact legislation similar to the pending european general data protection regulation after brexit and how data transfers to and from the uk will be regulated a change in such regulations or other regulations could increase our costs of doing business or in some cases our ability to do business and adversely impact our operations and financial results 

there is also a risk that other countries may decide to leave the eu we cannot predict the impact that any additional countries leaving the eu will have on us but any such impacts could materially adversely affect us 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology and analytics to drive value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology analytics and related tools 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology and analytic solutions that anticipate lead or keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely and costeffective manner and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies or analytic techniques in our business requires us to incur significant cost our competitors are seeking to develop competing technologies and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions if we cannot offer new technologies or analytic services or solutions as quickly or effectively as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or analytic tools it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements 

our business may be harmed by any negative developments that may occur in the insurance industry or if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers 

many of our businesses are heavily dependent on the insurance industry any negative developments that occur in the insurance industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations in addition if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers it may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the private health insurance industry in the us has experienced a substantial amount of consolidation over the past several years resulting in a decrease in the number of insurance carriers in the future it may become necessary for us to offer insurance plans from a reduced number of insurance carriers or to derive a greater portion of our revenues from a more concentrated number of carriers as our business and the health insurance industry evolve the termination amendment or 

consolidation of our relationship with our insurance carriers could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes and developments in the health insurance system in the united states could harm our business 

in 2010 the federal government enacted significant reforms to healthcare legislation through healthcare reform many of our lines of business depend upon the private sector of the us insurance system its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use of and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance plans healthcare reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the industry in which we operate in substantial ways 

the new administration and certain key members of congress have expressed a desire to replace or amend all or a portion of healthcare reform any partial or complete repeal or amendment or implementation difficulties or uncertainty regarding such events could increase our costs of compliance prevent or delay future adoption of our exchange platform and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition given the uncertainty relating to the potential repeal and replacement of healthcare reform the impact is difficult to determine but it could have negative effects on us including 

 any of these effects could materially harm our business and results of operations for example the manner in which the federal government and the states implement health insurance exchanges and the process for receiving subsidies and costsharing credits could substantially increase our competition and member turnover and substantially reduce the number of individuals who purchase insurance through us various aspects of healthcare reform could cause insurance carriers to limit the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell and the geographies in which we are able to sell them in addition the us congress may seek to find spending cuts and such cuts may include medicare if cuts are made to medicare there may be substantial changes in the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell changes in the law could also cause insurance carriers to exit the business of selling insurance plans in a particular jurisdiction to eliminate certain categories of products or to attempt to move members into new plans for which we receive lower commissions if insurance carriers decide to limit our ability to sell their plans or determine not to sell individual health insurance plans altogether our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions and we face risks when we acquire or divest businesses and could have difficulty in acquiring integrating or managing acquired businesses or with effecting internal reorganizations all of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation 

our growth depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions we may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms acceptable or favorable to us we also face additional risks related to acquisitions including that we could overpay for acquired businesses and that any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to our expectations if we are unable to identify and successfully make integrate and manage acquisitions our business could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks related to divesting businesses including that we may not receive adequate consideration in return for the divested business we may continue to be subject to the liabilities of the divested business after its divestiture including with respect to work we might perform on behalf of the divested business and we may not be able to reduce overhead or redeploy assets or retain colleagues after the divestiture closes 

in addition we cannot be certain that our acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or that our acquisitions or divestitures will otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if the 

operating performance of an acquired business deteriorates significantly we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet 

we may be unable to effectively integrate an acquired business into our organization and may not succeed in managing such acquired businesses or the larger company that results from such acquisitions the process of integrating an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks including without limitation an inability to retain the management key personnel and other employees of the acquired business an inability to establish uniform standards controls systems procedures and policies or to achieve anticipated synergies and exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition 

we may also face similar challenges in effecting internal reorganizations if acquisitions or internal reorganizations are not successfully integrated our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as well as our professional reputation we also own an interest in a number of associates where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore limited in our ability to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we could achieve if we had full ownership 

limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 

we cannot guarantee that trade secret trademark and copyright law protections are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property including our software which may become an increasingly important part of our business existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights also we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot be sure that our services and products or the products of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients these claims may harm our reputation result in financial liability consume financial resources to pursue or defend and prevent us from offering some services or products 

financial and tax risks 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility and we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 

willis towers watson had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 45 billion as of december 31 2017 and our interest expense was 188 million for the year ended december 31 2017 

although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may 

 the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments the operating restrictions and financial covenants in our credit facilities do and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that is not cured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations 

with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the maintenance and growth of our business depends on our access to capital which will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on us 

a downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility and under certain circumstances may require us to offer to buy back some of our outstanding debt 

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility in addition certain downgrades would trigger a stepup in interest rates under the indentures for certain of our senior notes which would increase our interest expense if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources 

in addition under the indenture for our 3600 senior notes due 2024 our 4625 senior notes due 2023 our 6125 senior notes due 2043 our 3500 senior notes due 2021 our 4400 senior notes due 2026 and our 2125 senior notes due 2022 if we experience a ratings decline together with a change of control event we would be required to offer to purchase these notes from holders unless we had previously redeemed those notes we may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

legislative or regulatory action in the us or abroad could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from expectations and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the ‘us tax reform’ the us tax reform includes numerous changes to existing tax law including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 although the rate reduction takes effect on january 1 2018 the impact to the company on the remeasurement of its deferred taxes was significant among other things us tax reform could cause us to lose the benefit of certain tax credits and deductions including for performancebased compensation under section 162m limit our ability to deduct interest incurred in the us and potentially increase our income taxes due to the base erosion and antiabuse tax and onetime transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries while we recorded provisional estimates for 2017 we will continue to evaluate the overall impact of us tax reform on our operations and tax position over the next twelve months our expectations of the impact of us tax reform are also subject to change possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretation or assumptions andor updated regulatory guidance the us tax reform could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

further legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely or otherwise affect the taxes that the us imposes on our worldwide operations regulations or administrative guidance from the us treasury department could have similar consequences such changes could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant additional expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that have the effect of limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise experience business detriment 

in addition the us congress the organisation for economic cooperation and development ‘oecd’ world trade organization and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates in october 2015 the oecd released final reports addressing fifteen specific actions as part of a comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting although the timing and methods of implementation vary several jurisdictions have enacted legislation that is aligned with and in some cases exceeds the scope of the oecd’s recommendations ireland is currently conducting hearings on the irish corporate tax system and is considering changes that could be adopted as part of its 2018 budget which could be effective as early as 2019 as a result the tax laws in 

the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various other risks that could impact our business 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside of the us accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or us dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws additionally and as noted above the unknown impacts of brexit may expose us to additional exchange rate fluctuations in the pound sterling 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenues and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenues in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside of the us and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in local currencies 

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses together with any net pound sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollar denominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure while we do utilize hedging strategies to attempt to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective 

changes in accounting principles or in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ‘us gaap’ any change to accounting principles particularly to us gaap could have a material adverse effect on us or our results of operations for example we adopted a new revenue recognition standard as of january 1 2018 changes in our revenues and costs on a year over year basis could occur as a result of such adoption and in any event the standards will impact the presentation of our financial results 

us gaap accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to revenue recognition valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients discretionary compensation incurred but not reported liabilities restructuring pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates and changes in accounting standards could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

in addition we have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed and we significantly increased goodwill as a result of the merger we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

we have material pension liabilities that can fluctuate significantly and adversely affect our financial position or net income or result in other financial impact 

we have material pension liabilities some of which represent unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement liabilities movements in the interest rate environment investment returns inflation or changes in other assumptions that are used to estimate our benefit obligations and other factors could have a material effect on the level of liabilities in these plans at any given time most pension plans have minimum funding requirements that may require material amounts of periodic additional funding and accounting requirements that may result in increased pension expense for example in 2017 we were required to 

recognize a £ 27 million 36 million pension settlement expense related to transfer payments and the accelerated recognition of certain accumulated losses in our uk pension scheme depending on the above factors among others we could be required to recognize further pension expense in the future increased pension expense could adversely affect our earnings or cause earnings volatility in addition the need to make additional cash contributions may reduce our financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or other needs of our business 

our quarterly revenues could fluctuate including as a result of factors outside of our control while our expenses are relatively fixed 

quarterly variations in our revenues and results of operations have occurred in the past and could occur as a result of a number of factors such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter seasonality of certain types of services the number of business days in a quarter colleague hiring and utilization rates our clients’ ability to terminate engagements without penalty the size and scope of assignments and general economic conditions 

we derive significant revenues from commissions for brokerage services but do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in the premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission levels may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin we could be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions in addition insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as us the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

a sizeable portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed encompassing the majority of administrative occupancy communications and other expenses depreciation and amortization and salaries and employee benefits excluding fiscal yearend incentive bonuses therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments or our inability to forecast demand can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results and could result in losses and volatility in our stock price 

the laws of ireland differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders for repurchasing shares of common stock and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain 

cash from these subsidiaries for example willis limited our uk brokerage subsidiary regulated by the fca is currently required to maintain 140 million in unencumbered and available financial resources of which at least 79 million must be in cash for regulatory purposes in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on or repurchase shares of common stock 

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2017  we operated offices in many countries and territories throughout the world and believe that our properties are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used the principal properties are located in the united states and the united kingdom operations of each of our segments are carried out in owned or leased offices under operating leases that typically do not exceed 10 years in length except for certain properties in key locations we do not anticipate difficulty in meeting our space needs at lease expiration

share data 

our shares began trading on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol ‘wltw’ on january 5 2016 the high and low sale prices of our shares as reported by nasdaq are set forth below for the periods indicated 



on february 23 2018  our share price as reported by the nasdaq was 15996 per share as of february 23 2018  there were approximately 1319 shareholders of record of our shares 

dividends 

we normally pay dividends on a quarterly basis to shareholders of record on march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 the dividend payment dates and amounts are as follows

there are no governmental laws decrees or regulations in ireland that restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to nonresident holders of the company’s shares 

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the united states should be exempt from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from irish dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends 

with respect to noncorporate us shareholders certain dividends from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received 

from that corporation on shares that are readily tradeable on an established securities market in the united states such as our shares noncorporate us shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as investment income pursuant to section 163d4 of the code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation in addition the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances

market conditions 

due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin a ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin rates however vary by geography 

industry and client segment as a result and due to the global and diverse nature of our business we view rates in the aggregate   

market conditions in our broking industry are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world insurance rate movements and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients   

management has considered the uk referendum vote on june 23 2016 to depart from the eu the triggering of article 50 of the treaty of lisbon providing the right to and procedures for a member to leave the eu on march 29 2017 the early general election held on june 8 2017 and the uncertainties about the nearterm and longerterm effects of brexit on the company the terms of brexit and its impact are highly uncertain for a further discussion of the risks of brexit to the company see part i item 1a risk factors within this annual report on form 10k   

typically our business benefits from regulatory change political risk or economic uncertainty insurance broking generally tracks the economy but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty we have some businesses such as our health and benefits and administration businesses which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change   

although approximately 22 of our revenues are generated in the uk on an annual basis only about 13 of revenues are denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 19 of our expenses are denominated in pounds sterling thus we generally benefit from a weakening pound sterling in our income from operations however we have a company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency   

the markets for our consulting technology and solutions and marketplace services are subject to changes as a result of economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors we believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs with regard to the market for exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform part of the employer sponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase as these market segments continue to evolve we may experience growth in intervals with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth   

see part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k  for discussions of risks that may affect our ability to compete

impact of us tax reform 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as us tax reform us tax reform makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that may be payable over eight years 2 bonus depreciation that will allow for a full expensing of qualified property 3 reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 4 a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income ‘gilti’ which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ‘ftcs’ and a deduction of up to 50  to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 5 a new limitation on deductible interest expense 6 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 7 limitations on the use of ftcs to reduce the us income tax liability 8 the creation of the base erosion antiabuse tax ‘beat’ a new minimum tax and 9 a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 

also on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 ‘sab 118’ which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the us tax reform sab 118 provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the us tax reform enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under accounting standards codification ‘asc’ 740 income taxes ‘asc 740’ in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of us tax reform for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete adjustments to incomplete and unknown amounts will be recorded and disclosed prospectively during the measurement period to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of us tax reform is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of us tax reform 

at december 31 2017 there are no material elements of us tax reform for which the company’s accounting is complete while the companys accounting for the following elements of us tax reform is incomplete the company was able to make reasonable estimates of certain effects accordingly the company recorded provisional adjustments for the following significant items 

reduction of the federal corporate tax rate – beginning january 1 2018 the company’s us income will be taxed at a 21 federal corporate tax rate under asc 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recalculated as of the enactment date using current tax laws and rates expected to be in effect when the deferred tax items reverse in future periods which is 21 consequently the company has recorded a provisional decrease in its net deferred tax liabilities of 208 million with a corresponding deferred income tax benefit of 208 million while the company is able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate it may be affected by other analyses related to us tax reform that could result in other adjustments to us federal deferred tax balances including analysis of tax amounts in other comprehensive income and any future guidance issued 

onetime transition tax – the onetime transition tax is based on the company’s total post1986 earnings and profits ‘ep’ that it previously deferred from us income taxes the company recorded a provisional amount for the one 

time transition tax liability for its foreign subsidiaries owned by us corporate shareholders resulting in an increase in us federal income tax expense of 70 million and state income tax expense of 2 million the company has a significant number of foreign subsidiaries and therefore has not yet completed its calculation of the total post1986 ep as well as nonus income taxes paid for these foreign subsidiaries further the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets including trade receivables based on estimates the company expects to revise its estimates of ep nonus income taxes and cash balances throughout 2018 when actual results are available in addition guidance may be released which could also impact these estimates 

indefinite reinvestment assertion –  beginning in 2018 us tax reform provides a 100 deduction for dividends received from 10percent owned foreign corporations by us corporate shareholders subject to a oneyear holding period although dividend income is now exempt from us federal tax for us corporate shareholders companies must still account for the tax consequences of outside basis differences and other tax impacts of their investments in nonus subsidiaries as a result of us tax reform we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation and have determined that we may repatriate up to 219 million the majority of which was previously deemed indefinitely reinvested for those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation we have recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes of 1 million in addition we remeasured the existing deferred tax liability accrued on certain acquired towers watson subsidiaries and released the deferred tax liability relating to the outside basis difference this resulted in an income tax benefit of 76 million as these foreign earnings were subject to the onetime transition tax which reduced the outside basis difference 

bonus depreciation – while the company has not completed its determination of all capital expenditures that qualify for immediate expensing for the year ended december 31 2017 the company recorded a provisional tax deduction of 40 million based on its current intent to fully expense all qualifying expenditures the company will analyze the dates all capital expenditures were placed in service or acquired and consider any future guidance within the next twelve months to finalize the deduction this resulted in an increase of approximately 14 million to the companys us federal current income taxes receivable and a corresponding increase in its net deferred tax liabilities of approximately 14 million 

executive compensation –  starting with compensation paid in 2018 section 162m will limit the company from deducting compensation including performancebased compensation in excess of 1 million paid to anyone who starting in 2018 serves as the chief executive officer or chief financial officer or who is among the three most highly compensated executive officers the only exception to this rule is for compensation that is paid pursuant to a binding contract in effect on november 2 2017 that would have otherwise been deductible under the prior section 162m rules accordingly any compensation paid in the future pursuant to new compensation arrangements entered into after november 2 2017 even if performancebased will count towards the 1 million deduction limit if paid to a covered executive the company recorded a provisional income tax expense of 8 million relating to our compensation plans not qualifying for the binding contract exception we are in the process of obtaining additional information needed to complete our analysis of the binding contract requirement on the various compensation plans to determine the full impact of the law change in addition guidance may be released which could also impact our estimates 

the companys accounting for the following law changes of us tax reform is incomplete and it is not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the effects therefore no provisional adjustment was recorded 

gilti – us tax reform creates a new requirement that certain income ie gilti earned by controlled foreign corporations ‘cfcs’ must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholder gilti is the excess of the shareholder’s ‘net cfc tested income’ over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of 1 10 percent of the aggregate of the us shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc with respect to which it is a us shareholder over 2 the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfctested income because of the complexity of the new gilti tax rules the company is continuing to evaluate this provision of us tax reform and the application of asc 740 under us gaap the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the ‘period cost method’ or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the ‘deferred method’ the company’s selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new gilti tax rules will depend in part on analyzing its global income of its cfcs to determine whether it expects to have future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti and if so what the impact is expected to be because whether the company expects to have future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti depends on not only its current structure and estimated future results of global operations but also its intent and ability to modify its structure andor its business the company is not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of us tax reform therefore it has not made any adjustments related to potential gilti tax in its consolidated financial statements and has not made a policy decision 

valuation allowances – the company must assess whether valuation allowances assessments are affected by various aspects of us tax reform eg limitation on net interest expense in excess of 30 of adjusted taxable income as of december 31 2017 no changes to valuation allowances have been recorded as a result of us tax reform 

restructuring programs 

operational improvement program   

in april 2014 legacy willis announced a multiyear operational improvement program designed to strengthen its client service capabilities and deliver future cost savings the main elements of the program which was completed during 2017 included moving more than 3500 support roles from higher cost locations to facilities in lower cost locations net workforce reductions in support positions lease consolidation in real estate and information technology systems simplification and rationalization   

the company is expecting to deliver 325 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018 to achieve these savings it has incurred cumulative restructuring charges of 441 million for the program since it began in the second quarter of 2014

liquidity and capital resources   

executive summary   

our principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities or new debt offerings   

based on our balance sheets combined cash flows current market conditions and information available to us at this time we believe that willis towers watson has sufficient liquidity which includes our undrawn revolving credit facilities to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months including investing in the business for growth creating value through the integration of willis towers watson and gras savoye scheduled debt repayments dividend payments and contemplated share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors   

the company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments beginning in 2016 as a result of our plan to restructure or distribute accumulated earnings of certain acquired towers watson foreign operations we accrued deferred taxes on the historical and current year earnings of those subsidiaries the historical cumulative earnings of our other subsidiaries had been reinvested indefinitely and therefore we had not provided deferred tax liabilities on these amounts as a result of us tax reform we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation for those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation we have recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes in addition we remeasured the existing deferred tax liability accrued on certain acquired towers watson subsidiaries and released the deferred tax liability relating to the outside basis difference if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital longterm investment requirements or additional guidance relating to us tax reform necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for income and foreign withholding taxes net of credits may be necessary other potential sources of cash may be through the settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a taxefficient manner 

events that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results potential future acquisitions or divestitures material changes in geographic sources of cash unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets

additionally at december 31 2017 362 million was available to draw against our 125 billion revolving credit facility as compared to 557 million which was available to draw against our previous 800 million revolving credit facility at december 31 2016

at december 31 2017  our material mandatory debt repayments over the next twelve months consist of scheduled repayments of 85 million on our term loan maturing in 2019   

in march 2017 we entered into a 125 billion revolving credit facility replacing our previous 800 million revolving credit facility borrowings against the 125 billion facility of 409 million  and €45 million  were used to repay all outstanding borrowings against the 800 million facility and the 7year term loan due july 23 2018

  at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all financial covenants   

fiduciary funds   

as an intermediary we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers we report premiums which are held on account of or due from clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers claims held by or due to us which are due to clients are also shown as both fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities on our balance sheets  

fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity such funds are not available to service the company’s debt or for other corporate purposes notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers the company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and in some cases as supported by agreements with insureds   

at december 31 2017  and 2016  we had fiduciary funds of 33 billion and 25 billion respectively   

share repurchase program 

the company is authorized to repurchase shares by way of redemption and will consider whether to do so from time to time based on many factors including market conditions    

on april 20 2016 the willis towers watson board reconfirmed reapproved and reauthorized the remaining portion of the legacy willis program to repurchase the company’s ordinary shares on the open market or by way of redemption or otherwise      

on november 10 2016 the company announced the board of directors approved an increase to the existing share repurchase program of 1 billion the 1 billion increase was in addition to the remaining authority on the legacy willis program discussed in the preceding paragraph  at december 31 2017  approximately 601 million  remained on the current repurchase authority the maximum number of shares that could be repurchased based on the closing price of our ordinary shares on december 31 2017  of 15069  was 3986473  

on february 23 2018 the board of directors approved an increase to the existing share repurchase program of 400 million the 400 million increase is in addition to the remaining authority of 601 million as of december 31 2017

nongaap financial measures 

in order to assist readers of our consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that willis towers watson’s management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes we present the following nongaap measures and their most directly comparable us gaap measure 



the company believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance and in the case of free cash flow our liquidity results 

within the measures referred to as “adjusted” we have adjusted for significant items which will not be settled in cash or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations these items include the following 



 these nongaap measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies nongaap measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for the information contained within our consolidated financial statements   

the pro forma financial information for 2015 is only for willis and towers watson and does not include gras savoye or other ma activity on a pro forma basis   

adjusted revenues   

we consider adjusted revenues to be an important financial measure which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors   

adjusted revenues is defined as total revenues adjusted for the fair value adjustment for deferred revenues that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions us gaap accounting requires the elimination of this revenue   

we have included the reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues in the table below together with our reconciliation of the pro forma revenues change to the constant currency and organic changes   

constant currency change and organic change   

we evaluate our revenues on an as reported us gaap constant currency and organic basis we believe providing constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally   

 the constant currency and organic change results and a reconciliation from the reported results for consolidated revenues are included in the consolidated revenues section within this form 10k these measures are also reported by segment in the ‘as reported segment revenues’ and ‘supplementary pro forma segment revenues’ sections within this form 10k

 adjusted income before taxes and adjusted income taxestax rate   

adjusted income before taxes is defined as income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates adjusted for amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses significant litigation settlements significant pension settlement and curtailment activity the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue gainloss on disposal of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate   

adjusted income taxestax rate is defined as the provision forbenefit from income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses significant litigation settlements significant pension 

settlement and curtailment activity the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue lossgain on disposal of operations tax effects of internal reorganizations and us tax reform and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results divided by adjusted income before taxes adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate    

management believes the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate we would incur if not for the reduction of pretax income for the adjusted items the tax effects of our internal reorganizations and the tax effect of us tax reform which are not core to our current and future operations   

reconciliations of income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates to adjusted income before taxes and provision forbenefit from income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the years ended   december 31 2017  and 2016 are as follows 



   

i the tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item   

ii we have not presented this measure on a comparative basis with 2015 because it is not practical to present the 2015 adjusted income tax rate on a pro forma basis as making taxeffected nongaap adjustments on a proforma basis would be highly speculative in nature   

our adjusted income tax rates were 219  and 208  for the years ended   december 31 2017  and 2016 respectively the lower adjusted tax rate for the year ended   december 31 2016  was primarily due to a prior year tax benefit resulting from an enacted statutory tax rate reduction in the uk 

free cash flow   

free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use and is used to evaluate our liquidity   

reconciliations of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 are as follows   



 

 the decrease in free cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily resulted from higher capital expenditures and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle these discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to legacy towers watson colleagues due to the timing of the merger   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

these consolidated financial statements conform to us gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period our estimates judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates the areas that we believe are critical accounting policies include valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients discretionary compensation income taxes commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities pension assumptions and goodwill and intangible assets the critical accounting policies discussed below involve making difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations these critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption different estimates that we could have used or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the clients’ failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered including allowances when client disputes may exist the related provision is recorded as a reduction to revenue our allowance policy is based on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on the writeoff history facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due general market conditions current economic trends and our clients’ ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables 

discretionary compensation 

our compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash andor deferred stock units after our annual operating results are finalized 

an estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted if necessary by management to reflect changes in the forecast of prebonus profitability for the year 

income taxes 

the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the change is enacted deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as based on available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company adjusts valuation allowances 

to measure deferred tax assets at the amount considered realizable in future periods if the company’s facts and assumptions change in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and the results of recent financial operations we place more reliance on evidence that is objectively verifiable 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance and consulting services in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice in certain cases where a range of loss exists we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount 

see note 13  — commitments and contingencies  in item 8 within this annual report on form 10k 

pension assumptions 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in several countries with the most significant defined benefit plans offered in the us and uk our disclosures in note 12  — retirement benefits  contain additional information about our other less significant but material retirement plans within our critical accounting policy discussion we have excluded analysis for plans outside of those noted in the description below as any variance of recorded information based on management’s estimates would be immaterial 

descriptions of our us and uk plans which comprise 91 of our projected benefit obligations and 93 of our plan assets are below 

united states 

legacy willis  – this plan was frozen in 2009 approximately onequarter of the legacy willis employees in the united states have a frozen accrued benefit under this plan 

willis towers watson plan   – substantially all us employees are eligible to participate in this plan benefits are provided under a stable value pension plan design the original stable value design came into effect on january 1 2012 as of july 1 2017 existing plan participants earn benefits without having to make employee contributions and all newly eligible employees are required to contribute 2 of pay to participate in the plan 

united kingdom 

legacy willis  – this plan covers approximately one third of the legacy willis employees in the united kingdom the plan is now closed to new entrants new employees in the united kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan 

legacy towers watson  – benefit accruals earned under the legacy watson wyatt defined benefit plan predominantly pension benefits ceased on february 28 2015 although benefits earned prior to january 1 2008 retain a link to salary until the employee leaves the company benefit accruals earned under the legacy towers perrin defined benefit plan predominantly lump sum benefits were frozen on march 31 2008 all participants now accrue defined contribution benefits 

legacy miller  – the plan provides retirement benefits based on members’ salaries at the point at which they ceased to accrue benefits under the scheme 

the determination of the company’s obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that given the longevity of the plans are longterm in focus a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation however certain of these changes such as changes in the discount rates and other actuarial assumptions are not recognized immediately in net income but are instead recorded in other comprehensive income the accumulated gains and losses not yet recognized in net income are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit costcredit based on the average working life expectancy of each of the plan’s active participants to the extent that the net gains or losses as of the beginning of the year exceed 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation 

willis towers watson considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions including economic forecasts relevant benchmarks historical trends portfolio composition and peer company comparisons these assumptions used to determine our pension liabilities and pension expense are reviewed annually by senior 

management and changed when appropriate a discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised to calculate the discount rate we use the granular approach to determining service cost and interest cost we began using this method to calculate the discount rate in 2016 this was treated as a change in accounting estimate and resulted in a credit of 51 million included in our total net periodic benefit income the expected rate of return assumptions for all plans are supported by an analysis of the weightedaverage yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality and the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases 

funding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes or as agreed to with the plan trustees for the uk plans since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes pension contributions are not equal to net periodic benefit cost 

we recorded a combined 113 million net periodic benefit income for our us and uk plans for the year ended december 31 2017 for the us and uk plans the following table presents our estimated net periodic benefit income for 2018 and the impact to both plans of a 025 increase and decrease to both the expected return on assets ‘eroa’ and the discount rate assumptions and the projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2017 and the impact of a 025 increase and decrease to the discount rates 



economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

goodwill and intangible assets — impairment review 

in applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with the remainder recorded as goodwill intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise the fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise 

goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and the company had nine reporting units as of october 1 2017 

during fiscal year 2017  the company performed step 1 of the twostep impairment test for all reporting units each of the reporting units estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values to perform the test we used valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit that fall under income or market approaches under the discounted cash flow method an income approach the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debtfree aftertax cash flows for a finite period of years key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management business risk and expected rates of return on capital the guideline company method a market approach develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies key estimates and selection of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies obtaining estimates of forecast revenues and ebitda estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics under the similar transactions method a market approach actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units is used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units 

if the company was required to perform step 2 we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit used in step 1 to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination then the implied fair value of goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if goodwill is impaired for the year ended december 31 2017  we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill or intangibles 

recent accounting pronouncements 

while we are still in the process of analyzing the various accounting standards updates ‘asu’ issued by the financial accounting standards board ‘fasb’ those which we believe will have a material impact to our financial statements are listed below see note 2  — basis of presentation significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements  within item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management   

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes   

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2  — basis of presentation significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements  and note 9  — derivative financial instruments  within item 8 of this form 10k   

foreign exchange risk   

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results   

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenues and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the united states we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earn revenues in several currencies but incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling   

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2017  



   

 our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from   

 london market operations   

the company’s primary foreign exchange risks in its london market operations arise from changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and pound sterling as its london market operations earn the majority of its revenues in us dollars but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling and may also hold a significant net sterling asset or liability position on the balance sheet in addition the london market operations earn significant revenues in euro and japanese yen   

the foreign exchange risks in our london market operations are hedged to the extent that   

 translation risk   

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in 

exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower   

with the exception of foreign currency hedges for certain intercompany loans that are not designated as hedging instruments we do not hedge translation risk   

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within three years 



   

 income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the united kingdom is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities   

interest rate risk   

the company has access to i 125 billion under a revolving credit facility expiring march 7 2022 and ii 20 million available under another revolving credit facility which is only available for specific regulatory purposes as of december 31 2017  884 million was drawn on these facilities we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in both us dollars and pounds sterling   

as a result of our operating activities we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies we earn interest on these funds which is included in our consolidated financial statements as interest income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity   

the table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for interest rate swaps the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts the duration of the interest rate swaps was three years with refixing periods of three months average fixed and variable rates are respectively the weightedaverage actual and market rates for the interest rate hedges in place market rates are the rates prevailing at december 31 2017  we have evaluated the need for a sensitivity analysis and based on the companys debt we believe this to be immaterial   



     

 credit risk and concentrations of credit risk   

credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted the company currently does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties the company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk   

concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents fiduciary funds accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value   

the company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure these financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies

competition 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with accenture plc aon plc arthur j gallagher  co brown  brown inc cognizant technology solutions corporation marsh  mclennan companies inc and robert half international inc as well as with numerous specialty regional and local firms marsh  mclennan companies and aon plc are the two other major providers of global risk management services competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and in some business lines marsh  mclennan companies and aon plc have greater market share than we do 

competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their 

own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services   

the human capital and risk management consulting industries are highly competitive we believe there are significant barriers to entry and we have developed competitive advantages in providing hr consulting and risk management consulting services we face strong competition from several sources   

our principal competitors in the pension consulting industry are mercer hr consulting a marsh  mclennan company and aon plc beyond these large players the global hr consulting industry is highly fragmented   

our major competitors in the insurance consulting and software industry include milliman oliver wyman a marsh  mclennan company the big four accounting firms and sungard aon buck consultants a xerox company connextions a united healthcare company mercer a marsh  mclennan company automatic data processing and fidelity are our primary competitors in the insurance exchange industry with the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act we also compete with the public exchanges currently run by the us federal and state governments we now compete with providers of accountbased health plans and consumerdirected benefits such as wageworks and healthequity   

the market for our services is subject to change as a result of economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors regulatory and legislative actions along with continuously evolving technological developments will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products we believe the primary factors in selecting an hr consulting or risk management services firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs with regard to the market for exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients a strong reputation for efficient execution a provider’s capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments and financing options and an innovative service delivery model and platform for our traditional consulting and risk management services and the rapidly evolving exchange products we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors   

regulation 

our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasigovernmental regulatory supervision in all countries in which we operate also such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities while these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria we are also subject to data privacy regulations in many countries our most significant regulatory regions are described below

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements these risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business the descriptions below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown to us could also impair our business operations financial condition or results if any of the risks and uncertainties below or other risks were to occur our business operations financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted with respect to the taxrelated consequences of acquisition ownership and disposal of ordinary shares you should consult with your own tax advisors     

risks relating to integration following the merger and related actions   

we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger or related actions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the businesses   

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger and related actions occurring around the time of the merger particularly the gras savoye acquisition depends to a large extent on our ability to integrate the businesses the combination of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we have been and will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integration activities the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively could restrict the realization of the fullexpected benefits the failure to meet the 

challenges involved in integrating the businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations   

in addition the overall integration may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of client relationships and diversion of management’s attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others   

 many of these factors have been and will continue to be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if our operations are integrated successfully the full benefits of the transactions may not be realized including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integrations all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected benefits of the merger or the related actions including the gras savoye acquisition and negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares as a result we cannot assure you that the merger or the gras savoye acquisition will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated   

the loss of key colleagues as a result of the merger or otherwise could damage or result in the loss of client relationships and could result in such colleagues competing against us   

our success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including key managers and colleagues in addition our success largely depends upon our colleagues’ abilities to generate business and provide quality services in particular our colleagues’ business relationships with our clients are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements the uncertainties about the effect of the merger and the related actions may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel following the merger we have lost colleagues who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise if we lose additional colleagues such as those or if we are unable to successfully attract new talent it could materially adversely affect our ability to secure and complete engagements which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects in addition we have experienced intense competition for certain types of colleagues in the past including following the merger and if any of our key colleagues were to join a competitor or form a competing company or we are unable to continue to recruit key colleagues existing and potential clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of willis towers watson’s services    

we have incurred and will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the merger and related actions which could exceed our estimates   

we have incurred substantial expenses in connection with completing the merger and related actions including the gras savoye acquisition and expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with coordinating and integrating the businesses operations policies and procedures of the combined companies while we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses will be incurred there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these transaction and integration expenses many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to 

estimate accurately these expenses may exceed the costs historically borne by us which could exceed our estimates for these expenses these costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations   

our success largely depends on our ability to achieve our global business strategy arising out of the merger and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer if the company were unable to successfully establish and execute on its strategy and generate anticipated revenue growth and cost savings and efficiencies   

our future growth profitability and cash flows largely depend upon our ability to successfully establish and execute our global business strategy as discussed under “business  business strategy” we seek to be an advisory broking and solutions provider of choice through an integrated global platform created as a result of the merger although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of our business strategy while we have confidence that our strategic plan reflects opportunities that are appropriate and achievable there is a possibility that our strategy may not deliver the projected results due to inadequate execution incorrect assumptions global or local economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we operate suboptimal resource allocation or any of the other risks described in this risk factors section the failure to execute optimally on our global business strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   

risks relating to our business   

demand for our services could decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn increased competition a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or prospects or a decline in defined benefit pension plans or the purchasing of insurance all of which could materially adversely affect us   

we can give no assurance that the demand for our services will grow or that we will compete successfully with our existing competitors new competitors or our clients’ internal capabilities client demand for our services may change based on the clients’ needs and financial conditions   

our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve global financial markets may continue to experience disruptions including increased volatility and credit availability which could substantially impact our results economic slowdowns in some markets have caused and may continue to cause reductions in discretionary spending by our clients longer client payment terms an increase in late payments by clients and an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable each of which may reduce the demand for our services increase price competition andor adversely impact our growth profit margins and liquidity   

while it is difficult to predict the consequences of any deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing our services or insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the potential for a significant insurer to fail be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients   

in addition the markets for our principal services are highly competitive our competitors include other insurance brokerage human capital and risk management consulting and actuarial firms and the human capital and risk management divisions of diversified professional services insurance brokerage and accounting firms and specialty regional and local firms   

competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and some competitors have greater market share in certain lines of business than we do some of our competitors have greater financial technical and marketing resources than us which could enhance their ability to finance acquisitions fund internal growth and respond more quickly to professional and technological changes new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge creating additional competition and gaining significant market share resulting in a loss of business for us and a corresponding decline in revenues and profit margin in order to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure we may have to lower our prices which would also have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin   

an example of a business that may be significantly impacted by changes in customer demand is our retirement consulting and actuarial business which comprises a substantial portion of our revenue and profit we provide clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans defined benefit pension plans generally require more actuarial services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools complex calculations to determine employer costs funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we 

anticipate or if we are unable to otherwise compensate for the decline in our business that results from employers moving away from defined benefit plans our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected   

in addition the demand for many of our core benefit services including compliancerelated services is affected by government regulation and taxation of employee benefit plans significant changes in tax or social welfare policy or other regulations could lead some employers to discontinue their employee benefit plans including defined benefit pension plans thereby reducing the demand for our services a simplification of regulations or tax policy also could reduce the need for our services   

we could be subject to claims and lawsuits arising from our work as well as government inquiries and investigations which could materially adversely affect our reputation business and financial condition   

we depend in large part on our relationships with clients and our reputation for highquality services to secure future engagements clients that become dissatisfied with our services may terminate their business relationships with us and clients and third parties that claim they suffered damages caused by our services may bring lawsuits against us we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the provision of our services or the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims see note 13  — commitments and contingencies  in item 8 in this annual report on form 10k for examples of claims to which we are subject including claims arising out of the stanford insolvency   

because we often assist our clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money including actuarial services and the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may arise that allege our potential liability for all or part of the substantial amounts in question the nature of our work particularly our actuarial services necessarily involves the use of assumptions and the preparation of estimates relating to future and contingent events the actual outcome of which we cannot know in advance our actuarial and brokerage services also rely on substantial amounts of data provided by clients the accuracy and quality of which we cannot ensure in addition we could make computational software programming or data management errors in connection with the services we provide to clients   

clients may seek to hold us responsible for alleged errors or omissions related to any of the brokerage advice and services we provide including when claims they submit to their insurance carriers are disputed or denied given that many of our clients have very high insurance policy limits to cover all of their risks alleged errors and omissions claims against us arising from disputed or denied claims are often significant moreover in a number of markets and in various circumstances our brokerage and certain other terms of business may not limit the maximum liability to which we may be exposed for claims involving alleged errors or omissions and as such we do not have limited liability for the work we provide to the associated clients   

further given that we frequently work with large pension funds and insurance companies as well as other large clients relatively small percentage errors or variances can create significant financial variances and result in significant claims for unintended or unfunded liabilities the risks from such variances or errors could be aggravated in an environment of declining pension fund asset values and insurance company capital levels in almost all cases our exposure to liability with respect to a particular engagement is substantially greater than the revenue opportunity that the engagement generates for us   

clients may seek to hold us responsible for the financial consequences of variances between assumptions and estimates and actual outcomes or for errors for example in the case of liability for pension plan actuarial errors a client’s claims might focus on the client’s alleged reliance that actuarial assumptions were reasonable and based on such reliance the client made benefit commitments the client may later claim are not affordable or funding decisions that result in plan underfunding if and when actual outcomes vary from actuarial assumptions   

we also provide advice on both asset allocation and selection of investment managers increasingly for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on both of these matters or we may serve in a fiduciary capacity either of which may increase liability exposure in addition for certain clients we are responsible for some portions of cash and investment management including rebalancing of investment portfolios and guidance to third parties on the structure of derivatives and securities transactions asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and investment managers may underperform their benchmarks in both cases the investment return shortfall can be significant clients experiencing this underperformance may assert claims against us and such claims may be for significant amounts in addition our failure to properly execute our role can cause monetary damage to our clients or such third parties for which we might be found liable and such claims may be for significant amounts defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs our ability to limit our potential liability may be limited in certain jurisdictions or in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary duties or other alleged errors or omissions    

the ultimate outcome of all of the above matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period 

could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may also be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the industries we operate in or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships   

finally we have been and may continue to be subject to inquiries and investigations by federal state or other governmental agencies regarding aspects of our clients’ businesses or our own businesses especially regulated businesses such as our insurance broker securities brokerdealer and investment advisory services such inquiries or investigations may consume significant management time and result in regulatory sanctions fines or other actions as well as significant legal fees which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and liquidity   

our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational changes could impact our business results   

we have recently undergone several significant business and organizational changes including the merger the acquisitions of gras savoye and miller insurance services llp and our ongoing business restructuring program and multiyear operational improvement program in connection with these changes we are managing a number of largescale and complex integration projects while we have concluded that each of these large complex projects is necessary or desirable to the execution of the company’s business strategy we cannot guarantee that the collective effect of all of these projects will not adversely impact our business or results of operations in addition as we have experienced competition to retain or recruit talent is heightened in a challenging rate environment or during a time when we are experiencing significant change effectively managing these organizational changes is critical to retaining talent servicing clients and our business success overall the failure to effectively manage such risks could adversely impact our resources or business or financial results   

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal cultural market nationalization operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries   

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets the possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses these risks include   

 our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government regulations or if government regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs   

a material portion of our revenues are affected by statutory or regulatory changes the recent us election may result in significant regulatory change andor uncertainty for example the new administration   and certain key members of congress have expressed a desire to replace or amend all or a portion of the patient protection and affordable care act ‘ppaca’ and 

the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 ‘hcera’ which we refer to collectively as ‘healthcare reform’ if we are unable to adapt our services to applicable laws and regulations our ability to provide effective services in these areas may be substantially impacted   

many areas in which we provide services are the subject of government regulation which is constantly evolving for example our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services are subject to regulation and supervision by national state or other authorities insurance laws in the markets in which we operate are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the markets in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these locations   

changes in government and accounting regulations in the us and the uk two of our principal geographic markets affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human capital programs may materially adversely affect the demand for or the profitability of our services in addition more restrictive rules or interpretations of the federal centers for medicare services marketing rules or judicial decisions that restrict or otherwise change existing provisions of us healthcare regulation could have a material adverse impact on our exchange solutions business further changes to insurance regulatory schemes or our failure to keep pace with such changes could negatively affect demand for services in our investment risk and reinsurance business segment for example our continuing ability to provide investment advisory services depends on compliance with the rules and regulations in each of these jurisdictions any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to disciplinary action including compensating clients for loss the imposition of fines or the revocation of the authorization to operate as well as damage to our reputation   

in addition we have significant operations throughout the world which further subject us to applicable laws and regulations of countries outside the us and the uk changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators in particular countries including changes in administration and enforcement policies could require operational improvements or modifications which may result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business in those countries   

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions and we face risks when we acquire or divest businesses and could have difficulty in acquiring integrating or managing acquired businesses or with effecting internal reorganizations which could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation   

our growth depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions we may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms acceptable or favorable to us we also face additional risks related to acquisitions including that we could overpay for acquired businesses and that any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to our expectations if we are unable to identify and successfully make acquisitions our business could be materially adversely affected   

in addition we cannot be certain that our acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or that our acquisitions or divestitures will otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if the operating performance of an acquired business deteriorates significantly we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet   

we may be unable to effectively integrate an acquired business into our organization and may not succeed in managing such acquired businesses or the larger company that results from such acquisitions the process of integration of an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks including   



 we may also face similar challenges in effecting internal reorganizations if acquisitions or internal reorganizations are not successfully integrated our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as well as our professional reputation   

we also own an interest in a number of associates where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore limited in our ability to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we could achieve if we had full ownership   

data security breaches or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability   

we depend on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients additionally one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their customers andor employees our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and vendors are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks computer viruses hackers and other external hazards as well as improper or inadvertent staff behavior could expose confidential company and personal data systems and information to security breaches   

with respect to our commercial arrangements with thirdparty vendors we have processes designed to require thirdparty it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyberattack on a vendor’s information systems   

unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our information technology networks and systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our colleagues thirdparty service providers or vendors the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving continue to become more advanced and complex and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for example the cyber division of the us federal bureau of investigation ‘fbi’ recently issued a notification that cyber criminals have targeted and may increasingly target assets held in health savings accounts and reimbursement accounts to fraudulently acquire the assets held in those accounts assets held in health savings accounts are expected to grow substantially over the next few years and given the company’s move toward managing more of these assets ourselves as a nonbank custodian in connection with our exchange solutions businesses our reputation could be harmed and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are the target of such fraud and it goes undetected for any period of time   

we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against fraud or unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss however the everevolving threats mean we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all fraud data security breaches or misuses of data any future significant compromise or breach of our data security or fraud whether external or internal or misuse of client colleague supplier or company data could result in additional significant costs lost revenue opportunities fines lawsuits and damage to our reputation   

we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information laws and regulations in this area are evolving and generally becoming more stringent further a uk exit from the eu will increase uncertainty regarding applicable laws and regulations pending more clarity on the terms of that exit if any person including any of our colleagues fails to comply with disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines or criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through systems failure accident employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our colleagues or third parties could result in significant additional expenses including expenses relating to notification of data security breaches and costs of credit monitoring services negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation as well as require substantial resources and effort of management thereby diverting management’s focus and resources from business operations   

we have experienced a number of data incidents resulting from human error or malfeasance as well as attempts at unauthorized access to our systems none of which to our knowledge have been material to our business or our clients we 

maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of data security breaches improper access to or disclosure of confidential company or personally identifiable information our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we hold and protect it from theft computer viruses hackers or inadvertent loss in such circumstances we may be held liable to our clients which could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue further data privacy information security identity theft and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing customer expectations and legal or regulatory requirements in this area including changing legal or regulatory requirements that may be developed or revised due to the vote in the uk to leave the eu could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation or business   

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we comply with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business   

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the us the uk the eu and its member states and the other jurisdictions around the world in which we operate in addition we own an interest in a number of associates where we do not exercise management control over the last few years regulators across the world are increasingly seeking to regulate brokers who operate in their jurisdictions the foreign and us laws and regulations applicable to our operations are complex continually evolving and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings these laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations competition law regulations economic and trade sanctions laws relating to countries in which certain subsidiaries do business or may do business “sanctioned jurisdictions” such as cuba iran russia sudan and syria anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act 2010 and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us as well as laws and regulations related to data privacy and cyber security because of changes in regulation and company practice our nonus subsidiaries are providing more services with connections to various countries including some sanctioned jurisdictions that our us subsidiaries are unable to perform     

in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies monetary fines injunctions revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients while we believe that we have substantially increased our focus on the geographic breadth of regulations to which we are subject maintain good relationships with our key regulators and our current systems and controls are adequate we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of any applicable laws and regulations while we strive to remain fullycompliant with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot guarantee that we will fully comply at all times with all laws and regulations especially in countries with developing or evolving legal systems or with evolving or extraterritorial regulations in particular given the challenges of integrating operations many of which are decentralized we cannot assure that our newlyacquired entities’ business systems and controls have prevented or will prevent any and all violations of applicable laws or regulations   

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing hardware or systems could cause material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability   

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards and to be at the forefront of a range of technology relevant to our business   

if the data we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer hardware applications or software systems or if we experience other disruptions this could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability   

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability   

should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breach power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success 

will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations   

a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability   

damage to our reputation including due to failure of thirdparties on whom we rely to perform services could damage our businesses   

maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with clients and colleagues damage to our reputation could therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory action failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures and unethical behavior negative publicity whether or not true may also result in harm to our prospects in addition the failure to deliver satisfactory service and quality in one line of business could cause clients to terminate the services we provide to that client in many other lines of business   

we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest identifying conflicts of interest may prove particularly difficult in the nearterm while we bring together and integrate legacy willis legacy towers watson and gras savoye in addition we may encounter more conflicts of interest than anticipated in connection with the merger or the gras savoye acquisition and we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest   

the failure or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us   

in addition as part of providing services to clients and managing our business we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers our ability to perform effectively depends in part on the ability of these service providers to meet their obligations as well as on our effective oversight of their performance the quality of our services could suffer or we could be required to incur unanticipated costs if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as expected or their services are disrupted this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation as well as our business and results of operations   

the vote in the united kingdom to leave the european union and the risk that other countries may follow could adversely affect us   

on an annual basis approximately 23 of our revenues are generated in the uk although only about 14 of revenues are denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 20 of our expenses are denominated in pounds sterling in a referendum held in june 2016 a majority of voters in the uk voted in favor of the uk leaving the eu at this time we are not able to predict the impact that the result of this vote will have on the economy economic regulatory and political stability and market conditions in europe including in the uk or on pound sterling euro or other european currencies but any such impacts and others we cannot currently anticipate could materially adversely affect us and our operations among other things we could experience lower growth in the region due to indecision as businesses hold off on generating new projects or due to adverse market conditions and reduced reported revenues and earnings because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars due to the fact that we translate revenue denominated in nonus currencies such as pounds sterling into us dollars for our financial statements in addition there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective   

it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uks future relationship with the eu this year although it is unknown and we cannot anticipate what those terms will be they may result in greater restrictions on business between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities there is also uncertainty regarding how the uks access to the eu single market and the wider trading legal regulatory tax and labor environments especially in the uk and eu will be impacted including the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients any such changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results for example any changes to the passporting or other regulations relating to doing business in various eu countries by relying on a regulatory permission in the uk or doing business in the uk by relying on a regulatory permission in an eu country could increase our costs of doing business or our ability to do so as another example changes in labor laws may impact the ability to hire and retain nonuk staff in the uk or uk staff in the eu in addition the outcome of the referendum has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the uk among other things it is unclear whether the uk will enact legislation similar to the pending european general 

data protection regulation after the uk’s exit from the eu ‘brexit’ and how data transfers to and from the uk will be regulated a change in such regulations or other regulations could increase our costs of doing business or in some cases our ability to do business and adversely impact our operations and financial results   

there is also a risk that other countries may decide to leave the eu in particular depending on the outcome of the upcoming election in france france could be the next country to decide whether to leave the eu we cannot predict the impact that any additional countries leaving the eu will have on us but any such impacts could materially adversely affect us   

our exchange solutions business may be harmed if we lose our relationships with insurance carriers fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers become dependent upon a limited number of insurance carriers or fail to develop new carrier relationships   

our exchange solutions business typically enters into contractual agency relationships with insurance carriers that are nonexclusive and terminable on short notice by either party for any reason in many cases insurance carriers also have the ability to amend the terms of our agreements unilaterally on short notice insurance carriers may be unwilling to allow us to sell their existing or new health insurance plans or may amend our agreements with them for a variety of reasons including for competitive or regulatory reasons or because of a reluctance to distribute their products through our exchange platform insurance carriers may decide to rely on their own internal distribution channels choose to exclude us from their most profitable or popular plans or decide not to distribute insurance plans in individual markets in certain geographies or altogether additionally if one of the insurance carriers with which we are associated violates the law or comes under scrutiny by the centers for medicare  medicaid services ‘cms’ cms may impose sanctions on such carriers resulting in a loss of supply of insurance plans that we are able to sell the termination or amendment of our relationship with an insurance carrier could reduce the variety of health insurance plans we offer we also could lose a source of or be paid reduced commissions for future sales and could lose renewal commissions for past sales our business could also be harmed if we fail to develop new carrier relationships or are unable to offer customers a wide variety of health insurance plans   

the private health insurance industry in the us has experienced a substantial amount of consolidation over the past several years resulting in a decrease in the number of insurance carriers in the future it may become necessary for us to offer insurance plans from a reduced number of insurance carriers or to derive a greater portion of our revenues from a more concentrated number of carriers as our business and the health insurance industry evolve should our dependence on a smaller number of insurance carriers increase whether as a result of the termination of carrier relationships further insurance carrier consolidation or otherwise we may become more vulnerable to adverse changes in our relationships with our carriers particularly in states where we offer health insurance plans from a relatively small number of carriers or where a small number of insurance carriers dominate the market the termination amendment or consolidation of our relationship with our insurance carriers could harm our business results of operations and financial condition   

changes and developments in the health insurance system in the united states could harm our exchange solutions business or other businesses   

in 2010 the federal government enacted significant reforms to healthcare legislation through healthcare reform our exchange solutions business depends upon the private sector of the us insurance system its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use of and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance plans healthcare reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the industry in which we operate in substantial ways   

the recent us election may result in significant regulatory change andor uncertainty the new administration and certain key members of congress have expressed a desire to replace or amend all or a portion of healthcare reform any partial or complete repeal or amendment or implementation difficulties or uncertainty regarding such events could increase our costs of compliance prevent or delay future adoption of our exchange platform and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition given the uncertainty relating to the potential repeal and replacement of healthcare reform the impact is difficult to determine but it could have negative effects on us including   



 any of these effects could materially harm our business and results of operations for example the manner in which the federal government and the states implement health insurance exchanges and the process for receiving subsidies and costsharing credits could substantially increase our competition and member turnover and substantially reduce the number of individuals who purchase insurance through us various aspects of healthcare reform could cause insurance carriers to limit the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell and the geographies in which we are able to sell them in addition the us congress has been charged with finding spending cuts and such cuts are expected to include medicare if cuts are made to medicare there may be substantial changes in the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell changes in the law could also cause insurance carriers to exit the business of selling insurance plans in a particular jurisdiction to eliminate certain categories of products or to attempt to move members into new plans for which we receive lower commissions if insurance carriers decide to limit our ability to sell their plans or determine not to sell individual health insurance plans altogether our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed   

our exchange solutions business may not grow as quickly as expected or its growth may occur faster than expected and we may not have the resources required to support it   

if clients do not select private healthcare exchanges do not select our healthcare exchange business or if clients move to exchanges more slowly than we have anticipated then our exchange solutions business and operating results may be materially adversely affected if conversely revenues from our exchange solutions business do grow significantly there is the risk that we do not have the resources required to support such growth in revenues   

our quarterly revenues could fluctuate including as a result of factors outside of our control while our expenses are relatively fixed   

quarterly variations in our revenues and results of operations have occurred in the past and could occur as a result of a number of factors such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter seasonality of certain types of services the number of business days in a quarter colleague hiring and utilization rates our clients’ ability to terminate engagements without penalty the size and scope of assignments and general economic conditions   

a sizeable portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed encompassing the majority of administrative occupancy communications and other expenses depreciation and amortization and salaries and employee benefits excluding fiscal yearend incentive bonuses therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments or our inability to forecast demand can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results and could result in losses and volatility in our stock price   

we derive significant revenues from commissions for brokerage services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in the premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission levels may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin we have been and continue to be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions in addition insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as ourselves the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability    

accepting market derived income mdi may cause regulatory or other scrutiny which may have a material adverse effect on our business   

insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by commission or fees paid by clients intermediaries also obtain revenue from insurance carriers this is commonly known as market derived income or ‘mdi’ mdi takes a variety of forms including volume or profitbased contingent commissions facilities administration charges business development agreements and fees for providing certain data to carriers   

mdi creates various risks intermediaries have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ interests ahead of their clients accordingly mdi may be subject to scrutiny by 

various regulators under conflict of interest antitrust unfair competition and antibribery laws and regulations while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice and while we have established systems and controls to manage these risks we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny   

new product or service offerings may carry greater risk of liability and regulatory action than existing or historical product or service offerings or may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment   

we continue to grow the business of providing products and services to institutional investors financial services companies and other clients the risk of claims from these lines of business and related products and services may be greater than from our core businesses and such claims may be for significant amounts in addition with respect to some of these new ventures we may enter into arrangements that need to be examined to determine whether they fall under the variable interest entity accounting guidance the structure of such arrangements could require us to consolidate assets or liabilities on which we do not have risk of loss   

we may also invest significant time and resources into new product or service offerings and there is the possibility that these offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business   

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology and analytics to drive value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology analytics and related tools   

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology and analytic solutions that anticipate lead or keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely and costeffective manner and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies or analytic techniques in our business requires us to incur significant cost our competitors are seeking to develop competing technologies and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions if we cannot offer new technologies or analytic services or solutions as quickly or effectively as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or analytic tools it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements   

limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others   

we cannot guarantee that trade secret trademark and copyright law protections are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property including our software which may become an increasingly important part of our business existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights also we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot be sure that our services and products or the products of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients these claims may harm our reputation result in financial liability consume financial resources to pursue or defend and prevent us from offering some services or products   

financial and tax risks   

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility and we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all   

willis towers watson had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 39 billion as of december 31 2016 and our interest expense was 184 million for the year ended december 31 2016   

although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may   



 the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments the operating restrictions and financial covenants in our credit facilities do and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities   

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that is not cured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations   

the maintenance and growth of our business depends on our access to capital which will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on us   

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various other risks that could impact our business   

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside of the us accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or us dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws   

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenues and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenues in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside of the us and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in local currencies   

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses together with any net pound sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollar denominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure   

a downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility and under certain circumstances may require us to offer to buy back some of our outstanding debt   

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility in addition certain downgrades would trigger a stepup in interest rates under the indentures for certain of our senior notes which would increase our interest expense if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources   

in addition under the indenture for our 4625 senior notes due 2023 our 6125 senior notes due 2043 our 3500 senior notes due 2021 our 4400 senior notes due 2026 and our 2125 senior notes due 2022 if we experience a ratings decline together with a change of control event we would be required to offer to purchase these notes from holders unless we had previously redeemed those notes we may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event   

we have material pension liabilities that can fluctuate significantly   

we have material pension liabilities some of which represent unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement liabilities movements in the interest rate environment inflation or changes in other assumptions that are used for the estimates of our benefit obligations and other factors could have a material effect on the level of liabilities in these plans at any given time these pension plans have minimum funding requirements that may require material amounts of periodic additional funding the need to make additional cash contributions may reduce our financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or other needs of our business   

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries   

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders for repurchasing shares of common stock and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries for example willis limited our uk brokerage subsidiary regulated by the fca is currently required to maintain 140 million in unencumbered and available funds of which at least 79 million must be in cash for regulatory purposes in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on or repurchase shares of common stock   

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate   

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations    

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ‘us gaap’ these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to revenue recognition valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients discretionary compensation incurred but not reported liabilities restructuring pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates and changes in accounting standards could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations   

in addition we have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed and we significantly increased goodwill as a result of the merger we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings   

legislative or regulatory action in the us or abroad could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate   

we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from expectations and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate   

legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely or otherwise affect the taxes that the us imposes on our worldwide operations regulations or administrative guidance from the us treasury department could have similar consequences such changes could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant additional expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that 

have the effect of limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise incur business detriment   

in addition the us congress the organisation for economic cooperation and development and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates in october 2015 the organisation for economic cooperation and development released final reports addressing fifteen specific actions as part of a comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates   

the laws of ireland differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities   

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland   

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states

on february 24 2017  our share price as reported by the nasdaq was 12809 per share as of february 24 2017  there were approximately 1415 shareholders of record of our shares 

dividends 

we normally pay dividends on a quarterly basis to shareholders of record on march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 the dividend paid on december 2 2015 was to shareholders of record on november 18 2015 the dividend payment dates and amounts are as follows

there are no governmental laws decrees or regulations in ireland that restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to nonresident holders of the company’s shares 

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the united states should be exempt from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from irish dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends 

with respect to noncorporate us shareholders certain dividends from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states such as our shares noncorporate us shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as investment income pursuant to section 163d4 of the code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation in addition the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances

we offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks and to enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract retain and engage a talented workforce our risk control services range from strategic risk consulting including providing actuarial analysis to a variety of due diligence services to the provision of practical onsite risk control services such as health and safety or property loss control consulting as well as analytical and advisory services such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies we assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur these services include contingency planning security audits and product tampering plans we help our clients enhance their business performance by delivering consulting services technology and solutions that help organizations anticipate identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals   

as an insurance broker we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements helping clients determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network we operate the largest private medicare exchange in the us through this exchange and those for active employees we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with healthcare benefits  

we are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account   

we derive the majority of our revenue from either commissions or fees for broking or consulting services no single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenues for any of the periods presented   

our shares are traded on the nasdaq global select market   

market conditions 

due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin a ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin rates however vary by geography 

industry and client segment as a result and due to the global and diverse nature of our business we view rates in the aggregate   

market conditions in our broking industry are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world insurance rate movements and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients   

management has considered the uk referendum vote on june 23 2016 to depart from the eu and the uncertainties about the nearterm and longerterm effects of brexit on the company the terms of brexit and its impact are highly uncertain for a further discussion of the risks of brexit to the company see part i item 1a risk factors within this annual report on form 10k   

typically our business benefits from regulatory change political risk or economic uncertainty insurance broking generally tracks the economy but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty we believe that the uk has good longterm growth opportunities and given that we believe the impact to willis towers watson will be neutral to slightly positive over the next couple of years with some periods of increase and decrease in that time frame we have some businesses such as our health and benefits and administration businesses which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change   

although approximately 23 of our revenues are generated in the uk on an annual basis only about 14 of revenues are denominated in pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in us dollars approximately 20 of our expenses are denominated in pounds sterling thus we generally benefit from a weakening pound in our income from operations however we have a company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business where revenues are generated in currencies different from the currency of the related expenses which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency   

the market for our consulting technology and solutions and private exchange services is subject to change as a result of economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors regulatory and legislative actions along with continuously evolving technological developments will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products we believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs with regard to the market for exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients a strong reputation for efficient execution a providers capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments and financing options and an innovative service delivery model and platform   

see part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k  for discussions of risks that may affect our ability to compete

in 2015 the foreign currency impact was as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar against a number of currencies most significantly the euro and the pound sterling

as reported segment revenues analysis 

during the second quarter of 2016 we began managing our business across four integrated reportable operating segments as a result the company has changed the way it manages and reports segment revenues and operating income resulting in a change in the company’s reportable segments from eight  reportable segments formerly known as willis international willis north america willis capital wholesale  reinsurance willis gb towers watson benefits towers watson exchange solutions towers watson risk and financial services and towers watson talent and rewards into four  reportable segments human capital and benefits corporate risk and broking investment risk and reinsurance and exchange solutions   

all prior period segment revenues information has been recast from our historically reported filings to conform to the current reportable segment structure   

segment revenues exclude amounts that were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and reimbursed by them reimbursed expenses however these amounts are included in consolidated revenues   

the merger affects the comparability of this data between 2016 and other periods presented see ‘supplementary pro forma segment revenues analysis’ for additional analysis   

beginning with 2017 we are realigning teams within some segments and will update our corporate expense allocation methodology to move additional costs which were formerly identified as corporate costs into the segments we may continue to refine teams business units and the cost allocation methodology as we continue the integration phase of the merger   

human capital and benefits   

the willis towers watson human capital  benefits ‘hcb’ segment provides an array of advice broking solutions and software for employee benefit plans the hr organization and the management teams of our clients

nongaap financial measures 

effective from january 1 2016 we have made changes to the nongaap financial measures that we use to provide additional meaningful methods of evaluating the company’s financial performance and have replaced our underlying and organic measures with those described below   

these changes have been made both as a direct consequence of the merger and to simplify and better align these measures with how we internally assess core performance and benchmark our operating results versus competitors   

in order to assist readers of our consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that willis towers watson’s management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning we present nongaap measures 1 adjusted revenues 2 constant currency change 3 organic change 4 adjusted operating income 5 adjusted ebitda 6 adjusted net income 7 adjusted diluted earnings per share 8 adjusted income before taxes 9 adjusted income taxestax rate and 10 free cash flow the company believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating and liquidity results   

within these measures we have adjusted for significant items which will not be settled in cash or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations these items include the following 

 these measures are different than those reported in our form 10k for the year ended december 31 2015 and filed with the sec on february 29 2016 historical nongaap measures have been recalculated using management’s new metrics for 2016   

these nongaap measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies nongaap measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for the information contained within our consolidated financial statements   

the pro forma financial information is only for willis and towers watson and does not include gras savoye or other ma activity on a pro forma basis   

adjusted revenues   

we consider adjusted revenues to be an important financial measure which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors adjusted revenues presents relevant periodoverperiod comparisons of revenues by excluding the impact of purchase accounting rules   

adjusted revenues  is defined as total revenues adjusted for the fair value adjustment for deferred revenues that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions gaap accounting requires the elimination of this revenue   

we have included the reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues in the table below together with our reconciliation of the pro forma revenues change to the constant currency and organic changes   

constant currency change and organic change   

we evaluate our revenues on an as reported us gaap constant currency and organic basis we believe providing constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally   

 the constant currency and organic change results and a reconciliation from the as reported results for consolidated revenues are included in the as reported consolidated financial information section within this form 10k these measures are also reported by segment in the as reported segment revenues analysis tables in that discussion and analysis   

a reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues for the year ended   december 31 2016  and pro forma 2015  and a reconciliation of the pro forma change to the constant currency and organic change for the year ended   december 31 2016  is as follows 

adjusted operating income   

we consider adjusted operating income to be an important financial measure which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors    

adjusted operating income is defined as income from operations adjusted for amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results   

a reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the year ended   december 31 2016  and pro forma year ended   december 31 2015  is as follows 

   

 adjusted operating income for the year ended   december 31 2016  was 16 billion  compared to pro forma 15 billion  for the year ended   december 31 2015  an increase of 109 million  the increase in adjusted operating income for the year ended   december 31 2016  was primarily driven by our acquisition of gras savoye the settlement with jlt of £28 million 41 million related to the fine art jewellery and specie team and the performance of our exchange solutions segment  

adjusted ebitda   

we consider adjusted ebitda to be an important financial measure which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations to benchmark our operating results against our competitors and to evaluate and measure our performancebased compensation plans   

adjusted ebitda is defined as net income adjusted for provision for income taxes interest expense depreciation and amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue gain on disposal of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results   

a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda for the year ended   december 31 2016   and pro forma year ended   december 31 2015  is as follows   



   

 adjusted ebitda for the year ended   december 31 2016  was 18 billion  compared to pro forma 17 billion  for the year ended   december 31 2015  an increase of 89 million  the increase in adjusted ebitda for the year ended   december 31 2016  was primarily driven by our acquisition of gras savoye the settlement with jlt of £28 million 41 million related to the fine art jewellery and specie team and the performance of our exchange solutions segment   

adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share   

adjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to willis towers watson adjusted for amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue gain on disposal of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments this measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share   

adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors adjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock diluted   

a reconciliation of net income attributable to willis towers watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended   december 31 2016  and 2015  is as follows 

   

 adjusted income before taxes and adjusted income taxestax rate   

adjusted income before taxes is defined as income from continuing operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates adjusted for amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue gain on disposal of operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate   

adjusted income tax rate is defined as provision for income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization restructuring costs transaction and integration expenses the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue gain on disposal of 

operations and nonrecurring items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results divided by adjusted income before taxes adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate    

management believes the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate we would incur if not for the reduction of pretax income of the adjusted items which are not core to our current and future operations   

a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates to adjusted income and provision for income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the year ended   december 31 2016  is as follows 

   



free cash flow   

free cash flow is used to evaluate our liquidity and is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use   

a summary of our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities along with a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow is as follows   



free cash flow for the year ended   december 31 2016  was 702 million  compared to free cash flow of 97 million  for the year ended   december 31 2015  the 677 million  increase in cash from operations in the year ended   december 31 2016  compared to the year ended   december 31 2015  was the primary driver for the increase in free cash flow periodoverperiod and was primarily due to cash from operations from legacy towers watson and gras savoye   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

these consolidated financial statements conform to us gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period our estimates judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates the areas that we believe are critical accounting policies include valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients discretionary compensation income taxes commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities pension assumptions and goodwill and intangible assets the critical accounting policies discussed below involve making difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations these critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption different estimates that we could have used or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the clients’ failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered including allowances when client disputes may exist the related provision is recorded as a reduction to revenue our allowance policy is based on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on the writeoff history facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due general market conditions current economic trends and our clients’ ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables 

discretionary compensation 

our compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash andor deferred stock units after our annual operating results are finalized 

an estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted if necessary by management to reflect changes in the forecast of prebonus profitability for the year 

income taxes 

the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the change is enacted deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as based on available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company adjusts valuation allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amount considered realizable in future periods if the company’s facts and assumptions change in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and the results of recent financial operations we place more reliance on evidence that is objectively verifiable 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance and consulting services in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice in certain cases where a range of loss exists we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount 

see note 13  — commitments and contingencies  in item 8 within this annual report on form 10k 

pension assumptions 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in several countries with the most significant defined benefit plans offered in the us and uk our disclosures in note 12  — retirement benefits  contain additional information about our other less significant but material retirement plans within our critical accounting policy discussion we have excluded analysis for plans outside of those noted in the description below as any variance of recorded information based on management’s estimates would be immaterial 

descriptions of our us and uk plans which comprise 91 of our projected benefit obligations and 94 of our plan assets are below 

united states 

legacy willis  – this plan covers approximately one third of the legacy willis employees in the united states and is now frozen with no new entrants nor future accruals 

legacy towers watson   – this plan covers substantially all legacy towers watson us employees with the exception of certain employees of our exchange solutions segment prior to december 31 2010 employees earned benefits under their original plan formulas which were frozen on december 31 2011 beginning january 1 2012 all legacy towers watson employees including named executive officers accrue qualified and nonqualified benefits under a stable value pension design 

2017 changes  – the legacy towers watson plan’s current noncontributory stable value formula is not available to employees hired or rehired on or after january 1 2017 beginning july 1 2017 legacy towers watson employees participating in the plan will accrue benefits under a new noncontributory stable value pension formula also beginning july 1 2017 the plan will cover newly eligible employees including employees hired on or after january 1 2017 and employees from legacy willis and the exchange solutions segment who elect to participate who do not ‘opt out’ under a new contributory stable value pension formula 

united kingdom 

legacy willis  – this plan covers approximately one third of the legacy willis employees in the united kingdom the plan is now closed to new entrants new employees in the united kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan 

legacy towers watson  – benefit accruals earned under the legacy watson wyatt defined benefit plan predominantly pension benefits ceased on february 28 2015 although benefits earned prior to january 1 2008 retain a link to salary until the employee leaves the company benefit accruals earned under the legacy towers perrin defined benefit plan predominantly lump sum benefits were frozen on march 31 2008 all participants now accrue defined contribution benefits 

legacy miller  – the plan provides retirement benefits based on members’ salaries at the point at which they ceased to accrue benefits under the scheme 

the determination of the company’s obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that given the longevity of the plans are longterm in focus a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation however certain of these changes such as changes in the discount rates and other actuarial assumptions are not recognized immediately in net income but are instead recorded in other comprehensive income the accumulated gains and losses not yet recognized in net income are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit costcredit based on the average working life expectancy of each of the plan’s active participants to the extent that the net gains or losses as of the beginning of the year exceed 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation 

willis towers watson considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions including economic forecasts relevant benchmarks historical trends portfolio composition and peer company comparisons these assumptions used to determine our pension liabilities and pension expense are reviewed annually by senior management and changed when appropriate a discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised to calculate the discount rate we use the granular approach to determining service cost and interest cost we began using this method to calculate the discount rate in 2016 this was treated as a change in accounting estimate and resulted in a credit of 51 million included in our total net periodic benefit income the expected rate of return assumptions for all plans are supported by an analysis of the weightedaverage yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality and the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases 

funding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes or as agreed to with the plan trustees for the uk plans since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes pension contributions are not equal to net periodic benefit cost 

we recorded a combined 124 million net periodic benefit income for our us and uk plans for the year ended december 31 2016 for the us and uk funded plans the following table presents our estimated net periodic benefit income for 2017 and the impact to both plans of a 025 increase and decrease to both the expected return on assets ‘eroa’ and the discount rate assumptions and the projected benefit obligations as of december 31 2016 and the impact of a 025 increase and decrease to the discount rates 



economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

goodwill and intangible assets — impairment review 

in applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with the remainder recorded as goodwill intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise the fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of october 1 and whenever indicators of impairment arise 

goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and the company had eight reporting units as of october 1 2016 

during fiscal year 2016  the company performed step 1 of the twostep impairment test for all reporting units each of the reporting units estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values to perform the test we used valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit that fall under income or market approaches under the discounted cash flow method an income approach the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debtfree aftertax cash flows for a finite period of years key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management business risk and expected rates of return on capital the guideline company method a market approach develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies key estimates and selection of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies obtaining estimates of forecast revenues and ebitda estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics under the similar transactions method a market approach actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units is used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units 

if the company was required to perform step 2 we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit used in step 1 to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination then the implied fair value of goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if goodwill is impaired for the year ended december 31 2016  we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill or intangibles 

recent accounting pronouncements 

while we are still in the process of analyzing the various accounting standards updates ‘asu’ issued by the financial accounting standards board ‘fasb’ those which we believe will have a material impact to our financial statements are listed below see note 2  — basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  within item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 








 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management   

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes   

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2  — basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  and note 9  — derivative financial instruments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k   

foreign exchange risk   

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results   

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenues and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the united states we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earn revenues in several currencies but incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling   

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2016  

   

 our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from   

 london market operations   

the company’s primary foreign exchange risks in its london market operations arise from changes in the exchange rate between us dollars and pounds sterling as its london market operations earn the majority of their revenues in us dollars and incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling and may also hold a significant net sterling asset or liability position on the balance sheet in addition the london market operations earn significant revenues in euro and japanese yen   

the foreign exchange risks in our london market operations are hedged to the extent that   



 however where the foreign exchange risk relates to any pounds sterling pension benefits assets or liability for pension benefits we do not hedge the risk consequently if our london market operations have a significant pension asset or liability we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income or loss if the us dollar and pounds sterling exchange rates change we do however hedge the pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan   

translation risk   

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower   

with the exception of foreign currency hedges for certain intercompany loans that are not designated as hedging instruments we do not hedge translation risk   

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within three years 

   





   

 income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the united kingdom is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities   

interest rate risk   

the company has access to i 800 million under a revolving credit facility expiring july 23 2018 ii 400 million under a revolving credit facility expiring april 28 2017 with a repayment date of april 28 2018 which will be available for regulatory capital purposes related to securities underwriting only and iii 20 million available under another revolving credit facility which is only available for specific regulatory purposes as of december 31 2016  238 million was drawn on these facilities we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in both us dollars and pounds sterling   

as a result of our operating activities we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies we earn interest on these funds which is included in our consolidated financial statements as interest income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity   

during the year ended december 31 2015 the company in order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest the use of interest rate contracts essentially converted groups of shortterm variable rate investments to fixed rates these derivatives were designated as hedging instruments and were for a total notional amount of 300 million   

the table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for interest rate swaps the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts the duration of the interest rate swaps was three years with refixing periods of three months average fixed and variable rates are respectively the weightedaverage actual and market rates for the interest rate hedges in place market rates are the rates prevailing at december 31 2016  or 2015 as appropriate we have evaluated the need for a sensitivity analysis and based on the companys debt we believe this to be immaterial   





     

 credit risk and concentrations of credit risk   

credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted the company currently does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties the company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk   

concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents fiduciary funds accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value   

the company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure these financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies   

concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the company does business as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the company’s concentrations of credit as of december 31 2016    




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the chief executive officer ‘ceo’ and chief financial officer ‘cfo’ of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation our management including the ceo and cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2016  in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports we file or submit under the exchange act is 1 recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and 2 accumulated and communicated to our management to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure   

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in the quarter ended december 31 2016  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our ceo and cfo and overseen by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that   

 internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk   

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company management has used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ‘coso’ in the report entitled internal control — integrated framework 2013  to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on this evaluation management has concluded that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016    

the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting has been audited by deloitte llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein

to the board of directors and shareholders of 

willis towers watson public limited company 

dublin ireland 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of willis towers watson public limited company and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2016  based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2016  of the company and our report dated march 1 2017  expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

clients 

our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from large major multinational corporations to middlemarket companies we work with major corporations emerging growth companies governmental agencies and notforprofit institutions in a wide variety of industries further many of our client relationships span decades for instance our relationship with the tokio marine and fire insurance company limited dates back over 100 years no one client accounted for a significant concentration of revenues for fiscal year 2015  additionally we place insurance with approximately 2500 insurance carriers none of which individually accounted for a significant concentration of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2015  

competition 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two other major providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and in some business lines marsh  mclennan and aon have greater market share than we do the global hr consulting industry includes other benefit and compensation firms and the human resource consulting divisions of diversified professional service firms including deloitte consulting llp accenture ernst  young llp and pricewaterhousecoopers llp 

competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

the human capital and risk management consulting industries are highly competitive we believe there are significant barriers to entry and we have developed competitive advantages in providing hr consulting and risk management consulting services we face strong competition from several sources 

our principal competitors in the pension consulting industry are mercer hr consulting a marsh  mclennan company and aon hewitt consulting an aon company beyond these large players the global hr consulting industry is highly fragmented 

our major competitors in the insurance consulting and software industry include milliman oliver wyman a marsh  mclennan company the big four accounting firms and sungard aon hewitt buck consultants a xerox company connextions a united healthcare company mercer a marsh  mclennan company automatic data processing and 

about willis towers watson 

fidelity are our primary competitors in the insurance exchange industry with the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act we also compete with the public exchanges run by the us federal and state governments we now compete with providers of accountbased health plans and consumerdirected benefits such as wageworks and healthequity 

the market for our services is subject to change as a result of economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors regulatory and legislative actions along with continuously evolving technological developments will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products we believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources consulting or risk management services firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs with regard to the market for exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients a strong reputation for efficient execution a provider’s capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments and financing options and an innovative service delivery model and platform for our traditional consulting and risk management services and the rapidly evolving exchange products we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors 

regulation 

our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasigovernmental regulatory supervision in all countries in which we operate also such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities while these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria our three most significant regulatory regions are described below 

united states 

our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the united states are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state insurance laws in the united states are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the states in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these states

european union

 item   1a   risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements these risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business the descriptions below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown to us may also impair our business operations financial condition or results if any of the risks and uncertainties below or other risks were to occur our business operations financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted with respect to the taxrelated consequences of acquisition ownership and disposal of ordinary shares you should consult with your own tax advisors 

risks relating to our business 

demand for our services could decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or prospects or a decline in defined benefit pension plans or the purchasing of insurance that could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we can give no assurance that the demand for our services will grow or that we will compete successfully with our existing competitors new competitors or our clients’ internal capabilities client demand for our services may change based on the clients’ needs and financial conditions 

our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve economic slowdowns in some markets have caused and may continue to cause reduction in discretionary spending by our clients result in longer client payment terms an increase in late payments by clients and an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable each of which may reduce the demand for our services increase price competition and adversely impact our growth profit margins and liquidity if our clients enter bankruptcy or liquidate their operations which has already occurred with respect to some of our current clients our revenues could be materially adversely affected 

while it is difficult to predict the consequences of any further deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing our services or insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the potential for a significant insurer to fail be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients 

in addition the demand for many of our core benefit services including compliancerelated services is affected by government regulation and taxation of employee benefit plans significant changes in tax or social welfare policy or other regulations could lead some employers to discontinue their employee benefit plans including defined benefit pension plans thereby reducing the demand for our services a simplification of regulations or tax policy also could reduce the need for our services 

we could be subject to claims arising from our work as well as government inquiries and investigations which could materially adversely affect our reputation business and financial condition 

we depend in large part on our relationships with clients and our reputation for highquality services to secure future engagements clients that become dissatisfied with our services may terminate their business relationships with us and clients and third parties that claim they suffered damages caused by our services may bring lawsuits against us we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the provision of our services or the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist our clients with matters including actuarial services and the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims involving substantial amounts of money errors and omissions claims against us may arise that allege our potential liability for all or part of the substantial amounts in question the nature of our work particularly our actuarial services necessarily involves the use of assumptions and the preparation of estimates relating to future and contingent events the actual outcome of which we cannot know in advance our actuarial and brokerage services also rely on substantial amounts of data provided by clients the accuracy and quality of which we cannot ensure in addition we could make computational software programming or data management errors in connection with the services we provide to clients 

clients may seek to hold us responsible for alleged errors or omissions related to any of the brokerage advice and services we provide including when claims they submit to their insurance carriers are disputed or denied for example clients may make 

risk factors 

 given that many of our clients have very high insurance policy limits to cover all of their risks alleged errors and omissions claims against us arising from disputed or denied claims are often significant therefore our exposure to liability on any particular engagement is often substantially greater than the revenue that the engagement generates for us moreover in a number of markets and in various circumstances our brokerage terms of business do not limit the maximum liability to which we may be exposed for claims involving alleged errors or omissions and as such we do not have limited liability for the work we provide to the associated clients 

clients may seek to hold us responsible for the financial consequences of variances between assumptions and estimates and actual outcomes or for errors for example clients may make 

 given that we frequently work with large pension funds and insurance companies relatively small percentage errors or variances can create significant financial variances and result in significant claims for unintended or unfunded liabilities the risks from such variances or errors could be aggravated in an environment of declining pension fund asset values and insurance company capital levels in almost all cases our exposure to liability with respect to a particular engagement is substantially greater than the revenue opportunity that the engagement generates for us 

in the case of liability for pension plan actuarial errors a client’s claims might focus on the client’s alleged reliance that actuarial assumptions were reasonable and based on such reliance the client made benefit commitments the client may later claim are not affordable or funding decisions that result in plan underfunding if and when actual outcomes vary from actuarial assumptions 

we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims an example of material claims for which we are subject that are outside of the error and omissions claims context relate to those arising out of the collapse of the stanford financial group for which we acted as brokers of record on certain lines of insurance we could be required to increase our financial reserve on the stanford litigation which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial statements or reputation 

the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may also be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships 

lawsuits arising out of any of our services could adversely affect our financial performance and financial condition and could result in increased insurance costs or a reduction in the amount of available insurance coverage in addition to defense costs and liability exposure which may be significant claims may produce negative publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and could require substantial amounts of management attention which could affect management’s focus on operations 

finally we may be subject to inquiries and investigations by federal state or other governmental agencies regarding aspects of our clients’ businesses or our own businesses especially regulated businesses such as our brokerdealer and investment advisory services such inquiries or investigations may consume significant management time and result in regulatory 

willis towers watson plc 

sanctions fines or other actions as well as significant legal fees which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and liquidity 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we comply with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states the united kingdom the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions around the world in which we operate in addition we own an interest in a number of associates where we do not exercise management control over the last few years regulators across the world are increasingly seeking to regulate brokers who operate in their jurisdictions the foreign and us laws and regulations applicable to our operations are complex continually evolving and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings these laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations economic and trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as cuba iran russia sudan and syria anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act 2010 and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us as well as import and export restrictions and laws and regulations related to data privacy and cyber security 

in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies monetary fines injunctions revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients while we believe that we have substantially increased our focus on the geographic breadth of regulations to which we are subject maintain good relationships with our key regulators and our current systems and controls are adequate we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of any applicable laws and regulations in particular given the challenges of integrating operations many of which are decentralized we cannot assure that our newlyacquired entities’ business systems and controls have prevented or will prevent any and all violations of applicable laws or regulations 

data security breaches or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

we depend on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients computer viruses hackers and other external hazards as well as improper or inadvertent staff behavior could expose confidential company and personal data systems to security breaches additionally one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their customers andor employees these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs 

with respect to our commercial arrangements with thirdparty vendors we have processes designed to require thirdparty it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyberattack on a vendor’s information systems 

we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information if any person including any of our colleagues fails to comply with disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines or criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through systems failure accident employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our colleagues or third parties could result in significant additional expenses including expenses relating to notification of data security breaches and costs of credit monitoring services negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation as well as require substantial resources and effort of management thereby diverting management’s focus and resources from business operations 

we have experienced a number of data incidents resulting from human error as well as attempts at unauthorized access to our systems we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this 

risk factors 

information however we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of data security breaches improper access to or disclosure of confidential company or personally identifiable information our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we hold and protect it from theft computer viruses hackers or inadvertent loss in such circumstances we may be held liable to our clients which could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue further data privacy information security identity theft and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements and customer expectations in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing hardware or systems could cause material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards and to be at the forefront of a range of technology relevant to our business 

if the data we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer hardware applications or software systems or if we experience other disruptions this could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breach power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations 

in particular our ability to recover from any disaster or other business continuity problem will depend on our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster 

we will continue to regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our business continuity plans however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

damage to our reputation could damage our businesses 

maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with clients and colleagues damage to our reputation could therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory action failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures and unethical behavior negative publicity whether or not true may also result in harm to our prospects 

we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest identifying conflicts of interest may prove particularly difficult in the nearterm while we bring together and integrate legacy willis legacy towers watson and gras savoye in addition we may encounter more conflicts of interest than anticipated in connection with the merger or the gras savoye acquisition and we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest 

willis towers watson plc 

the failure or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us 

our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational changes could impact our business results 

we have recently undergone several significant business and organizational changes including the merger the acquisitions of gras savoye and miller insurance services llp and our ongoing multiyear operational improvement program in addition as we have experienced competition to retain or recruit talent is heightened in a challenging rate environment or during a time when we are experiencing significant change effectively managing these organizational changes is critical to retaining talent servicing clients and our business success overall the failure to effectively manage such risks could adversely impact our business or financial results 

we do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive significant revenues from commissions for brokerage services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in the premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission levels may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin a ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin rates however vary by geography industry and client segment we have been and continue to be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions in addition insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as ourselves the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

we could incur substantial losses including with respect to our own cash and fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies and clients if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations failed 

we maintain significant cash balances at various us depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the us federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits we also maintain significant cash balances in foreign financial institutions a significant portion of this cash is fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies or clients if one or more of the institutions in which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses we would also be liable to claims made by the insurance companies or our clients regarding the fiduciary cash held on their behalf 

accepting market derived income mdi may cause regulatory or other scrutiny which may have a material and adverse effect on our business 

insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by commission or fees paid by clients intermediaries also obtain revenue from insurance carriers this is commonly known as market derived income or ‘mdi’ mdi takes a variety of forms including volume or profitbased contingent commissions facilities administration charges business development agreements and fees for providing certain data to carriers 

mdi creates various risks intermediaries have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ interests ahead of their clients accordingly mdi may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest antitrust unfair competition and antibribery laws and regulations while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice and while we have established systems and controls to manage these risks we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny 

investment in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment 

from time to time we may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there can be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts including the investment of significant time and resources the possibility that these efforts will be unprofitable and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and new products 

risk factors 

and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results for operations external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business in addition we can provide no assurance that the entry into new lines of business or development of new products and services will be successful 

we are continually developing and investing in new and innovative offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the market nevertheless the ability of these efforts to produce meaningful value is dependent on a number of other factors some of which are outside of our control 

the ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets related to the us budget deficit the uk’s potential exit from the european union the european sovereign debt crisis and the state of the us economic recovery may adversely affect the company’s operating results 

global financial markets continue to experience disruptions including increased volatility and diminished liquidity and credit availability in particular developments in europe have created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations this debt crisis and related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to deteriorate reducing the purchasing power of our european clients and reducing the translation of euro based revenues into us dollars for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 11 of legacy willis revenues were derived from countries which use the euro as their primary currency in the event that one or more countries were to replace the euro with their legacy currency then the company’s sales in and to such countries or europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates were established in addition the european crisis is contributing to instability in global credit markets if global economic and market conditions or economic and financial market conditions in europe the united states or other key markets remain uncertain persist or deteriorate further our clients may respond by suspending delaying or reducing their expenditures which may adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations finally the uk may seek to leave the european union the ‘eu’ and adopt an as yet unknown relationship with the eu if this occurred it could affect economic or market conditions in all of europe and beyond and could contribute to instability in global credit markets any such exit by the uk from the eu could have a material adverse affect on us and our operations 

the loss of key colleagues could damage or result in the loss of client relationships and could result in such colleagues competing against us 

our success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel including key managers and colleagues in addition our success largely depends upon our colleagues’ abilities to generate business and provide quality services in particular our colleagues’ business relationships with our clients are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements if we lose colleagues who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise or if we are unable to successfully attract new talent it could materially adversely affect our ability to secure and complete engagements which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects in addition we have experienced intense competition for certain types of colleagues in the past and if any of our key colleagues were to join a competitor or form a competing company or we are unable to continue to recruit key colleagues existing and potential clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of willis towers watson’s services 

over time the trend of employers shifting from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our retirement consulting and actuarial business comprises a substantial portion of our revenue and profit we provide clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans defined benefit pension plans generally require more actuarial services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools complex calculations to determine employer costs funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate or if we are unable to otherwise compensate for the decline in our business that results from employers moving away from defined benefit plans our business operations and related results of operations will be materially adversely affected 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various other risks that could impact our business 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the united states accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends

and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside the united states and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency for legacy willis operations in 2015 

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses together with any net sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollar denominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure 

for example as the pound sterling strengthens the us dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase which then causes our results to be negatively impacted however any net sterling asset we are holding will be more valuable when translated into us dollars given these facts the strength of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results this risk could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flow and results of operations in the future 

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal cultural market nationalization operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries 

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets the possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses these risks include 

 24 

risk factors 

our clients could terminate or reduce our services at any time which could decrease associate utilization adversely impacting our profitability and results of operations 

for consulting advisory and similar engagements our clients generally are able to terminate or reduce our engagements at any time if a client reduces the scope of or terminates the use of our services with little or no notice our associate utilization will decline in such cases we will need to rapidly redeploy our colleagues to other engagements if possible in order to minimize the potential negative impact on our financial performance in addition because a sizeable portion of our work is projectbased rather than recurring in nature our associate utilization will depend on our ability to continually secure additional engagements 

our quarterly revenues could fluctuate while our expenses are relatively fixed 

quarterly variations in our revenues and results of operations have occurred in the past and could occur as a result of a number of factors such as 

 a sizeable portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed encompassing the majority of administrative occupancy communications and other expenses depreciation and amortization and salaries and employee benefits excluding fiscal yearend incentive bonuses therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments or our inability to forecast demand can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results and could result in losses and volatility in our stock price 

improper management of our engagements could hurt our financial results 

most of our consulting services contracts are structured on a fixedfee basis or a timeandexpense basis the profitability of our fixedfee engagements depends on our ability to correctly estimate the costs and timing required for completion of the engagements and our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency the profitability of the engagements that are priced on a timeandexpense basis depends on our ability to maintain competitive billing rates as well as our ability to control our costs if we do not correctly estimate the costs and manage the performance of our engagements we may incur losses on individual engagements and experience lower profit margins and as a result our overall financial results could be materially adversely affected 

our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government regulations or if government regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs 

a material portion of our revenue is affected by statutory changes many areas in which we provide services are the subject of government regulation which is constantly evolving for example our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services are subject to regulation and supervision by national state or other authorities insurance laws in the markets in which we operate are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the markets in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these locations 

changes in government and accounting regulations in the united states and the united kingdom two of our principal geographic markets affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human capital programs including recent changes in regulations relating to health care such as medical plans defined contribution plans such as 401k plans defined benefit plans such as pension plans or executive compensation may materially adversely affect the demand for or the profitability of 

willis towers watson plc 

our services in addition more restrictive rules or interpretations of the federal centers for medicare services marketing rules or judicial decisions that restrict or otherwise change existing provisions of us healthcare regulation could have a material adverse impact on our exchange solutions business further changes to insurance regulatory schemes or our failure to keep pace with such changes could negatively affect demand for services in our investment risk and reinsurance business segment for example our continuing ability to provide investment advisory services depends on compliance with the rules and regulations in each of these jurisdictions any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to disciplinary action including compensating clients for loss the imposition of fines or the revocation of the authorization to operate as well as damage to our reputation 

in addition we have significant operations throughout the world which further subject us to applicable laws and regulations of countries outside the united states and the united kingdom changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators in particular countries including changes in administration and enforcement policies could require operational improvements or modifications which may result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business in those countries 

if we are unable to adapt our services to applicable laws and regulations our ability to provide effective services in these areas will be substantially diminished 

our business could be negatively affected by recently enacted or future legislative or regulatory activity concerning compensation consultants 

recent legislative and regulatory activity in the united states has focused on the independence of compensation consultants retained to provide advice to compensation committees of publicly traded companies in 2009 the sec published final rules which became effective in 2010 with respect to issuer disclosures on compensation consultants among other requirements the rules require disclosure of fees paid to compensation consultants as well as a description of any additional services provided to the issuer by the compensation consultant and its affiliates and the aggregate fees paid for such services due in part to this regulation and continued legislative activity some clients of legacy towers watson decided to terminate their relationships with the respective company either with respect to compensation consulting services or with respect to other consulting services to avoid perceived or potential conflicts of interest 

in addition in 2010 the us president signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act which requires the sec to issue rules directing national securities exchanges and associations to require the compensation committee of a listed company to consider the independence of an advisor when selecting a compensation consultant the sec was also required to identify factors affecting independence 

the final rules and nasdaq listing standards do not require that the selected compensation consultant be independent only that the compensation committee considers independence before selecting a compensation consultant however if companies’ compensation committees elect to engage compensation consultants that do not perform any other services for the company then this could cause additional clients to terminate their relationships with us either with respect to compensation consulting services or with respect to other consulting services to avoid perceived or potential conflicts of interest the merger could further exacerbate this problem for us as the combined company provides other nonexecutive compensation services to more clients and provides a greater aggregate amount of services to such clients if this happens the future termination of such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition due in part to such regulation and continued legislative activity some former legacy towers watson consultants terminated their relationships with us and many have begun to compete with us or have indicated that they intend to compete with us such talent migration and any future such talent migration could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

competition could result in loss of our market share and reduced profitability 

the markets for our principal services are highly competitive our competitors include other insurance brokerage human capital and risk management consulting and actuarial firms as well as the human capital and risk management divisions of diversified professional services insurance brokerage and accounting firms and specialist regional and local firms 

competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and marsh  mclennan and aon for examples have greater market share in certain lines of business than we do some of our competitors have greater financial technical and marketing resources than us which could enhance their ability to finance acquisitions fund internal growth and respond more quickly to professional and technological changes some competitors have or may develop a lower cost structure or have more taxefficient operations new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge creating additional 

risk factors 

competition and gaining significant market share resulting in a loss of business for us and a corresponding decline in revenues and profit margin in order to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure we may have to lower our prices which would also have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin 

the human capital and risk management consulting industries are highly competitive we face strong competition from several sources our principal competitors in the pension consulting industry are mercer hr consulting a marsh  mclennan company and aon hewitt consulting an aon company beyond these large players the global hr consulting industry is highly fragmented 

our competitors in the insurance consulting and software industry include milliman oliver wyman a marsh  mclennan company the big four accounting firms and sungard aon hewitt buck consultants a xerox company connextions a united healthcare company and mercer a marsh  mclennan company are among our competitors in the insurance exchange industry with the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act we also compete with the public exchanges run by the us federal and state governments with the acquisition of acclaris we now compete with providers of accountbased health plans and consumerdirected benefits such as wageworks and healthequity 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could materially adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations we may experience a decrease in the amount of services we perform for these clients if one of our clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could materially adversely affect our revenues and profits 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions and if we have difficulty in acquiring overpay for or are unable to acquire other businesses our business may be materially adversely affected 

our growth depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions we may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms acceptable or favorable to us on the proposed timetables or at all we also face additional risks related to acquisitions including that we could overpay for acquired businesses and that any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to our expectations if we are unable to identify and successfully make acquisitions our business could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks when we acquire or divest businesses and may have difficulty integrating or managing acquired businesses or with effecting internal reorganizations which may harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation 

we may acquire other companies or divest certain businesses in the future we cannot be certain that our acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or that our acquisitions or divestitures will otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if the operating performance of an acquired business deteriorates significantly we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet 

we may be unable to effectively integrate an acquired business into our organization and may not succeed in managing such acquired businesses or the larger company that results from such acquisitions the process of integration of an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks including 

 

willis towers watson plc 

 we may also face similar challenges in effecting internal reorganizations if acquisitions or internal reorganizations are not successfully integrated our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as well as our professional reputation 

we also own an interest in a number of associates where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore limited in our ability to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we can achieve if we had full ownership 

we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding investments whose results are not guaranteed and clients that experience investment return shortfalls may assert claims against us 

we provide advice on both asset allocation and selection of investment managers for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on both these matters or we may serve in a fiduciary capacity asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and investment managers may underperform their benchmarks in both cases the investment return shortfall can be significant clients experiencing this underperformance may assert claims against us and such claims may be for significant amounts defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs our ability to limit our potential liability may be limited in certain jurisdictions or in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary duties or other alleged errors or omissions 

our investment activities may require specialized operational competencies and if we fail to properly execute our role in cash and investment management our clients or third parties may assert claims against us 

for certain clients we are responsible for some portions of cash and investment management including rebalancing of investment portfolios and guidance to third parties on structure of derivatives and securities transactions our failure to properly execute our role can cause monetary damage to our clients or such third parties for which we might be found liable and such claims may be for significant amounts defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs our ability to limit our potential liability may be constrained in certain jurisdictions 

new product or service offerings may carry greater risk of liability and regulatory action than existing or historical product or service offerings 

we continue to grow the business of providing products and services to institutional investors financial services companies and other clients the risk of claims from these lines of business and related products and services may be greater than from our core businesses and such claims may be for significant amounts for example we may assist a pension plan to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates if the hedge does not perform as expected we could be exposed to claims contractual provisions intended to mitigate risk may not be enforceable other examples of recently implemented ventures that may increase our exposure to client and regulator claims include pooled investment solutions in various jurisdictions in our investment line of business new licensed work and expansion into new jurisdictions in our health and group benefits line of business and in our retirement line of business establishing and servicing structures to facilitate the funding of our clients’ employee benefit plans in addition with respect to some of these new ventures we may enter into arrangements that need to be examined to determine whether they fall under the variable interest entity vie accounting guidance the structure of such arrangements could require us to consolidate assets or liabilities on which we do not have risk of loss 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology to drive value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely and costeffective manner and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant cost our competitors are seeking to develop competing technologies and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly or effectively as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements 

risk factors 

limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 

we cannot guarantee that trade secret trademark and copyright law protections are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property including our software which may become an increasingly important part of our business existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights redressing infringements may consume significant management time and financial resources also we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot be sure that our services and products or the products of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients these claims may harm our reputation result in financial liability and prevent us from offering some services or products 

insurance may become more difficult or expensive to obtain 

the availability terms and price of insurance are subject to many variables including general insurance market conditions loss experience in related industries and in the actuarial and benefits consulting industry and the specific claims experience of an individual firm we are subject to various regulatory requirements relating to insurance as well as client requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance at costeffective rates or with reasonable retentions increases in the cost of insurance could affect our profitability and the unavailability of insurance to cover certain risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our ability to transact business in certain geographic areas particularly in any specific period 

we have material pension liabilities that can fluctuate significantly 

we have material pension liabilities some of which represented unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement liabilities movements in the interest rate environment inflation or changes in other assumptions that are used for the estimates of our benefit obligations and other factors could have a material effect on the level of liabilities in these plans at any given time these pension plans have minimum funding requirements that may require material amounts of periodic additional funding the need to make additional cash contributions may reduce our financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or other needs of our business 

our exchange solutions business may be harmed if we lose our relationships with insurance carriers fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers become dependent upon a limited number of insurance carriers or fail to develop new carrier relationships 

our exchange solutions business typically enters into contractual agency relationships with insurance carriers that are nonexclusive and terminable on short notice by either party for any reason in many cases insurance carriers also have the ability to amend the terms of our agreements unilaterally on short notice insurance carriers may be unwilling to allow us to sell their existing or new health insurance plans or may amend our agreements with them for a variety of reasons including for competitive or regulatory reasons or because of a reluctance to distribute their products through our exchange platform insurance carriers may decide to rely on their own internal distribution channels including traditional inhouse agents carrier websites or other sales channels or to market their own plans and in turn could limit or prohibit us from marketing their plans for example in august 2011 one of exchange solutions’ largest insurance carrier partners discontinued the indirect distribution of medicare supplement policies through all of their distribution vendors as a result our new medicare supplement enrollments shifted to other insurance carriers that pay us lower commission rates on average insurance carriers may also choose to exclude us from their most profitable or popular plans or may determine not to distribute insurance plans in individual markets in certain geographies or altogether additionally if one of the insurance carriers with which we are associated violates the law or comes under scrutiny by the centers for medicare  medicaid services ‘cms’ cms may impose sanctions on such carriers resulting in a loss of supply of insurance plans that we are able to sell the termination or amendment of our relationship with an insurance carrier could reduce the variety of health insurance plans we offer we also could lose a source of or be paid reduced commissions for future sales and could lose renewal commissions for past sales our business could also be harmed if we fail to develop new carrier relationships or are unable to offer customers a wide variety of health insurance plans 

the private health insurance industry in the united states has experienced a substantial amount of consolidation over the past several years resulting in a decrease in the number of insurance carriers in the future it may become necessary for us to offer insurance plans from a reduced number of insurance carriers or to derive a greater portion of our revenue from a more 

willis towers watson plc 

concentrated number of carriers as our business and the health insurance industry evolve for example in the period from july 1 2014 to june 30 2015 the top five carriers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 72 of our commission revenue in our retiree  access exchanges business each of these insurance carriers may terminate our agreements with them and in some cases as a result of the termination we may lose our right to receive future commissions for policies we have sold should our dependence on a smaller number of insurance carriers increase whether as a result of the termination of carrier relationships further insurance carrier consolidation or otherwise we may become more vulnerable to adverse changes in our relationships with our carriers particularly in states where we offer health insurance plans from a relatively small number of carriers or where a small number of insurance carriers dominate the market the termination amendment or consolidation of our relationship with our insurance carriers could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes and developments in the health insurance system in the united states could harm our exchange solutions business 

in 2010 the federal government enacted significant reforms to healthcare legislation through the patient protection and affordable care act ‘ppaca’ and the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 ‘hcera’ which we refer to collectively as ‘healthcare reform’ our exchange solutions business depends upon the private sector of the united states insurance system its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use of and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance plans healthcare reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the industry in which we operate in substantial ways 

many aspects of healthcare reform are not yet in effect or have only recently gone into effect in addition state governments have adopted and will continue to adopt changes to their existing laws and regulations in light of healthcare reform and related regulations future postponements of or changes to healthcare reform may not be beneficial to us 

certain key members of congress have expressed a desire to withhold the funding necessary to implement healthcare reform as well as the desire to replace or amend all or a portion of healthcare reform any partial or complete repeal or amendment or implementation difficulties or uncertainty regarding such events could increase our costs of compliance prevent or delay future adoption of our exchange platform and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition the implementation of healthcare reform could have negative effects on us including 

 any of these effects could materially harm our business results of operations and financial condition for example the manner in which the federal government and the states implement health insurance exchanges and the process for receiving subsidies and costsharing credits could substantially increase our competition and member turnover and substantially reduce the number of individuals who purchase insurance through us various aspects of healthcare reform could cause insurance carriers to limit the type of health insurance plans we are able to sell and the geographies in which we are able to sell them in addition the us congress has been charged with finding spending cuts and such cuts are expected to include medicare if cuts are made to medicare there may be substantial changes in the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell changes in the law could also cause insurance carriers to exit the business of selling insurance plans in a particular jurisdiction to eliminate certain categories of products or to attempt to move members into new plans for which we receive lower commissions if insurance carriers decide to limit our ability to sell their plans or determine not to sell individual health insurance plans altogether our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed 

risk factors 

our exchange solutions’ business may not grow as quickly as expected or its growth may occur faster than expected and we may not have the resources required to support it 

if clients do not select private healthcare exchanges do not select our healthcare exchange business or if clients move to exchanges more slowly than we have anticipated then our exchange solutions’ business and operating results may be materially adversely affected if conversely revenue from our exchange solutions’ business does grow significantly there is the risk that we do not have the resources required to support such revenue growth 

our consumerdirected accounts business is dependent upon the availability of taxadvantaged consumerdirected benefits to employers and employees and any diminution in elimination of or change in the availability of these benefits would materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition business and prospects 

our consumerdirected accounts business fundamentally depends on employer and employee demand for taxadvantaged consumerdirected benefits or cdbs any diminution in or elimination of the availability of cdbs for employees would materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition business and prospects in addition incentives for employers to offer cdbs may also be reduced or eliminated by changes in laws that result in employers no longer realizing financial gain from the implementation of these benefits if employers cease to offer cdb programs or reduce the number of programs they offer to their employees the results of operations financial condition business and prospects of our consumerdirected accounts business would also be materially adversely affected 

in addition if the payroll tax savings employers currently realize from their employees’ utilization of cdbs become reduced or unavailable employers may be less inclined to offer these programs to their employees if the tax savings currently realized by employee participants by utilizing cdbs were reduced or unavailable we expect employees would correspondingly reduce or eliminate their participation in such cdb plans any such reduction in employer or employee incentives would materially adversely affect the results of operations financial condition business and prospects of our consumerdirected accounts business 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed and we expect to significantly increase goodwill as a result of the merger we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility 

legacy willis had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 33 billion  as of december 31 2015 and legacy willis’ 2015 interest expense was 142 million  legacy towers watson had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 740 million as of december 31 2015 and legacy towers watson’s interest expense was 10 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 

although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may 

 31 

willis towers watson plc 

the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments the operating restrictions and financial covenants in our credit facilities do and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 

the maintenance and growth of our business depends on our access to capital which will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all in addition approximately 988 million  of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2015 and an additional 400 million drawn related to the merger will mature in 2016 we may be unable to refinance this maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on us 

a downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility and under certain circumstances may require us to offer to buy back some of our outstanding debt 

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility in addition certain downgrades would trigger a stepup in interest rates under the indentures for our 6200 senior notes due 2017 and our 7000 senior notes due 2019 which would increase our interest expense if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources 

in addition under the indenture for our 4625 senior notes due 2023 and our 6125 senior notes due 2043 if we experience a ratings decline together with a change of control event we would be required to offer to purchase our 4625 senior notes due 2023 and our 6125 senior notes due 2043 from holders unless we had previously redeemed those notes we may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

we rely on third parties to provide services and their failure to perform the services could harm our business 

as part of providing services to clients and managing our business we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers our ability to perform effectively depends in part on the ability of these service providers to meet their obligations as well as on our effective oversight of their performance the quality of our services could suffer or we could be required to incur unanticipated costs if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as expected or their services are disrupted this could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries for example willis limited our uk brokerage subsidiary regulated by the fca is currently required to maintain 126 million in unencumbered and available funds of which at least 79 million must be in cash for regulatory purposes in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on common stock 

risk factors 

further the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are made from the us it is important to be able to access cash generated outside the us funds from the company’s operating subsidiaries outside of the us are periodically repatriated to the us via shareholder distributions and repayment of intercompany financing a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to foreign exchange rates and taxrelated costs 

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to revenue recognition valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients discretionary compensation incurred but not reported liabilities restructuring pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates and changes in accounting standards could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 

our accounting for our longterm outsourcing contracts requires using estimates and projections that may change over time these changes may have a significant or adverse effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition 

projecting contract profitability on our longterm outsourcing contracts requires us to make assumptions and estimates of future contract results all estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to change in an effort to maintain appropriate estimates we review each of our longterm outsourcing contracts the related contract reserves and intangible assets on a regular basis if we determine that we need to change our estimates for a contract we will change the estimates in the period in which the determination is made these assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion which may also evolve over time in light of operational experience regulatory direction developments in accounting principles and other factors further changes in assumptions estimates or developments in the business or the application of accounting principles related to longterm outsourcing contracts may change our initial estimates of future contract results application of and changes in assumptions estimates and policies may adversely affect our financial results 

risks relating to integration following the merger and the gras savoye acquisition 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger or the gras savoye acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the businesses 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger and the gras savoye acquisition will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the businesses the combination of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integration activities the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively could restrict the realization of the fullexpected benefits the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the overall integration may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of client relationships and diversion of management’s attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

 33 

willis towers watson plc 

 many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if our operations are integrated successfully the full benefits of the transactions may not be realized including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integrations all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected benefits of the merger or the gras savoye acquisition and negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares as a result we cannot assure you that the merger or the gras savoye acquisition will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated 

certain business uncertainties arising from the merger or the gras savoye acquisition could adversely affect our businesses and operations 

uncertainties about the effect of the merger and the gras savoye acquisition on employees customers suppliers business partners and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may have an adverse effect on us during times of significant change and uncertainty such as the period following the merger and the gras savoye acquisition customers suppliers business partners and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer business decisions decide to terminate modify or renegotiate their relationships with us or take other actions as a result of the merger or the gras savoye acquisition that could negatively affect our revenues earnings and cash flows as well as the market price of our securities our ability to raise additional capital through the debt markets and the associated borrowing costs may also be negatively impacted any such effects could limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or the gras savoye acquisition 

these uncertainties about the effect of the merger and the gras savoye acquisition may also impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel employee retention may be challenging as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles or may be dissatisfied with their new roles if key employees depart our business could be materially harmed if key employees join a competitor or form a new competitor existing and potential clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

  we have incurred and will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the merger and the gras savoye acquisition 

we have incurred substantial expenses in connection with completing the merger and the gras savoye acquisition and expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with coordinating and integrating the businesses operations policies and procedures of the combined companies while we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and coordination expenses will be incurred there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these transaction and coordination expenses many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately these expenses may exceed the costs historically borne by us these costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

risks related to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

our status as a foreign corporation for us federal tax purposes could be affected by a change in law 

we believe that under current law we are treated as a foreign corporation for us federal tax purposes however changes to the inversion rules in code section 7874 or the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder or other irs guidance could adversely affect our status as a foreign corporation for us federal tax purposes and any such changes could have prospective 

risk factors 

or retroactive application to us our shareholders andor our affiliates in addition recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of us corporate tax residence and such legislation if passed could have an adverse effect on us for example in february 2016 the president of the united states proposed legislation which would amend the antiinversion rules to apply to a broader range of transactions although its application is limited to transactions closing after 2016 no assurance can be given that such proposal would not be changed in the legislative process and be enacted to apply to prior transactions in addition certain members of congress have introduced similar legislation that would apply retroactively to transactions including the merger closing in may 2014 or later if such legislation were enacted it could cause willis towers watson to be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes as of or after the merger furthermore in september 2014 and november 2015 the us treasury department and the irs issued additional guidance stating that they intend to issue additional regulations under section 7874 the application of such regulations to the merger is not clear and no assurance can be given that such regulations would not cause us to be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes or have other negative implications for our business it is possible that legislation or regulation enacted now or in the future could apply retroactively to cause us to be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes as of or after the merger 

legislative or regulatory action in the us could materially adversely affect us 

legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely or otherwise affect the taxes that the united states imposes on our worldwide operations regulations or administrative guidance from the us treasury department could have similar consequences such changes could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that had the effect of limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the united states we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise incur business detriment 

future changes to us and foreign tax laws could adversely affect us 

the us congress the organisation for economic cooperation and development and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates in october 2015 the organisation for economic cooperation and development released final reports addressing fifteen specific actions as part of a comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the united states ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

  we may not be able to maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from expectations and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

the laws of ireland differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

a judgment obtained against us will be enforced by the courts of ireland if the following general requirements are met i us courts must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to irish conflict of law rules the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule and ii the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it a judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal 

willis towers watson plc 

or even if an appeal is pending where however the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment it is possible that in the meantime the judgment may not be actionable in ireland it remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive however irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the us courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons i if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money ii if the judgment was obtained by fraud iii the enforcement of the judgment in ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice iv the judgment is contrary to irish public policy or involves certain us laws which will not be enforced in ireland or v jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service ireland or outside ireland under order 11 of the ireland superior courts rules 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

risks relating to our ordinary shares 

the stock price of our ordinary shares may be volatile 

the stock price of our ordinary shares may in the future be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our ordinary shares may in the future fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our ordinary shares include 

 there can be no assurance that the stock price of the ordinary shares will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance 

risk factors 

transfers of our ordinary shares other than by means of the transfer of bookentry interests in the depository trust company ‘dtc’ may be subject to irish stamp duty 

it is expected that for the majority of transfers of our ordinary shares there will not be any stamp duty transfers of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in dtc are not subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold our ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of our ordinary shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through dtc or vice versa without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that there is no change in the beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and the transfer is not in contemplation of a sale of the shares by a beneficial owner to a third party we intend but have no obligation to pay stamp duty in certain circumstances 

payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares 

in certain limited circumstances dividends paid by us may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain limited circumstances irish dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ currently at a rate of 20 may arise in respect of dividends if any paid on our ordinary shares a number of exemptions from dwt exist including exemptions pursuant to which shareholders resident in the us and shareholders resident in certain other countries may be entitled to exemptions from dwt 

ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax ‘cat’ currently levied at a rate of 33 above certain taxfree thresholds could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our ordinary shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland for irish cat purposes the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat 




 item 1b — unresolved staff comments 

the company had no unresolved comments from the sec’s staff 




 item 2 — properties 

as of december 31 2015  we operated offices in more than 120 countries throughout the world and believe that our properties are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used the principal properties are located in the united kingdom and the united states operations of each of our segments are carried out in owned or leased offices under operating leases that typically do not exceed 10 years in length except for certain properties in key locations we do not anticipate difficulty in meeting our space needs at lease expiration 

the fixed assets owned by legacy willis represented approximately 3  of total assets as of december 31   2015  and consisted primarily of computer equipment and software office furniture and leasehold improvements 




 item 3 — legal proceedings 

claims lawsuits and other proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings some of the claims lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could if assessed be significant we do not expect the impact of claims or demands not described below to be material to the company’s financial statements the company also receives subpoenas in the ordinary course of business and from time to time receives requests for information in connection with governmental investigations 

errors and omissions claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance the terms of this insurance vary by policy year regarding selfinsured risks the company has established provisions which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice or in certain cases where a range of loss exists the company accrues the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the company adjusts such provisions from time to time according to developments 

on the basis of current information the company does not expect that the actual claims lawsuits and other proceedings to which the company is subject or potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity nonetheless given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and disputes with insurance companies it is possible that an adverse outcome or settlement in certain matters could from time to time have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 

the company provides for contingent liabilities based on asc 450 contingencies  when it is determined that a liability inclusive of defense costs is probable and reasonably estimable the contingent liabilities recorded are primarily developed actuarially litigation is subject to many factors which are difficult to predict so there can be no assurance that in the event of a material unfavorable result in one or more claims we will not incur material costs

city of houston 

on august 1 2014 the city of houston ‘plaintiff’ filed suit against legacy towers watson in the united states district court for the southern district of texas houston division 

in the complaint plaintiff alleges various deficiencies in pension actuarial workproduct and advice stated to have been provided by legacy towers watson’s predecessor firm towers perrin in its capacity as principal actuary to the houston firefighters’ relief and retirement fund the ‘fund’ towers perrin is stated to have acted in this capacity between “the early 1980s until 2002” 

in particular the complaint is critical of two reports allegedly issued by towers perrin  one in february 2000 and the other in april 2000  containing actuarial valuations upon which plaintiff claims to have relied plaintiff claims that the reports indicated that the city’s minimum contribution percentages to the fund would remain in place through at least 2018 and that existing benefits under the fund could be increased and new benefits could be added without increasing plaintiff’s financial burden and without increasing plaintiff’s rate of annual contributions to the fund the complaint alleges that plaintiff relied on these reports when supporting a new benefit package for the fund these reports and other advice are alleged among other things to have been negligent to have misrepresented the present and future financial condition of the fund and the contributions required to be made by plaintiff to support those benefits plaintiff asserts that but for towers perrin’s alleged negligence and misrepresentations plaintiff would not have supported the benefit increase and that such increased benefits would not and could not have been approved or enacted it is further asserted that towers perrin’s alleged “negligence and misrepresentations damaged the city to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in annual contributions” 

plaintiff seeks the award of actual damages exemplary damages special damages attorney’s fees and expenses costs of suit pre and post judgment interest at the maximum legal rate and other unspecified legal and equitable relief plaintiff has not yet quantified fully its asserted damages 

on october 10 2014 legacy towers watson filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff’s entire complaint on the basis that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted on november 21 2014 the city filed its response in opposition to legacy towers watson’s motion to dismiss on september 23 2015 legacy towers watson’s motion to dismiss was denied by the united states district court for the southern district of texas houston division

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the united states should be exempt from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from irish dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends

market conditions 

the following describes market conditions impacting legacy willis operations in the periods ended december 31 2015 and 2014 

due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin a ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin rates however vary by geography industry and client segment as a result and due to the global and diverse nature of our business we view rates in the aggregate 

market conditions in our industry are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world insurance rate movements and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients 

in 2014 we noted a continuation of the trend of growing complexity in the reinsurance market and a softening of prices and signs of acceleration towards softening reinsurance rates across almost all classes of business and geographies as positive 2013 results for traditional reinsurers exacerbated the growing supply of capital from thirdparty investors in addition for primary insurance companies the ability to recognize primary rate increases may be coming to an end and consequently rate flattening and even rate reductions are seen in many territories on primary insurance classes 

in 2015 we saw an easing of both reinsurance and primary insurance rates across most lines of business although the rate of decline varies significantly by market and geography and the marketplace continues to both favor and offer opportunities for the buyers of reinsurance markets clearly continue to face significant overcapacity and competitive pricing conditions and 

willis towers watson plc 

overall underwriting margins remain under substantial pressure although we are beginning to see the return of more normal market conditions these challenging and uneven market conditions may result in quarterly volatility in actual financial performance in comparison to our 2015 strategic and financial goals 

in the face of this challenging economic environment we have adopted a strategy to 1 invest selectively in growth areas defined by geography industry sector and client segment and 2 better coordinate our segments so as to bring our clients greater access to the company’s specialty areas and analytical capabilities our growth strategy also involves increasing our investment in and deployment of our analytical capabilities 

with respect to the legacy towers watson operations the market for our services is subject to change as a result of economic regulatory and legislative changes technological developments and increased competition from established and new competitors regulatory and legislative actions along with continuously evolving technological developments will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products we believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation the ability to provide measurable increases to stockholder value and return on investment global scale quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs with regard to the market for exchanges we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients a strong reputation for efficient execution a providers capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments and financing options and an innovative service delivery model and platform for our traditional consulting and risk management services and the rapidly evolving exchange products we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors 

financial performance 

the following is a summary of legacy willis’ 2015 gaap financial results 

 our nongaap financial measures were as follows

management’s discussion and analysis 

 acquisitions and disposals 

legacy willis continued to successfully deliver on its measured acquisition strategy which has been focused on high quality specialized firms with leading market positions and has continued to contribute to the company’s overall growth rate 

revenues from the twelvemonth impact of acquisitions net of disposals have increased total revenues by 157 million more in 2015 than in 2014 additionally the twelvemonth impact of acquisitions net of disposals has contributed approximately 12 million more to ebitda compared with 2014 

the following are the key legacy willis acquisitions completed during 2015 

 during 2015 legacy willis also acquired 

 operational improvement program 

in april 2014 legacy willis announced an operational improvement program that would allow it to continue to strengthen its client service realize operational efficiencies and invest in new capabilities for growth 

the main elements of the program include the following 

 the program began in the second quarter of 2014 and is expected to be complete by the end of 2017 the program was expecting to deliver cumulative cost savings of at least 420 million through 2017 and annual cost savings of approximately 300 million starting in 2018 however due to strong execution against the overall strategy to date the company has increased 

willis towers watson plc 

its expectations for cost savings from the program the annual cost savings expected to be generated by the end of 2017 are now expected to be 325 million and the cumulative savings are now expected to be in excess of 490 million through the end of the program the program cumulative expected savings exclude mergerrelated savings 

actual cost savings of approximately 123 million were achieved in 2014 and 2015 taken together and the estimated phasing of future cost savings is as follows up to approximately 150 million in 2016 and up to approximately 250 million in 2017 the estimated cost savings are before any potential reinvestment for future growth 

to achieve these savings the company now expects to incur restructuring charges amounting up to approximately 440 million through the end of 2017 program spend in 2014 and 2015 taken together was 162 million with approximately 140 million expected for 2016 and the balance of approximately 125 million expected to be incurred in 2017 

total spend actual savings and timing may vary positively or negatively from these estimates due to changes in the scope underlying assumptions or execution risk of the restructuring plan throughout its duration 

the company expects that about 75 percent of the annualized 2018 savings would come from role relocation and reduction and about 25 percent of the savings from real estate information technology and other areas 

relevant legacy willis metrics are 

 by releasing 93000 square feet of space since march 2014 we have been able to have more employees occupy a smaller area we are still adding employees to our new office in tampa florida completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 which has impacted the desk per fte ratio as have the additional desks required throughout the business for contractors and consultants not included in the fte headcount 

the restructuring costs of 126 million related to the operational improvement program incurred in 2015 were 

 uk defined benefit pension scheme 

salary freeze 

on march 6 2015 legacy willis announced to members of the uk defined benefit pension plan that with effect from june 30 2015 future salary increases would not be pensionable the ‘salary freeze’ the company has recognized the salary freeze as a plan amendment at the announcement date the impact of the salary freeze is to reduce the plan’s projected benefit obligation by approximately 215 million and create a prior service credit which is recognized in other comprehensive income loss and then amortized to the statement of operations over the remaining expected service life of active employees 

management’s discussion and analysis 

schedule of contributions 

on december 31 2015 legacy willis agreed to a revised schedule of contributions towards ongoing accrual of benefits and deficit funding contributions the company will make to the uk plan to the end of 2024 the revised schedule of contributions replaces the previous agreement and therefore eliminates the clauses over profit share contributions and exceptional return contributions that became payable in certain circumstances 

based on the revised agreement contributions in 2016 will total approximately 83 million being deficit funding contributions of approximately 53 million ongoing contributions of approximately 22 million and the final contingent contribution of approximately 8 million following the share buybacks made in 2015 

annual deficit funding contributions will reduce to approximately 22 million for 2017 through 2020 although additional ‘funding level’ contributions may become payable based on funding level assessments made between december 31 2017 and 2024 such annual funding level contributions are capped at approximately 15 million from 2021 annual deficit funding contributions may be ceased and instead paid into escrow if the scheme is ahead of its funding plan 

nongaap financial measures 

legacy willis nongaap financial measures for 2015 

we believe that the understanding of the company’s performance and comparative analysis of our results is enhanced by our disclosure of the following nongaap financial measures we use these and other measures to establish group performance targets and evaluate the performance of our operations 

our method for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited our calculation methods are 

 our underlying nongaap measures are calculated by excluding restructuring costs relating to the operational improvement program the impact of the venezuelan bolivar devaluation certain litigation provisions gains losses on disposal of operations remeasurement of previously held equity interests nonrecurring changes in deferred tax valuation allowances and from the second quarter of 2015 merger and acquisition ‘ma’ transactionrelated costs as relevant from total revenues total expenses salaries and benefits other operating expenses operating income net income and diluted earnings per share the most directly comparable gaap measures as a result of excluding merger and acquisition transactionrelated costs from the second quarter of 2015 underlying nongaap measures for 2014 have been restated 

additionally prior year total revenues total expenses net income and diluted earnings per share have been rebased to current period exchange rates to eliminate the impact of yearoveryear foreign exchange movements 

 our organic nongaap measures are calculated by further excluding the twelvemonth impact from acquisitions and disposals from our underlying measures 

as set out in the tables below underlying operating income increased 50 million or 76 percent to 707 million in 2015 compared with 657 million in 2014 underlying operating margin at 185 percent in 2015 was up 10 basis points compared with 2014 while 2015 underlying net income was 441 million 44 million higher than in 2014 underlying earnings per diluted share were 639 in 2015 compared with 583 in 2014 

as set out in the tables below organic operating income increased 74 million or 117 percent to 706 million in 2015 compared with 632 million in 2014 organic operating margin at 195 percent in 2015 was up 150 basis points compared with 2014

total revenues by segment for 2015 and 2014 are shown below millions except percentages 



 

 total revenues of 3829 million increased by 27 million or 07 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 this was primarily due to 11 percent growth in commissions and fees 

total commissions and fees in 2015 were 3809 million up 42 million or 11 percent from 3767 million in 2014 this increase was comprised of organic growth of 115 million or 33 percent and growth through acquisitions and disposals of 155 million or 43 percent partially offset by negative foreign currency movements of 228 million or 65 percent 

the foreign currency impact was as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar against a number of currencies most significantly the euro and the pound sterling 

willis gb reported a 38 percent reduction in commissions and fees as organic growth of 18 percent was offset by a 54 percent negative impact from foreign currency translation and a net 02 percent decline from acquisitions and disposals primarily due to the disposal of our niche classic car business and preston and dundee retail operations partially offset by the acquisition of pmi and certain miller businesses 

organic commissions and fees growth of 18 percent was primarily due to growth in financial lines property  casualty and aerospace 

willis capital wholesale  reinsurance reported 83 percent growth in commissions and fees comprising 10 percent organic growth and an 115 percent positive impact from acquisitions and disposals primarily driven by the acquisition of miller insurance services in the first half of 2015 this growth was partially offset by a 42 percent negative impact from foreign currency translation 

organic commissions and fees growth of 10 percent was primarily due to growth in reinsurance and new business wins in willis capital markets  advisory 

willis north america reported 15 percent decline in commissions and fees compared to 2014 including organic growth of 24 percent partially offset by 35 percent negative impact from the disposal of nonstrategic low growth offices and a negative 04 percent impact from foreign currency translation 

willis international reported growth of 24 percent in commissions and fees compared with 2014 comprising 76 percent organic growth and 135 percent positive acquisitions impact largely from the acquisition of max matthiessen this was partially offset by an 187 percent negative impact from foreign currency translation 

willis towers watson plc 

organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in ‘review of segmental results’ below 

other income reported a decrease of 11 million compared with 2014 this decrease was due to a 15 million decrease in settlements partially offset by a 4 million increase in income from sales of us books of business 

salaries and benefits 

salaries and benefits were 2306 million or 03 percent lower in 2015 compared with 2014 and include a net 109 million increase from acquisitions and disposals offset by 148 million of favorable foreign currency movements the remaining increase of 31 million was driven by increased headcount pay reviews and higher incentives partially offset by lower benefits 

other expenses 

other operating expenses  were 140 million or 212 percent higher in 2015 compared with 2014 this growth included a net increase of 2 million in organic other operating costs a net 36 million increase from acquisitions and disposals a 70 million increase relating to litigation provisions and a 74 million increase in ma transactionrelated costs growth was partially offset by 42 million of favorable foreign currency movements

amortization of intangible assets  was 76 million in 2015 an increase of 22 million compared to 2014 the increase primarily reflects the increased charge relating to recent acquisitions including charles monat and max matthiessen partially offset by the ongoing reduction in the hrh acquisition amortization 

restructuring costs related to our operational improvement program were 126 million in 2015 compared with 36 million in 2014 this is discussed in further detail in the ‘operational improvement program’ section in the executive summary section above 

other income expense net 

other income expense net increased by 49 million compared to 2014 this increase was primarily due to a 59 million gain on the remeasurement of the previously equity accounted investment in gras savoye and increased gains on disposals of operations partially offset by an increase in the foreign currency loss in venezuela 

income taxes 

the tax rate for 2015 was 10 percent compared with 31 percent for 2014 the decrease in tax rate over the prior year is mainly attributable to the partial release of the valuation allowance in the us 

after adjusting for certain items as listed below the tax rate for 2015 was 22 percent 

   

management’s discussion and analysis 

interest in earnings of associates net of tax 

the majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of gras savoye the leading broker in france interest in earnings of associates net of tax in 2015 was 11 million compared with 14 million in 2014 following the acquisition of substantially all of the remaining share capital of gras savoye on december 29 2015 interest in earnings of associates from that date no longer includes earnings from gras savoye as we now consolidate gras savoye

the willis gb segment reported 05 percent decline in commissions and fees as negative 15 percent organic growth and 04

the majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of gras savoye the leading broker in france interest in earnings of associates net of tax in 2014 was 14 million compared to nil in 2013 the increase was primarily due to the nonrecurrence of charges relating to the 2013 reorganization program and other nonrecurring items with improved underlying financial performance in gras savoye 

management’s discussion and analysis 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

the merger with towers watson did not have any impact on legacy willis’ liquidity ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet needs for cash due to the shareforshare nature of the merger except for the acceleration of the dividend paid in december 2015 which would otherwise have been paid in january 2016 and the 400 million tranche drawn on january 4 2016 under the legacy willis 1year term loan facility which was used to refinance debt held by legacy towers watson which became due on acquisition

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the us and uk both of these plans are now closed to new entrants and with effect from may 15 2009 we closed our us defined benefit plan to future accrual new employees in the uk are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the us are offered the opportunity to join a 401k plan on june 30 2015 we implemented a salary freeze for our uk defined benefit pension plan we also have several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which we operate including a nonqualified plan in the us and an unfunded plan in the uk these smaller defined benefit plans have combined total assets of 342 million  and a combined net liability for pension benefits of 60 million  as of december 31 2015  elsewhere pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans 

we recorded a 75 million  and a 6 million  net periodic benefit income on our uk and us defined benefit pension schemes respectively in 2015  compared with a net periodic benefit income of 13 million on the uk scheme and a net periodic benefit income of 8 million on the us scheme in 2014  on our international defined benefit pension plans us nonqualified plan and uk unfunded plan we recorded a net periodic benefit cost of 3 million  in 2015  compared with 4 million  in 2014  

based on december 31 2015  assumptions as updated for the ‘spot rate’ approach to determining service cost and interest cost with effect from january 1 2016 we expect the net pension credit in 2016  will remain broadly flat for the uk plan despite the benefit from adopting the spot rate approach of approximately 12 million the net pension credit will increase by 2 million for the us plan despite the approximate 6 million benefit from adopting the spot rate approach and the net pension charge will remain unchanged at 3 million for the other plans 

we make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate the discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination our approach to determining appropriate assumptions for our uk and us pension plans is set out below

management’s discussion and analysis 

discount rate 

during 2015 we continued to use a durationbased approach which more closely matches the actual timing of expected cash flows to the applicable discount rate the selected rate used to discount uk plan liabilities in 2015 was 380  an increase of 20 basis points from the discount rate of 360  used at december 31 2014  during 2015 sterling highquality corporate bond yields rose slightly at almost all durations consequently the rate consistent with the expected maturity of the plan’s liabilities has also increased 

expected and actual asset returns 

expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations as part of the salary freeze negotiations with the scheme trustee we agreed to the trustee’s derisking strategy which will lead to a strategic target asset allocation with a greater weighting to fixed income assets consequently with effect from march 6 2015 the expected return on assets assumption was reduced by 50 basis points from 700 to 650 the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net uk pension expense was equivalent to an expected return in 2015  of 222 million  2014  213 million 

 there have been no further changes to the strategic target asset allocation therefore management considers that 650 continues to be an appropriate longterm rate of return assumption 

the expected and actual returns on uk plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2015  were as follows 



mortality 

the mortality assumption chosen should reflect the long term life expectancy of pension scheme members and represent the best estimate assumptions used as opposed to more prudent assumption used by pension scheme trustees for funding purposes 

at december 31 2014 the company updated the mortality assumption based on analysis carried out by the scheme actuary for the december 31 2013 funding valuation however to reflect scheme experience we adjusted the base tables such that there is no change in the overall strength of the assumption for 2015 we have continued with the same assumption and as a result the liabilities are unchanged 

as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a uk male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2015  would have a life expectancy of 24 years

willis towers watson plc 

discount rate 

the discount rate at december 31 2015  was 419  an increase of 29 basis points from the discount rate of 390  at december 31 2014  the increase in the discount rate reflects the modest increase in highquality corporate bond yields during 2015 

expected and actual asset returns 

the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net us pension scheme expense in 2015  was 725  2014 725 

the expected and actual returns on us plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2015  were as follows 



mortality 

at december 31 2015 the mortality table was changed from the rp2014 mortality table projected using mp2014 improvement scale on a fully generational basis which was used at december 31 2014 to the rp2014 mortality table rolled back to 2006 using mp2014 projected using towers watson bb2d adjusted improvement scale on a fully generational basis 

the impact of this change decreased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 55 million 

as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a us male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2015  would have a life expectancy of 20 years 

legacy willis goodwill impairment review 

we test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 

application of the impairment test involves the use of discounted cash flow models and requires significant judgment including 

 we use comparable market earnings multiple data and our company’s market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at october 1 at october 1 2015 our analysis showed the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was significantly in excess of carrying value and therefore did not result in an impairment charge  2014  nil 2013  nil 

legacy willis income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards we estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies 

management’s discussion and analysis 

at december 31 2015 we had gross deferred tax assets of 486 million 2014 426 million against which a valuation allowance of 187 million 2014 280 million had been recognized to the extent that 

 we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income 

considering our recent us earnings experience and projections of future income a possibility exists that we may release a portion of the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets in the next twelve months release of the us valuation allowance would result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded our us valuation allowance excluding that related to state separate taxes is 69 million as at december 31 2015 the exact timing and amount of future valuation release is subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability we are able to achieve 

positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities the benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 

the company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions in 2015 there was a net increase in unrecognized tax benefits of 3 million compared to a net decrease of 22 million in 2014 the company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

legacy willis commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice in certain cases where a range of loss exists we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount 

in addition the accounting standards require us to take into account a variety of factors with respect to loss contingencies as a result in the fourth quarter of 2015 we accrued 70 million before tax in connection with the litigation related to the stanford financial group we continue to dispute the allegations and to defend ourselves vigorously see part i item 3  ‘legal proceedings’ of this form 10k

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the information in this section is provided as of december 31 2015 and thus includes information on legacy willis only 

legacy willis financial risk management 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 — ‘basis of presentation and significant accounting policies’ of notes to the consolidated financial statements and further disclosure is provided in note 24 — ‘derivative financial instruments and hedging activities’ 

legacy willis foreign exchange risk 

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the united states we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling 

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2015 



our principal legacy willis exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from 

 london market operations 

the company’s primary foreign exchange risks in its london market operations arise from changes in the exchange rate between us dollars and pounds sterling as its london market operations earn the majority of their revenues in us dollars and incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling and may also hold a significant net sterling asset or liability position on the balance sheet in addition the london market operations earn significant revenues in euros and japanese yen 

the foreign exchange risks in its london market operations are hedged to the extent that 

market risk 

 however where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit we do not hedge the risk consequently if our london market operations have a significant pension asset or liability we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the us dollar and pounds sterling exchange rate changes we do however hedge the pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan 

translation risk 

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower 

with the exception of foreign currency hedges for certain intercompany loans that are not designated as hedging instruments we do not hedge translation risk 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within three years

willis towers watson plc 



 

 income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the united kingdom is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities 

legacy willis interest rate risk 

our operations are financed principally by 1906 million fixed rate senior notes issued by legacy willis maturing through 2043 shown gross of debt issuance costs and 240 million  under a 7 year term loan facility of the fixed rate senior notes 300 million are due 2016 394 million are due 2017 187 million are due 2019 500 million are due 2021 250 million are due 2023 and 275 million are due 2043 the 7year term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments and a final repayment of 186 million is due in the third quarter of 2018 

the company has access to i 800 million  under a revolving credit facility expiring july 23 2018 ii 400 million  under a revolving credit facility expiring april 28 2016 and a repayment date of april 28 2017 which will be available for regulatory capital purposes related to securities underwriting only and iii 22 million  under two  further revolving credit facilities of which 20 million  is also only available for specific regulatory purposes as of december 31 2015   467 million  2014  nil  was drawn on these facilities additionally the company has access to a 1year term loan in two tranches of €550 million   598 million  and 400 million  to be used for the specific purposes of the acquisitions of gras savoye and towers watson respectively as of december 31 2015  the equivalent of 592 million  was drawn on the €550 million  tranche and nil on the 400 million  tranche the interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown 

on december 31 2015 legacy willis consolidated 79 million  under a bank overdraft arrangement undertaken by gras savoye this borrowing had been entered into by gras savoye in the ordinary course of its insurance broking operations and was repaid on january 11 2016 

we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in both us dollars and pounds sterling 

as a result of our operating activities we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies we earn interest on these funds which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity 

during the year ended december 31 2015  the company in order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest the use of interest rate contracts essentially converted groups of shortterm variable rate investments to fixed rates these derivatives were designated as hedging instruments and were for a total notional amount of 300 million  

the table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for interest rate swaps the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts the duration of the interest rate swaps was three years with refixing periods of three months

 legacy willis liquidity risk 

our objective is to ensure we have the ability to generate sufficient cash either from internal or external sources in a timely and costeffective manner to meet our commitments as they fall due our management of liquidity risk is embedded within our overall risk management framework scenario analysis is continually undertaken to ensure that our resources can meet our liquidity requirements these resources are supplemented by access to 1222 million under four revolving credit facilities of which 355 million is available and undrawn for general corporate purposes we undertake shortterm foreign exchange swaps for liquidity purposes 

see ‘liquidity and capital resources’ section under item 7 ‘management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations’ 

legacy willis credit risk and concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the company currently does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties the company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents fiduciary funds accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value 

willis towers watson plc 

the company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure these financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the company does business as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the company’s concentrations of credit as of december 31 2015

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations 

we and our associates serve a diverse base of clients including major multinational and middlemarket companies in a variety of industries as well as public institutions and individual clients many of our client relationships span decades we have approximately 22100 employees around the world including approximately 3700 at our associate companies and a network of in excess of 400 offices in nearly 120 countries

competition 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two other major providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and marsh  mclennan and aon have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

willis group holdings plc 

regulation 

our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasigovernmental regulatory supervision in all countries in which we operate also such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities while these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria our three most significant regulatory regions are described below 

united states 

our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the united states are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state insurance laws in the united states are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the states in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these states 

european union 

in 2005 the european union insurance mediation directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the european union on a basis consistent with the eu single market and customer protection aims each eu member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence good repute professional indemnity cover and financial capacity 

united kingdom 

in the united kingdom our business is regulated by the financial conduct auditory fca the fca has a wide range of rulemaking investigatory and enforcement powers and conducts monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements 

the fca has a sole strategic objective to protect and enhance confidence in the uk financial system its operational objectives are to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers promote efficiency and choice in the market for financial services and protect and enhance the integrity of the uk financial system the fca also has a duty to act in a way that promotes competition and to minimize the extent to which regulated businesses may be used for a purpose connected with financial crime finally the fca has new powers in product intervention for instance it can instruct firms to withdraw or amend misleading financial promotions 

other 

certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment and securities licensing authorities in the united states our willis capital markets  advisory business operates through our whollyowned subsidiary willis securities inc a usregistered brokerdealer and member finrasipc primarily in connection with investment bankingrelated services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions willis capital markets provides advice on securities or investments in the european union and australia through our uk whollyowned subsidiary willis capital markets  advisory limited which is authorized and regulated by the fca willis capital markets through our hong kong whollyowned subsidiary willis capital markets  advisory hong kong limited is in the process of obtaining securities and advisory licenses through and will be regulated by the hong kong securities and futures commission 

our failure or that of our employees to satisfy the regulators that we comply with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities can result in disciplinary action fines reputational damage and financial harm 

all companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the united states and united kingdom we do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position 

see part i item 1arisk factors ‘legal and regulatory risks’ for discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business

 item   1a   risk factors 

risks relating to our business and the insurance industry 

this section describes material risks affecting the group’s business these risks could materially affect the group’s business reputation revenues operating income net income net assets liquidity and capital resources and ability to achieve its financial targets and accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k 

competitive risks 

worldwide economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our business and operating results are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions current global economic conditions including those associated with the eurozone coupled with low customer and business confidence may have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from these conditions since 2008 many of our operations have been impacted by the weakened economic climate a significant number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business in addition an increase in mergers and acquisitions can also result in the loss of clients while it is difficult to predict the consequences of any further deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the potential for a significant insurer to fail be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients 

the credit and economic conditions of certain european union countries remain fragile and may contribute to instability in the global credit and financial markets if credit conditions worsen or financial market volatility increases in the eurozone it is possible that it could have a negative effect on the global economy as a whole and our business operating results and financial condition if the eurozone continues to deteriorate there will likely be a negative effect on our european business as well as the businesses of our european clients further were the euro to be withdrawn entirely or the eurozone were to be dissolved as a common currency area the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time a significant devaluation of the euro would cause the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros to be significantly reduced any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits of our growth strategy 

we have stated certain goals at our 2013 investor conference and our outlook for 2015 in order to achieve these goals we are implementing certain revenue growth strategies and continue to strive to manage our cost base for example we announced a series of actions that include among other things our multiyear operational improvement program and initiatives to better connect willis in light of the potential operational risks associated with these new initiatives we cannot be certain whether we will be able to realize benefits from current revenuegenerating or costsaving initiatives and ultimately realize our objectives there can be no assurance that our actual results will meet these financial goals 

we do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in the premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission levels may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a soft or softening market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin a hard or firming market during which premium rates rise generally has a 

risk factors 

favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin rates however vary by geography industry and client segment we have been and continue to be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions in addition insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as ourselves the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

competition in our industry is intense and if we are unable to compete effectively we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two major global providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and marsh  mclennan and aon have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of nontraditional market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services if we are unable to compete effectively we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

the loss of our chief executive officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives 

the loss of our chief executive officer a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our chief executive officer dominic casserley and other members of our senior management but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships the insurance and reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand train and manage our employee base we may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense 

we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses and lack of control over investments in associates 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we may acquire or dispose of or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments for example we have a call option to acquire 100 percent of the capital of our associate gras savoye the success of our overall acquisition and disposition strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate opportunities negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions once we complete acquisitions or reorganizations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction including revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies for example if we fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from a transaction goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired in future periods 

in addition we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies which may impact our results of operations if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce the overheads related to the divested assets 

we also own an interest in a number of associates where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore limited in our ability to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we can achieve if we had full ownership 

investment in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment 

from time to time we may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there can be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts including the investment of significant time and resources the possibility that these efforts will be unprofitable and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and new products 

willis group holdings plc 

and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results for operations external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business in addition we can provide no assurance that the entry into new lines of business or development of new products and services will be successful 

we are continually developing and investing in new and innovative offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the market nevertheless the ability of these efforts to produce meaningful value is dependent on a number of other factors some of which are outside of our control for example we have invested substantial time and resources in launching the willis advantage under the belief that this exchange will serve a useful role to help corporations and individuals in the united states manage their growing health care expenses but in order for the willis advantage to be successful health care insurers and corporate and individual participants must deem it suitable to participate in and such decisions are based on their own particular circumstances 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology to drive value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely and costeffective manner and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant cost our competitors are seeking to develop competing technologies and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements 

legal and regulatory risks 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we comply with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states the united kingdom the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions around the world in which we operate in addition we own an interest in a number of associates where we do not exercise management control over the last few years regulators across the world are increasingly seeking to regulate brokers who operate in their jurisdictions compliance with laws and regulations that apply to our operations is complex and increases our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations economic and trade sanctions and laws against financial crimes including client money and antimoney laundering bribery or other corruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act anticompetition and data privacy legislation in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies monetary fines injunctions revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients while we believe that we have substantially increased our focus on the geographic breadth of regulations to which we are subject maintain good relationships with our key regulators and our current systems and controls are adequate we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of any applicable laws and regulations 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist our clients with matters including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims involving substantial amounts of money errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question 

claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include allegations of damages for our employees or subagents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis 

risk factors 

errors and omissions claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly in recent years in respect of selfinsured risks we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience 

we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims an example of material claims for which we are subject that are outside of the error and omissions claims context relate to those arising out of the collapse of the stanford financial group for which we acted as brokers of record on certain lines of insurance 

the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may also be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships 

accepting market derived income mdi may cause regulatory or other scrutiny which may have a material and adverse effect on our business 

insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by commission or fees paid by clients intermediaries also obtain revenue from insurance carriers this is commonly known as market derived income or mdi mdi takes a variety of forms including volume or profitbased contingent commissions facilities administration charges business development agreements and fees for providing certain data to carriers 

mdi creates various risks intermediaries have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ interests ahead of their clients accordingly mdi may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest antitrust unfair competition and antibribery laws and regulations while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice and while we have established systems and controls to manage these risks we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny 

it and operational risks 

data security breaches or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards as well as improper or inadvertent staff behavior could expose confidential company and personal data systems to security breaches additionally one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs 

with respect to our commercial arrangements with thirdparty vendors we have processes designed to require thirdparty it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyberattack on a vendor’s information systems 

we have experienced a number of data incidents resulting from human error as well as attempts at unauthorized access to our systems which to date have not had a material impact on our business operations or clients

further data privacy information security identity theft and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements and customer expectations in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing hardware or systems could cause material financial loss regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards and to be at the forefront of a range of technology relevant to our business 

if the data we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer hardware applications or software systems or if we experience other disruptions this could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a natural disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located this may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business although we have business continuity and disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies such procedures may not be entirely effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a natural disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

certain of our businesses pose underwriting advisory or reputational risks and can have a significant adverse impact on our financial results 

we provide a broad range of brokerage reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide in addition our willis capital markets  advisory business provides advice to insurance and reinsurance companies on a broad array of merger and acquisition transactions as well as capital markets products including acting as underwriter or agent for primary issuances operating a secondary insurancelinked securities trading desk and engaging in general capital markets and strategic advisory work these operations may pose certain underwriting advisory or reputational risks to our business 

financial risks 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility 

we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 23 billion  as of december 31 2014 and our 2014  interest expense was 135 million  although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may 

require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures to pursue other acquisitions or investments to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes 

 18 

risk factors 

 the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments 

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our pension liabilities may increase which could require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans reducing the cash available for other uses 

we have two principal defined benefit plans one in the united kingdom and the other in the united states and in addition we have several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which we operate 

in 2012 we agreed a revised funding strategy with the uk plans trustee under which we are committed to make additional cash contributions in the event that our adjusted ebitda exceeds certain thresholds or we make exceptional returns for our shareholders including share buybacks or special dividends as a result we may be committed to make additional contributions through to 2017 based on the prior years performance during 2015 we will be required to negotiate a new funding arrangement which may change the contributions we are required to make during 2015 and beyond 

total cash contributions excluding employees’ salary sacrifice contributions to these defined benefit pension plans in 2014 were 112 million in 2015 the company currently expects to make cash contributions of approximately 116 million including exceptional returns to these pension plans although we may elect to contribute more future estimates are based on certain assumptions including discount rates interest rates mortality fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets 

we have taken actions to manage our pension liabilities including closing our uk and us plans to new participants and restricting final pensionable salaries future benefit accruals in the us pension plan were also stopped or frozen on may 15 2009 nevertheless the determination of pension expense and pension funding is based on a variety of rules and regulations changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets they may also result in higher pension costs additional financial statement disclosure and accelerate and increase the need to fully fund our pension plans through increased cash contributions further a significant decline in the value of investments that fund our pension plan if not offset or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities may significantly alter the values and actuarial assumptions used to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required to fund our plan with significant additional amounts of cash in addition to the critical assumptions described above our plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan participants and surviving spouses periodic revision of those assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pension expense changes in our pension benefit obligations the related net periodic costs or credits and the required level of future cash contributions may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees the need to make additional cash contributions may reduce our financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or other needs of our business 

we could incur substantial losses including with respect to our own cash and fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies and clients if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations failed 

we maintain significant cash balances at various us depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the us federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits we also maintain significant cash balances in foreign financial institutions a significant portion of this cash is fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies or clients if one or more of the institutions in which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses we would also be liable to claims made by the insurance companies or our clients regarding the fiduciary cash held on their behalf 

willis group holdings plc 

a downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility and under certain circumstances may require us to offer to buy back some of our outstanding debt 

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility in addition certain downgrades would trigger a stepup in interest rates under the indentures for our 6200 senior notes due 2017 and our 7000 senior notes due 2019 which would increase our interest expense if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources this may in turn impact the assumptions when performing our goodwill impairment testing which may reduce the excess of fair value over carrying value of the reporting units 

in addition under the indenture for our 4625 senior notes due 2023 and our 6125 senior notes due 2043 if we experience a ratings decline together with a change of control event we would be required to offer to purchase our 4625 senior notes due 2023 and our 6125 senior notes due 2043 from holders unless we had previously redeemed those notes we may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

willis group holdings is a holding company that conducts no business of its own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries for example willis limited our uk brokerage subsidiary regulated by the fca is currently required to maintain 126 million in unencumbered and available funds of which at least 79 million must be in cash for regulatory purposes in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and make other payments to willis group holdings we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on ordinary shares 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit notwithstanding the fact that we recognized an impairment charge in fiscal year 2012 for our north american reporting unit the risk remains that a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

for further information on our testing for goodwill impairment see ‘critical accounting estimates’ under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

international risks 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the united states accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside the united states and our london market operations we 

risk factors 

predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency the table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2014 



because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses together with any net sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollar denominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure 

for example as the pound sterling strengthens the us dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase which then causes our results to be negatively impacted however any net sterling asset we are holding will be more valuable when translated into us dollars given these facts the strength of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results this risk could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flow and results of operations in the future 

additionally as at december 31 2014 we are using the sicad i rate of approximately 12 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar to report our venezuelan financial position following devaluation from the official rate of approximately six bolivars per us dollar we cannot predict whether there will be a further devaluation of the venezuelan currency or whether the use of the sicad i rate will continue to be supported as at december 31 2014 we have approximately 22 million of net monetary assets that are denominated in the venezuela bolivar 

where needed we deploy a hedging strategy to mitigate part of our operating exposure to exchange rate movements but such mitigating attempts may not be successful for more information on this strategy see part ii item 8  note 24 derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries 

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets the possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses these risks include

willis group holdings plc 

 legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us and our effective tax rate may increase 

there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate which include the potential legislative actions described below and our tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate for example legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which we rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions including the united states we could be subjected to increased taxation in addition any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased taxation 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not be directly enforceable in ireland while not directly enforceable it is possible for a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability to be enforced in ireland through common law rules however this process is subject to numerous established principles and would involve the commencement of a new set of proceedings in ireland to enforce the judgment 

as an irish company willis group holdings is currently governed by the irish companies acts 19632013 in late 2014 a new companies act the “2014 act” was passed by both houses of the irish parliament and is expected to apply to all companies including willis group holdings from june 1 2015 in addition to introducing new provisions the 2014 act carries over many of the existing rules applicable to irish companies which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise under the current regime and the 2014 act the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of willis group holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states

 item 3 — legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance similar to other corporations the company is also subject to a variety of other claims including those relating to the company’s employment practices some of the claims lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could if assessed be significant 

errors and omissions claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly in recent years regarding selfinsured risks the company has established provisions which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and the company adjusts such provisions from time to time according to developments 

on the basis of current information the company does not expect that the actual claims lawsuits and other proceedings to which the company is subject or potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity nonetheless given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and 

willis group holdings plc 

disputes with insurance companies it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could from time to time have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 

the material actual or potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings of which the company is currently aware are as follows 

stanford financial group litigation 

the company has been named as a defendant in 13 similar lawsuits relating to the collapse of the stanford financial group ‘stanford’ for which willis of colorado inc acted as broker of record on certain lines of insurance the complaints in these actions generally allege that the defendants actively and materially aided stanford’s alleged fraud by providing stanford with certain letters regarding coverage that they knew would be used to help retain or attract actual or prospective stanford client investors the complaints further allege that these letters which contain statements about stanford and the insurance policies that the defendants placed for stanford contained untruths and omitted material facts and were drafted in this manner to help stanford promote and sell its allegedly fraudulent certificates of deposit 

the 13 actions are as follows

share data and dividends 

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the united states should be exempt from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from irish dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends 

with respect to noncorporate us shareholders certain dividends from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states such as our shares noncorporate us shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as ‘investment income’ pursuant to section 163d4 of the code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation in addition the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances

this discussion includes references to nongaap financial measures as defined in regulation g of the rules of the securities and exchange commission ‘sec’ we present such nongaap financial measures specifically underlying and organic nongaap financial measures as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the company’s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future 

underlying total revenues underlying total expenses underlying salaries and benefits underlying other operating expenses underlying operating income underlying operating margin underlying ebitda underlying net income and underlying earnings per diluted share hereinafter referred to collectively as the underlying measures are calculated by excluding the impact of certain items and period over period movements in foreign currency from the most directly comparable gaap measures 

organic commissions and fees total revenues organic total expenses organic salaries and benefits organic other operating expenses organic operating income organic operating margin and organic ebitda hereinafter referred to collectively as the organic measures further adjust underlying measures to exclude the twelve month impact from acquisitions and disposals from the most directly comparable gaap measures 

our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited these financial measures   should be viewed in addition to not in lieu of the consolidated financial   statements for the year ended december 31 2014

executive summary 

business overview 

we provide a broad range of insurance broking risk management and consulting services to our clients worldwide and during the period organized our business into three segments global north america and international 

for additional information regarding our business see the more detailed discussion under part i item 1  business of this form 10k 

market conditions 

due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin a ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin rates however vary by geography industry and client segment as a result and due to the global and diverse nature of our business we view rates in the aggregate 

market conditions in our industry are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world insurance rate movements and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients 

early in 2013 the reinsurance market was generally flat however as the year progressed we saw changing market sentiment driven by changes in the sources of capital and increases in capital supply in the reinsurance market most notably within the north american catastropheexposed property market the influx of thirdparty capital coupled with changes to reinsurance buying patterns and regulatory complexity is leading to growing complexity in the reinsurance market and a softening of prices 

business discussion 

in 2014 we noted a continuation of this trend and signs of acceleration towards softening reinsurance rates across almost all classes of business and geographies as positive 2013 results for traditional reinsurers exacerbated the growing supply of capital from thirdparty investors in addition for primary insurance companies the ability to recognize primary rate increases may be coming to an end and consequently rate flattening and even rate reductions are seen in many territories on primary insurance classes 

in the face of this challenging environment we have adopted a strategy to 1 invest selectively in growth areas defined by geography industry sector and client segment and 2 better coordinate our business so as to bring our clients greater access to the companys specialty areas and analytical capabilities among other things our growth strategy also involves increasing our investment in and deployment of our analytical capabilities 

financial performance 

the following is a summary of our 2014 gaap financial results 

 our nongaap financial measures were as follows 

 

operational improvement program 

in april 2014 the company announced an operational improvement program that would allow the company to continue to strengthen its client service realize operational efficiencies and invest in new capabilities for growth 

willis group holdings plc 

the main elements of the program include the following 

 the program began in the second quarter of 2014 and is expected to be complete by the end of 2017 the program is expecting to deliver cumulative cost savings of at least 420 million through 2017 and annual cost savings of approximately 300 million starting in 2018 

actual cost savings of approximately 11 million were achieved in 2014 the estimated phasing of future cost savings is as follows at least 60 million in 2015 approximately 135 million in 2016 and approximately 235 million in 2017 the estimated cost savings are before any potential reinvestment for future growth 

to achieve these savings the company expects to incur cumulative spend including capital expenditure amounting to approximately 410 million through the end of 2017 program spend in 2014 was 36 million with approximately 130 million expected for 2015 and the balance of approximately 240 million expected to be incurred in 2016 and 2017 

total spend actual savings and timing may vary positively or negatively from these estimates due to changes in the scope underlying assumptions or execution risk of the restructuring plan throughout its duration 

the company expects that about 70 percent of the annualized 2018 savings would come from role relocation and reduction and about 30 percent of the savings from real estate information technology and other areas

nongaap financial measures 

during 2014 we made changes to the nongaap financial measures that we use to provide additional meaningful methods of evaluating the company’s operating performance replacing our adjusted measures with new underlying measures and introduced new organic nongaap financial measures 

previously we excluded certain specified items from total expenses salaries and benefits other operating expenses operating margin operating income net income loss and earnings per share to calculate adjusted total expenses adjusted salaries and benefits adjusted other operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted operating income adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share 

in addition to these certain specified items we exclude the periodoverperiod foreign currency movements to calculate our underlying nongaap financial measures and further exclude the twelve month impact from acquisitions and disposals to calculate our organic nongaap financial measures 

we believe that the understanding of the companys performance and comparative analysis of our results is enhanced by our disclosure of the following nongaap financial measures we use these and other measures to establish group performance targets and evaluate the performance of our operations 

our method for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited

revenues 

total revenues by segment for 2014  and 2013  are shown below millions except percentages 



 

 

total revenues of 3802 million  increased by 147 million  or 40 percent  in 2014  compared to 2013  this was primarily due to 37 percent  growth in commissions and fees 

total commissions and fees in 2014  were 3767 million  up 134 million  or 37 percent  from 3633 million  in 2013  this increase was comprised of organic growth of 134 million or 38 percent  and growth through acquisitions and disposals of 28 million or 08 percent  partially offset by negative foreign currency movements of 30 million or 09 percent  

the foreign currency impact was as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar against a number of currencies that our commissions and fees are earned in most significantly the euro australian dollar and brazilian real partially offset by the yearonyear weakening of the us dollar against the pound sterling 

the global segment reported 21 percent  growth in commissions and fees comprising 14 percent  organic growth and a 09 percent  positive impact from foreign currency translation this growth was partially offset by a net 02 percent  decline from acquisitions and disposals primarily due to a disposal in third quarter 2013 

organic commissions and fees growth of 14 percent  was driven by strong new business growth and higher client retention levels compared with the year ago period partially offset by the negative impact from declining insurance and reinsurance rates and significant construction projects in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 

the north america segment reported 12 percent  growth in commissions and fees compared to 2013  including organic growth of 28 percent  partially offset by 15 percent  negative impact from the disposal of nonstrategic low growth offices and a negative 01 percent  impact from foreign currency translation 

the international segment reported 97 percent  growth in commissions and fees compared with 2013  comprising 90 percent  organic growth and 58 percent  positive impact from the acquisitions of max matthiessen and charles monat this was partially offset by a 51 percent  negative impact from foreign currency translation 

organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in review of segmental results below 

other income reported an increase of 12 million  compared to 2013  this increase was primarily due to a 12 million settlement related to a specialty book of business within the global segment 

salaries and benefits 

salaries and benefits were  107 million  or 48 percent  higher in 2014  compared with 2013  and includes a net 20 million increase from acquisitions and disposals 3 million of adverse foreign currency movements and 29 million benefit from the 

business discussion 

nonrecurrence of 2013 expense reduction initiative costs the remaining increase of 113 million was driven by increased headcount pay reviews and higher incentives 

other expenses 

other operating expenses  were  23 million  or 36 percent  higher in 2014  compared with 2013  this growth included a net 9 million increase from acquisitions and disposals 2 million of adverse foreign currency movements 12 million benefit from the nonrecurrence of 2013 expense reduction initiative costs and marketing costs the remaining increase of 25 million was primarily due to higher travel accommodation and entertainment expenses along with increased systems costs 

depreciation expense  was 92 million  in 2014  compared with 94 million  in 2013  the decrease of 2 million  included 5 million benefit from nonrecurrence of 2013 expense reduction initiative costs offset by 1 million of adverse foreign currency movements 

amortization of intangible assets  was 54 million  in 2014  a reduction of 1 million  compared to 2013  the decrease primarily reflects the ongoing reduction in the hrh acquisition amortization partially offset by the increased charge relating to the acquisition of charles monat and max matthiessen 

restructuring costs related to our operational improvement program were 36 million in 2014  compared with nil in 2013  this is discussed in further detail in the operational improvement program section in the executive summary section above 

income taxes 

the tax rate for 2014 was 31 percent compared with 24 percent for 2013 both years were impacted by certain items and the continuing requirement to retain a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets the increase in tax rate over the prior year is partly attributable to the us returning to a tax paying position for the 2014 tax year 

after adjusting for certain items as listed below the tax rate for 2014 was 25 percent 

 

  interest in earnings of associates net of tax 

the majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of gras savoye the leading broker in france interest in earnings of associates net of tax in 2014  was 14 million  compared to  nil  in 2013  the increase was primarily due to the nonrecurrence of charges relating to the 2013 reorganization program and other nonrecurring items with improved underlying financial performance in gras savoye

total revenues increased by 175 million  or 50 percent  in 2013  compared to 2012  this was primarily due to 49 percent  growth in organic commissions and fees partially offset by a 03 percent  negative impact from foreign exchange and a 3 million  decrease in investment income due to continued falling yields on deposits 

total commissions and fees in 2013  were 3633 million  up 175 million  or 51 percent  from 3458 million  in 2012  this increase was due to organic growth of 49 percent  and growth through acquisitions and disposals of 05 percent partially offset by negative foreign currency movements of 13 million or 03 percent  

organic growth of 49 percent  was driven by low doubledigit new business growth tempered by lost business 

commissions and fees were reduced by a net 9 million impact of two revenue recognition adjustments in the north america and international segments discussed below 

the global segment reported 42 percent  growth in commissions and fees comprising 43 percent  organic growth a 08 percent  positive impact from acquisitions and disposals and a 09 percent  negative impact from foreign currency translation organic commissions and fees growth of 43 percent  was led by high singledigit growth in reinsurance where all the divisions reported positive growth global specialties reported mid singledigit growth primarily due to strong growth from financial and executive risk and pc and construction 

the north america segment reported a 53 percent  growth in organic commissions and fees compared to 2012  comprising 48 percent  organic commissions and fees growth a 06 percent  positive impact from acquisition of avalon actuarial inc and a 01 percent  negative impact from foreign currency translation organic growth in commissions and fees was positively impacted by a 5 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in the north america personal lines business with the rest of the group 

the international segment reported 59 percent  growth in commissions and fees compared with 2012 comprising 58 percent  organic commissions and fees growth and a 01 percent  positive impact from foreign currency translation organic growth in commissions and fees included the negative impact of a 15 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in china with the rest of the group

the remaining 24 million increase was primarily due to higher business development costs consulting and professional fees to assist us in our growth initiatives and marketing costs 

depreciation expense  was 94 million  in 2013  compared with 79 million  in 2012  the increase of 15 million includes 5 million which was incurred in first quarter 2013 relating to the rationalization of property and systems as part of our expense reduction initiative the remaining 10 million increase is primarily due to a number of significant information technology related projects becoming operational during the year and the writeoff of replaced systems and other assets 

amortization of intangible assets  was 55 million  in 2013  a reduction of 4 million compared to 2012  the decrease primarily reflects the ongoing reduction in the hrh acquisition amortization

the majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of gras savoye the leading broker in france interest in earnings of associates net of tax in 2013  was  nil  compared to 5 million  in 2012  the decline was mainly driven by lower net income recorded in gras savoye due to the costs recognized in relation to a reorganization program undertaken in the year designed to drive growth in revenues and operational efficiencies

the 14 percent  organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth and higher client retention levels compared with the year ago period partially offset by the negative impact of rates and the nonrecurrence of significant construction projects in 2013 

the 02 percent  decline from acquisitions and disposals was related to the disposal of a small commercial business from the uk retail division in fourth quarter 2013 partially offset by the acquisition of prime professions in second quarter 2013 

business discussion 

willis re reported mid singledigit organic commissions and fees growth with its north america business leading the way with high singledigit results new business was strong across all three divisions and we reported increased client retention levels compared to the prior year growth however was tempered by the negative impact of premium rate movements 

willis insurance uk reported a low singledigit decline primarily due to poor performance in the insolvency and willis commercial network businesses the nonrecurrence of large construction projects in 2013 in the construction property  casualty business and the negative impact from the acquisitions and disposals noted above 

willis capital markets  advisory performed solidly in the year and reported significant growth on last year as a result of significant new business wins

the 45 million growth in expenses was due to higher salaries and benefits as a result of the increase in headcount relative to the prior year annual salary reviews and higher incentives which were linked to commissions and fees performance this increase was offset by the decline in other operating expenses primarily due to lower allocation of corporate costs and an eo provision release partially offset by a legal claim settlement and higher systems and premises costs 

in addition the yearonyear growth included 11 million restructuring costs relating the operational improvement program 

operating margin 

full year operating margin was 250 percent  in 2014  and 276 percent  in 2013  the decline was driven by expense growth of 71 percent  exceeding the 34 percent  total revenue growth

2014  compared to 2013   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1365 million  were 16 million  or 12 percent  higher in 2014  compared with 2013  

this increase was primarily due to organic growth of 28 percent  partially offset by a 15 percent  negative impact from acquisitions and disposals and a 01 percent  negative impact from foreign currency movements 

the acquisitions and disposals impact was primarily due to the disposal of nonstrategic low growth offices in the second and fourth quarters of 2014 partially offset by the acquisition of the employee benefits consulting division of capital strategies in fourth quarter 2013 

the 28 percent  organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth compared with the year ago period partially offset by lost business and the nonrecurrence of a positive 5 million adjustment in 2013 to align the recognition of revenue in the north america personal lines business with the rest of the group rates had a small negative impact on the full years commissions and fees 

growth was achieved across most of our north america regions led by the south atlantic and northeast regions as a result of new business growth 

similarly most of the major practice groups recorded positive growth our two largest practices human capital and construction recorded mid single and low singledigit growth respectively in our other practices we recorded doubledigit growth in mergers  acquisitions financial  executive risks and service industry 

client retention levels were 920 percent  in 2014  compared with 921 percent  in 2013  

business discussion 

expenses 

total operating expenses of 1097 million  were 12 million  or 11 percent  lower for 2014  compared to 2013  

the 12 million reduction in expenses was due to lower incentives as a result of oneoff adjustments reduction to the amortization of intangible assets and the disposal of certain nonstrategic low growth locations partially offset by higher salaries due to annual salary reviews and higher business development expenses 

in addition full year 2014 operating expenses included 3 million restructuring costs relating to the operational improvement program 

operating margin 

operating margin in north america was 199 percent  in 2014  compared with 183 percent  in 2013  driven by solid commissions and fees growth 

2013  compared to 2012   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1349 million  were 68 million  or 53 percent  higher in 2013  compared with 2012  

this increase was primarily due to organic growth of 48 percent  in 2013  compared with 2012  and a 06 percent  positive impact from the acquisition of avalon actuarial inc in fourth quarter 2012 partially offset by a 01 percent  negative impact from foreign currency movements 

commissions and fees included a positive 5 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in the north america personal lines business with the rest of the group 

the 48 percent  organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth and higher client retention levels compared with the year ago period partially offset by lost business rates had a small positive impact on the full years commissions and fees 

growth was achieved across all our north america regions led by the metro midwest canada and cappps regions this was attributed to new business growth as well as increased client retention rates in almost all regions 

similarly most of the major practice groups recorded positive growth our two largest practices human capital and construction recorded mid singledigit growth and in our other practices we recorded high singledigit growth in real estate and low singledigit growth in financial  executive risks healthcare and manufacturing 

operating margin 

operating margin in north america was 183 percent  in 2013  compared with 196 percent  in 2012  solid commissions and fees growth was outpaced by increased expenses driven by higher salaries and benefits most notably as a result of annual salary reviews salary and benefits were also impacted by a higher incentives charge as a result of higher commissions and fees and the change in remuneration policy and additional 401k match and medical charges partially offset by lower charges for sharebased compensation and pensions

organic commissions and fees growth was 90 percent  and there was a 58 percent  positive impact from the acquisition of charles monat in second quarter 2014 and max matthiessen in fourth quarter 2014 this was partially offset by a 51 percent  negative impact from foreign currency movements which was driven by the weakening of a basket of currencies versus the us dollar 

organic growth included doubledigit new business growth and a positive impact from rates partly offset by lost business growth was positively impacted by the nonrecurrence of an adjustment recorded in 2013 to align the recognition of revenue in china with the rest of the group 

western europe reported mid singledigit growth driven by iberia germany and ireland 

latin america reported doubledigit growth arising primarily from brazil and venezuela which was partially offset by decline in colombia

business discussion 

critical accounting estimates 

our accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance 

 management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our audit committee 

pension expense 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the us and uk both of these plans are now closed to new entrants and with effect from may 15 2009 we closed our us defined benefit plan to future accrual new employees in the uk are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the us are offered the opportunity to join a 401k plan we also have smaller defined benefit plans in ireland germany norway and the netherlands a nonqualified plan in the us and an unfunded plan in the uk these smaller defined benefit plans have combined total assets of 171 million  and a combined net liability for pension benefits of 39 million  as of december 31 2014  elsewhere pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans 

we recorded a 13 million  and an 8 million  net periodic benefit income on our uk and us defined benefit pension schemes respectively in 2014  compared with a net periodic benefit income of 5 million on the uk scheme and a net periodic benefit income of 4 million on the us scheme in 2013  on our international defined benefit pension plans us nonqualified plan and uk unfunded plan we recorded a net periodic benefit cost of 4 million  in 2014  compared with 5 million  in 2013  

based on december 31 2014  assumptions we expect the net pension credit in 2015  will increase 31 million for the uk plan the net pension credit will decrease by 2 million for the us plan and the net pension charge will remain unchanged at 4 million for the other plans 

we make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate the discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination our approach to determining appropriate assumptions for our uk and us pension plans is set out below 

uk plan

willis group holdings plc 

discount rate 

during 2014 we continued to use a durationbased approach which more closely matches the actual timing of expected cash flows to the applicable discount rate the selected rate used to discount uk plan liabilities in 2014 was 360  a decrease of 80 basis points from the discount rate of 440  used at december 31 2013  during 2014 sterling highquality corporate bond yields fell significantly at all durations consequently the rate consistent with the expected maturity of the plans liabilities has also decreased 

expected and actual asset returns 

expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net uk pension expense in 2014  was 700   2013  725  equivalent to an expected return in 2014  of 213 million  2013  191 million there have been no further changes to the strategic target asset allocation therefore management considers that 700 continues to be an appropriate longterm rate of return assumption 

the expected and actual returns on uk plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2014  were as follows 



mortality 

the mortality assumption chosen should reflect the long term life expectancy of pension scheme members and represent the best estimate assumptions used as opposed to more prudent assumption used by pension scheme trustees for funding purposes 

at december 31 2014 we have updated the mortality base tables to use the more recent 8098 s1na tables for male and females however we have adjusted the base tables to reflect our scheme experiences and consequently the liabilities are broadly unchanged 

as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a uk male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2014  would have a life expectancy of 24 years 

us plan 



 

 discount rate 

the discount rate at december 31 2014  was 390  an decrease of 86 basis points from the discount rate of 476  at december 31 2013  the decrease in the discount rate reflects the decrease in highquality corporate bond yields during 2014 

the impact of the lower discount rate in 2014  increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 103 million 

business discussion 

expected and actual asset returns 

the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net us pension scheme expense in 2014  was 725  2013 725 

the expected and actual returns on us plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2014  were as follows 



mortality 

during 2014 the us society of actuaries released updated mortality tables to reflect improvements in longevity reflecting the results of their multiyear mortality study of participants in uninsured pension plans in the us they also published details of mortality improvements in summary these tables showed that people are living longer especially at older ages 

consequently in line with market practice we have adopted at december 31 2014 the rp 2014 mortality table projected using mp2014 improvements scale on a fully generational basis december 31 2013 rp2000 mortality table blended for annuitants and nonannuitants projected by scale aa to 2021 for annuitants and 2029 for nonannuitants 

the impact of this change increase the projected benefit obligation by approximately 80 million 

as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a us male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2014  would have a life expectancy of 22 years 

goodwill impairment review 

we test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 

application of the impairment test involves the use of discounted cash flow models and requires significant judgment including 

 we use comparable market earnings multiple data and our companys market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at october 1 at october 1 2014 our analysis showed the estimate fair value of each reporting unit was significantly in excess of carrying value and therefore did not result in an impairment charge  2013  nil 2012  492 million 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards we estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies 

willis group holdings plc 

at december 31 2014  we had gross deferred tax assets of 426 million   2013  383 million  against which a valuation allowance of 280 million   2013  196 million  had been recognized to the extent that 

 we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income 

considering our recent us earnings experience and projections of future income a possibility exists that we may release a portion of the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets in the next twelve months release of the us valuation allowance would result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded our us valuation allowance excluding that related to state separate taxes is 160 million as at december 31 2014 the exact timing and amount of future valuation release is subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability we are able to achieve 

positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities the benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 

the company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions in 2014  there was a net decrease in uncertain tax positions of 22 million  compared to a net increase of 4 million  in 2013  the company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

financial risk management 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 — basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements and further disclosure is provided in note 24 — derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

foreign exchange risk management 

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the united states we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling 

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2014  



our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from 

 london market operations 

in our london market operations we earn revenue in a number of different currencies principally us dollars pounds sterling euros and japanese yen but incur expenses almost entirely in pounds sterling 

we hedge this risk as follows 

 65 

willis group holdings plc 

 however where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit we do not hedge the risk consequently if our london market operations have a significant pension asset or liability we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the us dollar and pounds sterling exchange rate changes we do however hedge the pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan 

translation risk 

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower 

with the exception of foreign currency hedges for certain intercompany loans that are not designated as hedging instruments we do not hedge translation risk 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within three years 





 

 income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the united kingdom is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities 

market risk 

interest rate risk management 

our operations are financed principally by 2054 million fixed rate senior notes issued by the group and 259 million under a 7year term loan facility of the fixed rate senior notes 148 million are due 2015 300 million are due 2016 394 million are due 2017 187 million are due 2019 500 million are due 2021 250 million are due 2023 and 275 million are due 2043 the 7year term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments and a final repayment of 186 million is due in the second quarter of 2018 as of december 31 2014  we had access to 1122 million under four revolving credit facilities of which 798 million is available for general corporate purposes and as at this date no amount was outstanding under those facilities the interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown 

we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in both us dollars and pounds sterling 

as a result of our operating activities we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies we earn interest on these funds which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity in order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets we entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest in the various currencies related to the shortterm investments the use of interest rate contracts essentially converted groups of shortterm variable rate investments to fixed rates however in the fourth quarter of 2011 we stopped renewing hedged positions on their maturity given the flat yield curve environment further to this during second quarter 2012 the company closed out its legacy position for these interest rate swap contracts 

during the year ended december 31 2010 the company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of 350 million to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semiannual basis with a maturity date of july 15 2015 the company had previously designated these instruments as fair value hedges against its 350 million 5625 senior notes due 2015 and had accounted for them accordingly until the first quarter of 2013 at which point these swaps although remaining as economic hedges no longer qualified for hedge accounting during the three months ended september 30 2013 the company closed out the above interest rate swaps and received a cash settlement of 13 million on termination 

the table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for interest rate swaps the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts the duration of interest rate swaps varied between one and five years with refixing periods of three to six months average fixed and variable rates are respectively the weightedaverage actual and market rates for the interest rate hedges in place market rates are the rates prevailing at december 31 2014  or 2013  as appropriate

 liquidity risk 

our objective is to ensure we have the ability to generate sufficient cash either from internal or external sources in a timely and costeffective manner to meet our commitments as they fall due our management of liquidity risk is embedded within our overall risk management framework scenario analysis is continually undertaken to ensure that our resources can meet our liquidity requirements these resources are supplemented by access to 1122 million under four revolving credit facilities of which 798 million is available for general corporate purposes we undertake shortterm foreign exchange swaps for liquidity purposes 

see ‘liquidity and capital resources’ section under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

credit risk and concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the company currently does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties the company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents fiduciary funds accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value 

the company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure these financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the company does business as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the companys concentrations of credit as of december 31 2014

we believe the combined total revenues of our international subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread and capability of our international network these operations generated approximately 30 percent  of the group’s total consolidated commissions and fees in 2013  

customers 

our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational corporations to middlemarket companies further many of our client relationships span decades for instance our relationship with the tokio marine and fire insurance company limited dates back over 100 years no one client accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues for fiscal year 2013  additionally we place insurance with approximately 2500 insurance carriers none of which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2013  

competition 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two other major providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and marsh  mclennan and aon have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

a particular area of competitive pressure is marketderived income mdi which is revenue that insurance intermediaries increasingly have been obtaining from insurance carriers contingent commissions are one type of mdi where insurance carriers remunerate intermediates based on either the volume or profitability of risks placed with the carrier while we have recently stated that we will apply a set of criteria to evaluate on a casebycase basis whether we will take mdi and in what form to date we have not accepted contingent commissions from carriers other than in our human capital practice to our knowledge we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance to the extent that our competitors accept volume or profitbased continent commissions we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

about willis 

regulation 

our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasigovernmental regulatory supervision in virtually all countries in which we operate also such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities while these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria our three most significant regulatory regions are described below 

united states 

our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the united states are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction insurance laws in the united states are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions 

european union 

the european union insurance mediation directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the eu on a basis consistent with the eu single market and customer protection aims each eu member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence good repute professional indemnity cover and financial capacity 

united kingdom 

in the united kingdom our business was previously regulated by the financial services authority fsa under legislation enacted by the uk parliament the regulation of our business transitioned from the fsa to the financial conduct authority fca on april 1 2013 the fca has a wide range of rulemaking investigatory and enforcement powers and conducts monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements 

the fca has a sole strategic objective to protect and enhance confidence in the uk financial system its operational objectives are to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers promote efficiency and choice in the market for financial services and protect and enhance the integrity of the uk financial system the fca also has a duty to act in a way that promotes competition and to minimize the extent to which regulated businesses may be used for a purpose connected with financial crime finally the fca has new powers in product intervention for instance it can instruct firms to withdraw or amend misleading financial promotions 

other 

certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment and securities licensing authorities in the united states our willis capital markets  advisory business operates through our whollyowned subsidiary willis securities inc a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member finrasipc primarily in connection with investment bankingrelated services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions willis capital markets provides advice on securities or investments in the eu through our whollyowned subsidiary willis capital markets  advisory limited which is authorized and regulated by the fca 

our failure or that of our employees to satisfy the regulators that we comply with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities can result in disciplinary action fines reputational damage and financial harm 

all companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the united states and united kingdom we do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position

risk factors 




 item   1a   risk factors 

risks relating to our business and the insurance industry 

this section describes material risks affecting the group’s business these risks could materially affect the group’s business its revenues operating income net income net assets liquidity and capital resources and ability to achieve its financial targets and accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k 

competitive risks 

worldwide economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our business and operating results are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions current global economic conditions including those associated with the ongoing eurozone crisis coupled with low customer and business confidence may have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from these conditions since 2008 many of our operations have been impacted by the weakened economic climate a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business in addition an increase in mergers and acquisitions can also result in the loss of clients while it is difficult to predict the consequences of any further deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the potential for a significant insurer to fail be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients 

the credit and economic conditions of certain european union countries remain fragile and may contribute to instability in the global credit and financial markets if credit conditions worsen or financial market volatility increases in the eurozone it is possible that it could have a negative effect on the global economy as a whole and our business operating results and financial condition if the eurozone crisis continues or further deteriorates there will likely be a negative effect on our european business as well as the businesses of our european clients further were the euro to be withdrawn entirely or the eurozone were to be dissolved as a common currency area the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time a significant devaluation of the euro would cause the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros to be significantly reduced any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits of our new growth strategy 

at our 2013 investor conference we stated that our goal is over a mediumterm period of five years to deliver midteens total shareholder return deliver consistent revenue growth in the midsingle digits and target revenue growth to outpace expense growth by more than 70 basis points we emphasized that such results could fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

in order to achieve these goals we are implementing certain revenue growth strategies and continue to strive to manage our cost base for example we announced a series of actions that include among other things the appointments of new global industry and product heads the creation of a new global human capital  benefits practice a geographic realignment of the firm’s leadership team in north america and the merger of our uk retail and global specialty businesses in light of the potential operational risks associated with these new initiatives we cannot be certain whether we will be able to realize benefits from current revenue generating or costsaving initiatives and ultimately realize our objectives there can be no assurance that our actual results will meet these financial goals 

we do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in the premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations due to the cyclical 

willis group holdings plc 

nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission levels may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a soft or softening market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin a hard or firming market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin rates however vary by geography industry and client segment we have been and continue to be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions in addition insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as ourselves the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

competition in our industry is intense and if we are unable to compete effectively we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two major global providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and marsh  mclennan and aon have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of nontraditional market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services if we are unable to compete effectively we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

the loss of our chief executive officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives 

the loss of our chief executive officer a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our chief executive officer dominic casserley and other members of our senior management but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships the insurance and reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand train and manage our employee base we may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense 

investment in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment 

from time to time we may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts including the investment of significant time and resources the possibility that these efforts will be unprofitable and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results for operations external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business in addition we can provide no assurance that the entry into new lines of business or development of new products and services will be successful 

we are continually developing and investing in new and innovative offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the market nevertheless the ability of these efforts to produce meaningful value is dependent on a number of other factors some of which are outside of our control for example we have recently launched g360 a suite of facilities for our specialty insurance clients which we expect will provide faster placement and claims agreements for our clients and promote greater price competition in the specialty insurance market the success of g360 will depend on client participation market reaction as well as other factors both inside and outside our control additionally our global human capital and benefits practice has invested substantial time and resources in launching the willis advantage under the belief that this exchange will serve a useful role to help corporations and individuals in the us manage their growing health care expenses but in order for the 

risk factors 

willis advantage to be successful health care insurers and corporate and individual participants must deem it suitable to participate in and such decisions are based on their own particular circumstances 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology to drive value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely and costeffective manner and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses our competitors are seeking to develop competing technologies and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements 

legal and regulatory risks 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we comply with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business  

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states the united kingdom the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate indeed over the last few years there has been a substantial increase in focus on and developments in these laws and regulations compliance with laws and regulations that apply to our operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations economic and trade sanctions and laws against financial crimes including client money and money laundering bribery or other corruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other anticompetitive regulations in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies monetary fines injunctions revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients while we believe that we currently maintain good relationships with our regulators and that our current systems and controls are adequate and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of applicable laws and regulations 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist our clients with matters including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims involving substantial amounts of money errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question 

claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include allegations of damages for our employees or subagents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis errors and omissions claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly in recent years in respect of selfinsured risks we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience 

we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims an example of material claims for which we are subject that are outside of the error and omissions claims context relate 

willis group holdings plc 

to those arising out of the collapse of the stanford financial group for which we acted as brokers of record on certain lines of insurance 

the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may also be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships 

accepting market derived income mdi may cause regulatory or other scrutiny which may have a material and adverse effect on our business and our position on contingent commissions may put us at a competitive disadvantage 

insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by commission or fees paid by clients intermediaries also obtain revenue from insurance carriers this is commonly known as market derived income or mdi mdi takes a variety of forms including volume or profitbased contingent commissions facilities administration charges business development agreements and fees for providing certain data to carriers we have recently stated that we will apply a set of criteria to evaluate on a casebycase basis whether we will take mdi and in what form 

mdi creates various risks intermediaries have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ interests ahead of their clients accordingly mdi may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest antitrust unfair competition and antibribery laws and regulations while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice and while we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot predict whether our position will cause regulatory or other scrutiny 

additionally as noted above contingent commissions are a form of mdi over the past five years other than in our human capital practice we have not accepted contingent commissions from carriers to our knowledge we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance if we continue to not accept contingents and our competitors accept volume or profitbased continent commissions we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

it and operational risks 

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing systems could cause material financial loss loss of human resources regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards and to be at the forefront of a range of technology relevant to our business 

if the information we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer applications or software systems or if we experience other disruptions this could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability 

risk factors 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located this may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

data security breaches or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose confidential company and personal data systems to security breaches additionally one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs 

we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information in our database however we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of data security breaches improper access to or disclosure of confidential company or personally identifiable information our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we maintain in our databases and protect it from theft computer viruses hackers or inadvertent loss in such circumstances we may be held liable to our clients which could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue further database privacy identity theft and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace 

our noncore operations such as our willis capital markets  advisory business pose certain underwriting advisory or reputational risks and can have a significant adverse impact on our financial results 

we provide a broad range of brokerage reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide we also engage in certain noncore operations for example our willis capital markets  advisory business provides advice to insurance and reinsurance companies on a broad array of mergers and acquisition transactions as well as capital markets products including acting as underwriter or agent for primary issuances operating a secondary insurancelinked securities trading desk and engaging in general capital markets and strategic advisory work these operations may pose certain underwriting advisory or reputational risks to our core business 

in addition these noncore operations although not material to the group as a whole may in any period have a material effect on our results of operations for example our willis capital markets  advisory business is transactionbased which can cause results to differ from periodtoperiod in another example our financial results in 2011 and first two quarters of 2012 were adversely impacted by the significant deterioration of the financial results of our loan protector business driven by the loss of clients through attrition and ma activity industrywide commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures 

financial risks 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility  

we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately  23 billion  as of december 31 2013 and our 2013 interest expense was  126 million  although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may 

 19 

willis group holdings plc 

 the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments 

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our pension liabilities may increase which could require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans reducing the cash available for other uses  

we have two principal defined benefit plans one in the united kingdom and the other in the united states and in addition we have several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which we operate total cash contributions to these defined benefit pension plans in 2013 were 150 million including employees salary sacrifice contributions in 2014 the company expects to make cash contributions of approximately 134 million  including employees salary sacrifice contributions to these pension plans although we may elect to contribute more future estimates are based on certain assumptions including discount rates interest rates mortality fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets 

in 2012 we agreed a revised funding strategy with the uk plans trustee under which we are committed to make additional cash contributions in the event that our adjusted ebitda exceeds certain thresholds or we make exceptional returns for our shareholders including share buybacks or special dividends as a result we may be committed to make additional contributions through to 2017 based on the prior years performance in addition during 2014 we will be required to negotiate a new funding arrangement with the uk pension trustee which may further change the contributions we are required to make during 2014 and beyond 

we have taken actions to manage our pension liabilities including closing our uk and us plans to new participants and restricting final pensionable salaries future benefit accruals in the us pension plan were also stopped or frozen on may 15 2009 nevertheless the determination of pension expense and pension funding is based on a variety of rules and regulations changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets they may also result in higher pension costs additional financial statement disclosure and accelerate and increase the need to fully fund our pension plans through increased cash contributions further a significant decline in the value of investments that fund our pension plan if not offset or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities may significantly alter the values and actuarial assumptions used to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required to fund our plan with significant additional amounts of cash in addition to the critical assumptions described above our plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan participants and surviving spouses periodic revision of those assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pension expense changes in our pension benefit obligations the related net periodic costs or credits and the required level of future cash contributions may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees the need to make additional cash contributions may reduce our financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or other needs of our business 

we could incur substantial losses including with respect to our own cash and fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies and clients if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations failed 

the deterioration of the global credit and financial markets has created challenging conditions for financial institutions including depositories and the financial strength of these institutions may continue to decline we maintain significant cash balances at various us depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the us federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits we also maintain significant cash balances in foreign financial institutions a significant portion of this fiduciary cash is held on behalf of insurance companies or clients if one or more of the institutions in which we maintain 

risk factors 

significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses we could also be liable to claims made by the insurance companies or our clients regarding the fiduciary cash held on their behalf 

a downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility and under certain circumstances may require us to offer to buy back some of our outstanding debt 

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility in addition certain downgrades would trigger a stepup in interest rates under the indentures for our 6200 senior notes due 2017 and our 7000 senior notes due 2019   which would increase our interest expense if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources this may in turn impact the assumptions when performing our goodwill impairment testing which may reduce the excess of fair value over carrying value of the reporting units   

in addition under the indenture for our 4625 senior notes due 2023 and our 6125 senior notes due 2043 if we experience a ratings decline together with a change of control event we would be required to offer to purchase our 4625 senior notes due 2023 and our 6125 senior notes due 2043 from holders unless we had previously redeemed those notes we may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses and lack of control over investments in associates 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we may acquire or dispose of or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments for example we have a call option to acquire 100 percent of the capital of gras savoye the success of our overall acquisition and disposition strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate opportunities negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions once we complete acquisitions or reorganizations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction including revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies for example if we fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from a transaction goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired in future periods 

in addition we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies which may impact our results of operations if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce overheads related to the divested assets 

we also own an interest in a number of associates such as gras savoye where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we can achieve through full integration 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at october 1 in fiscal year 2012 we recognized an impairment charge of 492 million in the consolidated statement of operations in relation to our north american business at october 1 2013 our analysis showed that the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units were in excess of the carrying values and therefore did not result in any impairment charge in 2013 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit notwithstanding the fact that we recognized an impairment charge in fiscal year 2012 for our north american reporting unit the risk remains that a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

willis group holdings plc 

for further information on our testing for goodwill impairment see ‘critical accounting estimates’ under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

willis group holdings is organized as a holding company that conducts no business of its own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries for example willis limited our uk brokerage subsidiary regulated by the fca is currently required to maintain 126 million in unencumbered and available funds of which at least 79 million must be in cash for regulatory purposes in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and make other payments to willis group holdings we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on ordinary shares 

international risks 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the united states accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside the united states and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency the table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2013 



because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses together with any net sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollar denominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure 

for example as the pound sterling strengthens the us dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase which then causes our results to be negatively impacted however any net sterling asset we are holding will be more valuable when translated into us dollars given these facts the strength of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results this risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations in the future 

where needed we deploy a hedging strategy to mitigate part of our operating exposure to exchange rate movements but such mitigating attempts may not be successful for more information on this strategy see part ii item 8  note 26 derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries 

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets the possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses these risks include 

 22 

risk factors 

 legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us and our effective tax rate may increase 

there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate which include the potential legislative actions described below and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate for example legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which we rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions including the us we could be subjected to increased taxation in addition any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased taxation 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not be directly enforceable in ireland while not directly enforceable it is possible for a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability to be enforced in ireland through common law rules however this process is subject to numerous established principles and would involve the commencement of a new set of proceedings in ireland to enforce the judgment 

as an irish company willis group holdings is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of willis group holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the us should be exempt from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from irish dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends

executive summary 

business overview 

we provide a broad range of insurance broking risk management and consulting services to our clients worldwide and organize our business into three segments global north america and international 

our global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide arising from specific industries and activities including aerospace energy marine construction property and casualty financial and executive risks financial solutions faber global fine art jewelry and specie special contingency risks hughesgibbs willis capital markets  advisory placement and reinsurance 

north america and international comprise our retail operations and provide services to small medium and large corporations and the human capital practice our largest productbased practice group provides health welfare and human resources consulting and brokerage services 

in our capacity as advisor and insurance broker we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements helping clients determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations 

due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a soft or softening market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin a hard or firming market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin rates however vary by geography industry and client segment as a result and due to the global and diverse nature of our business we view rates holistically 

willis group holdings plc 

market conditions 

market conditions in our industry are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world insurance rate movements and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients 

the industry and market in general throughout 2011 and early 2012 experienced modest increase in catastropheexposed property insurance and reinsurance pricing levels driven by significant catastrophe losses including the japanese earthquake and tsunami the new zealand earthquake and late in 2012 super storm sandy also during that period direct carriers in north america facing persistent low investment returns started to modestly raise rates in certain products this firming rate environment however generally did not extend beyond north america to impact our international retail business 

early in 2013 the reinsurance market was generally flat however as the year progressed we saw changing market sentiment driven by changes in the sources of capital and increases in capital supply in the reinsurance market most notably within the north american catastropheexposed property market the influx of third party capital coupled with changes to reinsurance buying patterns and regulatory complexity is leading to growing complexity in the reinsurance market and a softening of prices 

this pattern of new capacity and market entrants coupled with strong underwriting performance in 2013 due to the absence of natural and manmade catastrophes means that the trend of price softening is continuing as we enter 2014 and is extending to other lines of business not just catastrophe exposed property 

the outlook for our business operating results and financial condition continues to be challenging due to the global economic condition there are signs of improving conditions both in the us and within certain european union countries including a return to sustained gdp growth in certain countries if conditions in the global economy including the us the uk and the eurozone deteriorate there will likely be a negative effect on our business as well as the businesses of our clients 

in the face of this challenging economic environment we have adopted a strategy to invest selectively in growth areas defined by geography industry sector and client segment and to better align our three segments so as to among other things bring our clients greater access to the companys specialty areas and analytical capabilities our growth strategy also involves increasing our investment in and deployment of our analytical capabilities 

financial performance 

consolidated financial performance 

2013  compared to 2012   

total revenues in 2013  of 3655 million  increased by 175 million  or 50 percent  compared to 2012  this included organic growth in commissions and fees of 49 percent  and 05 percent  growth from acquisitions and disposals organic growth was achieved in all three of our operating segments led by global with 56 percent  our north america operations reported organic growth of 49 percent  which included a 5 million positive revenue recognition adjustment our international operations achieved organic growth of 41 percent  despite recognizing a 15 million negative revenue recognition adjustment foreign currency movements had a negative 12 million or 03 percent  impact on commissions and fees in 2013  

total expenses for 2013  of  2970 million  were  719 million  or 195 percent  lower compared to 2012  

the 2013  total expenses included 46 million related to the expense reduction initiative see expense reduction initiative section below conducted earlier in the year the 2012  total expenses included a 492 million noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our north american reporting unit a 200 million writeoff of unamortized cash retention awards following the decision to eliminate the repayment requirement of past awards and a 252 million expense related to the accrual for 2012 cash bonuses paid in 2013 foreign currency movements had a 9 million positive impact on total expenses in 2013  

excluding the items noted above total expenses in 2013 were 188 million or 68 percent higher than in 2012 the largest driver of this was the increase in salaries and benefits due to annual salary reviews higher charges for sharebased compensation and new hires and investments in targeted businesses and geographies in addition to these we recorded higher incentives as a result of growth in commissions and fees and the change in remuneration policy other operating expenses also increased due to travel accommodation and client entertaining costs to support business development marketing costs strategic review charges and higher professional fees 

business discussion 

the company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of 60 million from the refinancing that was completed during 2013 

the tax rate for the full year was affected by an incremental us tax expense of 9 million recorded after taking into account the impact of adjustments to the valuation allowance placed against our us deferred tax assets 

earnings from associates were down 5 million net of tax mainly due to costs of a reorganization program in our principal associate gras savoye 

net income attributable to willis shareholders from continuing operations was  365 million  or  204  per diluted share in 2013  compared to a loss of  446 million  or  258  per diluted share in 2012  the 811 million  increase in net income compared to 2012 can be attributed primarily to the nonrecurrence of the 2012 items discussed above and growth in commissions and fees partially offset by growth in expenses 

2012  compared to 2011   

total revenues in 2012 of 3480 million increased by 33 million or 10 percent compared to 2011 including a 59 million or 17 percent negative impact from movements in foreign exchange organic growth in commissions and fees of 31 percent was driven by our international and global operations our north america operations reported a decline of 06 percent in commissions and fees due to lower revenues generated by loan protector a specialty business acquired as part of the hrh business and the continued adverse impact of difficult economic conditions in the us 

total expenses in 2012 of 3689 million increased 808 million compared to 2011 primarily due to the recognition of a 492 million noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our north american reporting unit a 200 million writeoff of unamortized cash retention awards following the decision to eliminate the repayment requirement of past awards and a 252 million expense related to the accrual for 2012 cash bonuses paid in 2013 

excluding these expenses total operating expenses declined 136 million or 47 percent principally due to 180 million expense recognized in 2011 related to the operational review and favorable movements in foreign exchange partially offset by increases in salary and benefits expenses linked to annual pay reviews new hires and investments in targeted businesses and geographies 

net loss attributable to willis shareholders from continuing operations was 446 million or a loss of 258 per diluted share in 2012 compared to a profit of 203 million or 115 per diluted share in 2011 the 649 million decrease in net income compared to 2011 primarily reflects the increase in total expenses described above and the 113 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in our us operations partially offset by the nonrecurrence of the 131 million posttax cost in 2011 relating to the makewhole amounts on the repurchase and redemption of 500 million of our senior debt and the writeoff of related unamortized debt issuance costs and by the revenue growth achieved during the year net income in 2012 was also adversely impacted by a 7 million reduction in interest in earnings of associates net of tax mainly due to declining performance in our principal associate gras savoye

adjusted operating income adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations 

our nongaap measures of adjusted operating income adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are calculated by excluding the impact of certain items as detailed below from operating income loss net income loss from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations respectively the most directly comparable gaap measures 

the following items are excluded from operating income loss and net income loss from continuing operations as applicable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

we believe that excluding these items as applicable from operating income loss net income loss from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations provides a more complete and consistent comparative analysis of our results of operations we use these and other measures to establish group performance targets and evaluate the performance of our operations 

as set out in the tables below adjusted operating margin at 200 percent  in 2013  was down 160  basis points compared to 2012  while adjusted net income from continuing operations at 472 million  was  18 million  higher than in 2012  adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was 264  in 2013  compared to 258  in 2012

goodwill impairment 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at october 1 at october 1 2013  our analysis showed the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value and therefore did not result in an impairment charge  2012  492 million 2011  nil 

in 2012 an impairment charge for the north america reporting unit was required and amounted to 492 million there was no impairment for the global and international reporting units as the fair values of these units were significantly in excess of their carrying value 

correction of commissions and fees overstatement relating to 2011 and prior periods 

as previously disclosed in early 2012 we identified through our internal financial control process and a subsequent internal investigation an uncollectible accounts receivable balance of approximately 40 million in chicago from the fraudulent overstatement of commissions and fees from the years 2005 to 2011 

we concluded that the total 40 million of overstatement did not materially affect our previously issued financial statements for any of the prior periods and we corrected the misstatement by recognizing a charge to other operating expenses to write off the uncollectible receivable a of 13 million including legal expenses in the first quarter of 2012 and b of 22 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 in the fourth quarter 2011 we also reversed a 6 million balance of commissions and fees which had been recorded during 2011 and 2 million of salaries and benefits expense representing an overaccrual of production bonuses relating to the overstated revenue during 2012 we recorded within other operating expenses a 10 million insurance settlement from insurers in respect of our claim under group insurance policies for compensation paid out in the years 2005 to 2010 on the fraudulently overstated revenues discussed above 

the employees in question who have been terminated were not members of willis executive management nor did they play a significant role in internal control over financial reporting based on the results of our investigation which has now been completed we do not believe that any client or carrier funds were misappropriated or that any other business units were affected 

we have enhanced our internal controls in relation to the business unit in question including enhanced procedures over receipt of checks and application of cash increased segregation of duties between the operating unit and the accounting and settlement function and additional central sign off requirement on revenue recognition 

expense reduction initiative 

the company recorded a pretax charge of 46 million in the first quarter of 2013 related to the previously announced assessment of the companys organizational design in connection with this assessment we incurred the following pretax charges 

 the company did not incur any further charges related to this review 

the actions taken resulted in total cost savings of approximately 20 million exclusive of the costs incurred in 2013 it is also anticipated that we will achieve prospective annualized cost savings of approximately 25 million to 30 million 

cash retention awards 

for the past several years certain cash retention awards under the companys annual incentive programs included a feature which required the recipient to repay a proportionate amount of the annual award if the employee voluntarily left the company before a specified date which was generally three years following the award as previously disclosed the company made the cash payment to the recipient in the year of grant and recognized the payment in expense ratably over the period it was subject to repayment beginning in the quarter in which the award was made the unamortized portion of cash retention awards was recorded within other current assets and other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

the following table sets out the amount of cash retention awards made and the related amortization of those awards for the three years ended december 31 2013  

willis group holdings plc 



in december 2012 the company decided to eliminate the repayment requirement from past annual cash retention awards and as a result recognized a noncash pretax charge of 200 million  which represents the writeoff of the unamortized balance of past awards at that date 

there were however a number of offcycle awards with a fixed period guarantee attached for which we have not waived the repayment requirement the unamortized portion of these awards amounted to 15 million  at december 31 2013   2012  9 million  2011  196 million  

in addition in 2012 the company replaced annual cash retention awards with annual cash bonuses which did not include a repayment requirement as at december 31 2012  the company had accrued 252 million  for these bonuses 

pension expense 

we recorded a net periodic benefit income on our uk defined benefit pension plan in 2013  of 5 million   2012  5 million  2011  cost of 6 million  on our us defined benefit pension plan we recorded a net periodic benefit income of 4 million  in 2013   2012  cost of 3 million  2011   nil  on our other defined benefit pension plans we recorded a net pension cost of  5 million  in 2013   2012  4 million  2011  5 million  

the periodic benefit income on the uk plan in 2013  is flat compared to 2012  as higher asset returns were offset by higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and increased service costs 

the movement to 5 million  income on the uk plan in 2012  from a 6 million  cost in 2011  was primarily due to higher asset returns partially offset by higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and increased interest cost 

on the us plan the movement to a 4 million  income in 2013  from a 3 million  cost in 2012  was primarily due to higher asset returns 

the 2012  us pension cost was 3 million  higher compared with 2011  was primarily due to an increase in amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses partially offset by higher asset returns 

see contractual obligations below for further information on our obligations relating to our pension plans 

acquisitions and disposals 

in first quarter 2014 the company agreed to acquire charles monat limited a marketleading life insurance solutions adviser to high net worth clients the acquisition represents a key enhancement to our expanding global wealth solutions practice particularly in asia however completion of the transaction is currently subject to regulatory approval 

during first quarter 2014 the company disposed of insurance noodle a small online wholesale business in willis north america to insureon 

in fourth quarter 2013 the company acquired the employee benefits consulting division of capital strategies group inc based in birmingham alabama we disposed of the trade and assets associated with willis of northern new england to a small mainebased broker specializing in attorneys notforprofit organizations hospitals and contractors

consolidated results for 2013  compared to 2012   

revenues 

total revenues by segment for 2013  and 2012  are shown below millions except percentages 



 

 

our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited 

total revenues increased by 175 million  or 50 percent  in 2013  compared to 2012  this was primarily due to 51 percent  growth in commissions and fees and an increase of 3 million  in other income arising from the disposal of books of business partially offset by a 3 million  decrease in investment income due to continued falling yields on deposits 

total commissions and fees in 2013  were 3633 million  up 175 million  or 51 percent  from 3458 million  in 2012  this increase was due to organic growth of 49 percent  and growth through acquisitions and disposals of 05 percent  partially offset by negative foreign currency movements of 13 million or 03 percent  

organic growth of 49 percent  was driven by low doubledigit new business growth tempered by lost business 

commissions and fees were reduced by a net 9 million impact of two revenue recognition adjustments in the north america and international segments discussed below 

the global segment reported 57 percent  growth in commissions and fees comprising 56 percent  organic growth and a net 10 percent  growth from acquisitions and disposals mainly due to prime professions which was acquired in second quarter 2013 this growth was partially offset by a 09 percent  negative impact from foreign currency translation 

organic commissions and fees growth of 56 percent  was led by high singledigit growth in reinsurance where all the divisions reported positive growth global specialties reported mid singledigit growth primarily due to strong growth from financial and executive risk and pc and construction willis capital markets  advisory performed solidly but was down compared to the very strong result it recorded in 2012 relating to meaningfully higher volumes of advisory fees and catastrophe bond deals 

the north america segment reported 54 percent  growth in commissions and fees compared to 2012  this comprised organic growth of 49 percent  and acquisitions of 06 percent  from avalon actuarial inc which was acquired at the end of fourth quarter 2012 partially offset by a negative 01 percent  impact from foreign currency translation organic growth in commissions and fees was positively impacted by a 5 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in the north america personal lines business with the rest of the group 

organic growth was driven by doubledigit new business growth and increased client retention levels compared to 2012  growth was achieved across all of our north america regions led by the metro midwest canada and cappps regions 

business discussion 

similarly most of the major practice groups recorded positive growth including midsingle digit growth in our two largest practices human capital and construction 

the international segment reported 39 percent  growth in commissions and fees compared with 2012  comprising 41 percent  organic growth slightly offset by a 02 percent  negative impact from foreign currency translation organic growth in commissions and fees included the negative impact of a 15 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in china with the rest of the group 

organic growth was led by doubledigit growth in our latin america region and high singledigit growth in eastern europe we reported low singledigit growth in western europe despite the generally weak economic conditions within the region despite the negative impact of the 15 million revenue adjustment we recorded good growth in asia predominantly in hong kong and singapore we also reported low singledigit growth in australasia 

organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in review of segmental results below 

salaries and benefits 

salaries and benefits were  268 million  or 108 percent  lower in 2013  compared with 2012  foreign currency movements lowered salaries and benefits by 9 million or 04 percent 

in 2012  we recorded a 452 million charge as a result of the change in remuneration policy for future incentive awards and the elimination of the repayment requirement on past awards excluding the impact of this change and foreign currency movements salaries and benefits were up by 193 million or 95 percent this increase is primarily due to annual salary reviews increased headcount due to targeted investments increased incentives from the change in remuneration policy and growth in commissions and fees and an additional charge to increase the 401k match it also includes 29 million relating to the expense reduction initiative that was undertaken in first quarter 2013 see executive summary  expense reduction initiative section above for further details 

other expenses 

other operating expenses  were  35 million  or 60 percent  higher in 2013  compared with 2012  the 35 million  increase includes 12 million of costs that were incurred in first quarter 2013 as part of our expense reduction initiative see executive summary  expense reduction initiative above for details 

the remaining 23 million increase was primarily due to higher business development costs consulting and professional fees to assist us in our growth initiatives and marketing costs 

depreciation expense  was 94 million  in 2013  compared with 79 million  in 2012  the increase of 15 million  includes 5 million which was incurred in first quarter 2013 relating to the rationalization of property and systems as part of our expense reduction initiative see executive summary  expense reduction initiative above for details the remaining 10 million increase is primarily due to a number of significant information technology related projects becoming operational during the year and the writeoff of replaced systems and other assets 

amortization of intangible assets  was 55 million  in 2013  a reduction of 4 million  compared to 2012  the decrease primarily reflects the ongoing reduction in the hrh acquisition amortization 

net gain on disposal of operations  of 2 million  was related principally to the disposal of our share in an iberian associate 

  

loss on extinguishment of debt 

the company incurred total losses on extinguishment of debt of 60 million  during the year ended december 31 2013 this was made up of a tender premium of 65 million  the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs of 2 million  and a credit for the reduction of the fair value adjustment on 5625 senior notes due 2015 of 7 million

interest in earnings of associates net of tax 

the majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of gras savoye the leading broker in france interest in earnings of associates net of tax in 2013  was  nil  compared to 5 million  in 2012  the decline was mainly driven by lower net income recorded in gras savoye due to the costs recognized in relation to a reorganization program undertaken in the year designed to drive growth in revenues and operational efficiencies

revenues 



 

 

our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited 

business discussion 

total revenues increased by 33 million  or 10 percent  in 2012  compared to 2011  including 31 percent  growth in organic commissions and fees partially offset by a 59 million or 18 percent  negative impact from foreign exchange and a 13 million  decrease in investment income due to continued falling yields on deposits 

total commissions and fees in 2012  were 3458 million  up 44 million  or 13 percent  from 3414 million  in 2011  foreign currency movements negatively impacted commissions and fees by 18 percent  organic commissions and fees growth was 31 percent  

new business growth was in the doubledigits and there were modest benefits in the year from improving rates in certain business lines and geographies these positive movements were however offset by a slight increase in lost business 

the global segment reported 48 percent  growth in commissions and fees comprising 61 percent  organic growth in commissions and fees and a 13 percent  negative impact from foreign currency translation organic commissions and fees growth of 61 percent  was led by high singledigit growth across reinsurance and willis faber  dumas global specialties reported low singledigit growth as strong growth from our marine energy financial solutions and construction specialties were partially offset by declines in aerospace which continues to be hampered by competitive pricing and a soft rate environment 

the north america segment reported a 06 percent  decline in organic commissions and fees compared to 2011  whilst new business levels were higher than in 2011  resulting in growth in certain regions and business segments these were more than offset by lower loan protector revenues the impact of the weakened economy which negatively impacted our construction and human capital practice groups and a modest decrease in client retention levels 

the international segment reported essentially flat growth in commissions and fees compared with 2011 comprising 49 percent  organic commissions and fees growth and a 48 percent  negative impact from foreign currency translation organic growth in commissions and fees was led by double digit growth in our latin america region supported by high singledigit growth in asia and eastern europe our western europe operations reported low singledigit growth despite the continued weakness of economies within the eurozone 

investment income in 2012  at 18 million  was 13 million  lower than in 2011  primarily due to declining net yields on cash and cash equivalents organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in review of segmental results below 

salaries and benefits 

salaries and benefits increased by 388 million  or 186 percent  in 2012  compared with 2011  foreign currency movements lowered salaries and benefits by 34 million or 16 percent the yearonyear net favorable impact from foreign currency translation was driven primarily by the movement of the us dollar against the pound sterling in which our london market based operations incur the majority of their expenses 

excluding the impact of foreign exchange salaries and benefits increased by 422 million or 202 percent compared with 2011 primarily due to the 452 million expense recognized as a result of the change in remuneration policy for future incentive awards and the elimination of the repayment requirement on past awards an approximate 55 million increase in salaries including associated taxes and benefits resulting from new hires and annual pay reviews increases in incentives linked to production long term incentive plans and the amortization of cash retention awards these increases were partially offset by the 135 million expense recognized in salaries and benefits associated with the 2011 operational review and lower defined benefit pension plan expenses 

other expenses 

other operating expenses  were 75 million  or 114 percent  lower in 2012  compared with 2011  foreign currency movements positively impacted expenses by 35 million or 53 percent 

excluding the impact of foreign exchange other operating expenses decreased by 40 million or 61 percent compared with 2011 primarily due to the nonrecurrence of the 73 million expense recognized in other operating expenses associated with the 2011 operational review and the 10 million insurance recovery in 2012 related to the previously disclosed fraudulent activity partially offset by increases in certain other costs including provisioning for bad debts and higher technology expenditure 

willis group holdings plc 

depreciation expense  was 79 million  in 2012  compared with 74 million  in 2011  the increase is primarily due to a number of information technology related projects becoming operational at the end of 2011 and during first half 2012 partially offset by 5 million depreciation charge incurred in 2011 related to the operational review 

amortization of intangible assets  was 59 million  in 2012  a reduction of 9 million compared to 2011  the decrease primarily reflects the ongoing reduction in the hrh acquisition amortization 

goodwill impairment  charge was 492 million  in 2012  this was a noncash charge recognized related to the impairment of the carrying value of the north america reporting units goodwill for further information on our testing for goodwill impairment see critical accounting estimates below 

net loss on disposal of operations  of 3 million  was related principally to the dissolution of a joint venture operation in india and loss recognized on disposal of mauritian reinsurance operation 

interest expense 

interest expense was 128 million  in 2012  compared to 156 million  in 2011  the decrease in interest expense primarily reflects the nonrecurrence of a 10 million writeoff of debt fees in 2011 related to the refinancing of the term loan and revolving credit facility and savings as a result of the lower coupon payable and reduced fee amortization on our new debt issued in march 2011 and december 2011 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on ordinary income for 2012 was 25 per cent compared with 24 per cent for 2011 with the increase driven primarily by higher than anticipated us state income tax expense the benefit from the higher tax rates at which costs associated with the 2011 operational review are relieved and from a different geographic mix of earnings the effective tax rate on ordinary income is calculated before the impact of certain discrete items discrete items occurring in 2012 with a significant impact on the tax rate are

the majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of gras savoye the leading broker in france interest in earnings of associates net of tax in 2012  was 5 million  compared to 12 million  in 2011  the decline was mainly driven by a reduction in net income reported by our principal associate gras savoye

operating activities 

total net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 525 million in 2012 compared with 441 million in 2011 the increase of 84 million primarily reflects a 100 million reduction in cash outflows relating to the 2011 operational review and a higher volume of collections made on higher revenues and accounts receivable compared with 2011 partially offset by the modest decline in operating earnings adjusted for noncash items and the 11 million yearonyear increase in payments for cash retention awards 

investing activities 

total net cash used in continuing investing activities was 172 million in 2012 compared to 101 million in 2011 the 71 million increase in net outflow was due to higher capital spend including the fitout and refurbishment of certain leasehold properties including the completion of the european data center development and implementation of a number of information technology projects including financial systems and trading platforms a 23 million increase in payments to acquire subsidiaries primarily related to the acquisition of avalon actuarial inc a canadian actuarial consulting firm and the nonrecurrence of proceeds from the disposal of certain businesses during 2011 

financing activities 

total net cash used in continuing financing activities was 291 million in 2012 compared to 214 million in 2011 the 77 million increase in cash used was the result of the 100 million cash outflow relating to the repurchase of 28 million shares during 2012 and the 30 million yearonyear increase in payments made to acquire noncontrolling interests including gras savoye re and our columbian retail operation partially offset by the reduction in repayments of debt net of the refinancing during 2011

operating activities 

total net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 441 million in 2011 compared with 491 million in 2010 the decrease of 50 million primarily reflects the 57 million yearonyear increase in accounts receivable reflecting increased revenue but also slower collections in the us due to current economic conditions cash outflows of approximately 120 million relating to the 2011 operational review and the 24 million yearonyear increase in payments for cash retention awards these were partly offset by realized cash savings resulting from the 2011 operational review and other working capital movements 

investing activities

business discussion 

review of segmental results 

we organize our business into three segments global north america and international our global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for risks arising from specific industries and activities north america and international comprise our retail operations and provide services to small medium and major corporations 

the following table is a summary of our operating results by segment for the three years ended december 31 2013  in millions except percentages 



global 

our global operations comprise global specialties willis re placement and willis capital markets  advisory wcma 

the following table sets out revenues operating income organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended december 31 2013  in millions except percentages 



 

 2013  compared to 2012   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1188 million  were 64 million  or 57 percent  higher in 2013  compared with 2012  the increase includes organic growth of 56 percent  and 10 percent  growth from acquisitions and disposals most notably from the acquisition of prime professions in second quarter 2013 partially offset by a 09 percent  negative impact from foreign currency movements 

the 56 percent  organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth and higher client retention levels compared with the year ago period partially offset by lost business rates had no material impact on commissions and fees 

willis re reported high singledigit growth with north america leading the way with doubledigit results new business was strong across all three divisions and we reported increased client retention levels compared to the prior year 

specialty reported mid singledigit growth with solid performance in our financial and executive risk and pc and construction growth from new business was solid and we saw increased client retention levels compared to 2012 

willis group holdings plc 

willis capital markets  advisory performed solidly but was down compared to the very strong result it recorded in 2012 relating to meaningfully higher volumes of advisory fees and catastrophe bond deals 

client retention levels improved to 919 percent  for 2013  compared with 903 percent  for 2012  

expenses 

total operating expenses of 857 million  were 100 million  or 132 percent  higher for 2013  compared with 2012  excluding the 8 million or 11 percent impact of favorable foreign currency movements total operating expenses increased 108 million or 143 percent 

the yearonyear growth in expenses was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits as a result of increased incentives 

from the change in remuneration policy and growth in commissions and fees in addition this increase also included the impact of the increase in headcount relative to the prior year annual salary reviews and higher charges for sharebased compensation 

other expenses also increased compared to 2012 due to higher travel accommodation and client entertaining costs to support business development and increased professional fees related to the strategic review of the segment 

operating margin 

full year operating margin was 280 percent  in 2013  and 329 percent  in 2012  the decline was driven by the additional expenses discussed above partially offset by solid commissions and fees growth 

2012  compared to 2011   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1124 million  were 51 million  or 48 percent  higher in 2012  compared with 2011  foreign exchange movements had a net 13 percent  negative impact on commissions and fees organic growth was 61 percent  

organic growth included positive growth across reinsurance global specialties willis faber  dumas and wcma as strong new business and higher oneoff transactions primarily in wcma were partially offset by increases in lost business 

organic growth in global specialties was led by strong performances from energy marine financial solutions and construction specialties reflecting singledigit net new business this growth was partially offset by declines in aerospace which continued to be negatively impacted by competitive pricing and rate decreases 

reinsurance reported mid singledigit growth in 2012 as growth in the international specialty and north america divisions was partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a fee related to a 2011 profitability initiative rates had a modest positive impact on commission and fees in the year 

willis faber  dumas also reported midsingle digit growth in 2012wcma is a transactionoriented business and its results are more variable than some of our other businesses in 2012 we reported significantly higher organic commissions and fees than in 2011 growth in the wcma business was positively impacted by a higher volume of advisory and catastrophe bond deals closing during the year 

client retention levels declined to 903 percent  for 2012  compared with 913 percent  for 2011  

operating margin 

operating margin was 329 percent  in 2012  and 325 percent  in 2011  the organic growth in commissions and fees discussed above and lower defined benefit pension costs were offset by higher salary and benefit expense due to the impact of annual salary increases and new hires higher production linked incentives and increases to discretionary costs 

business discussion 

north america 

our north america business provides risk management insurance brokerage related risk services and employee benefits brokerage and consulting to a wide array of industry and client segments in the united states canada and mexico 

the following table sets out revenues operating income organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended december 31 2013  in millions except percentages 



 

 

2013  compared to 2012   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1377 million  were 71 million  or 54 percent  higher in 2013  compared with 2012  

this increase was primarily due to organic growth of 49 percent  and 06 percent  positive impact from the acquisition of avalon actuarial inc in fourth quarter 2012 partially offset by a 01 percent  negative impact from foreign currency movements 

commissions and fees included a positive 5 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in the north america personal lines business with the rest of the group 

the 49 percent  organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth and higher client retention levels compared with the year ago period partially offset by lost business rates had a small positive impact on the full years commissions and fees 

growth was achieved across all our north america regions led by the metro midwest canada and cappps regions this was attributed to new business growth as well as increased client retention rates in almost all regions 

similarly most of the major practice groups recorded positive growth our two largest practices human capital and construction recorded mid singledigit growth and in our other practices we recorded high singledigit growth in real estate and low singledigit growth in financial  executive risks healthcare and manufacturing 

client retention levels were 920 percent  in 2013  compared with 907 percent  in 2012  

expenses 

total operating expenses of 1117 million  were 44 million  or 41 percent  higher for 2013 compared to 2012 

the yearonyear growth is primarily due to higher salaries and benefits most notably as a result of annual salary reviews salaries and benefits were also impacted by a higher incentives charge as a result of higher commissions and fees and the 

willis group holdings plc 

change in remuneration policy and additional 401k match and medical charges partially offset by lower charges for sharebased compensation and pensions 

in addition there was an increase in other expenses due to a 6 million writeoff of a receivable related to a noneo settlement professional fees related to the strategic review of the segment and higher travel and accommodation expense to support revenue growth and client retention partially offset by a 4 million insurance premium accrual reversal 

foreign currency movements had no material impact on expenses 

operating margin 

operating margin in north america was 194 percent  in 2013  compared with 183 percent  in 2012  driven by solid commissions and fees growth 

2012  compared to 2011   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1306 million  were 8 million  or 06 percent  lower in 2012  compared with 2011  

organic commissions and fees growth declined 06 percent  in 2012  compared with 2011  whilst new business levels were higher than in 2011  resulting in growth in certain regions and business segments these were more than offset by lower loan protector revenues and the impact of the weakened economy 

the decline in the financial performance of our loan protector business had a 08 percent negative impact on north america organic growth in commissions and fees and negatively impacted the segments revenue by 10 million the loan protector decline was driven by the loss of clients through attrition and ma activity industrywide commission pressures and a slowdown in business in its specialized market in the us in 2011  

client retention levels were 907 percent  in 2012  compared with 915 percent  in 2011  

operating margin 

operating margin in north america was 183 percent  in 2012  compared with 205 percent  in 2011  reflecting the adverse impact from the 06 percent  decline in organic commissions and fees growth discussed above a 4 million  reduction in investment income due to declining yields and increases to incentive expenses production linked awards and sharebased compensation these were partly offset by a reduction to other expenses including lower premises costs and a reduction in eo provisions

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1068 million  were 40 million  or 39 percent  higher in 2013  compared with 2012  organic commissions and fees growth was 41 percent  partially offset by 02 percent  negative impact from foreign currency movements 

organic growth included doubledigit new business growth partly offset by lost business rates had no significant impact on commissions and fees 

commissions and fees included the negative impact of a 15 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in china with the rest of the group 

latin america reported doubledigit growth arising primarily from brazil and venezuela which was partially offset by a doubledigit decline in colombia 

asia reported lowsingle digit growth we recorded good growth throughout the region especially in hong kong and korea however the negative 15 million revenue recognition adjustment partially offset these results 

eastern europe reported high singledigit growth arising primarily from russia tempered by a midsingle digit decline in poland 

western europe reported low singledigit growth despite difficult economic conditions italy and iberia produced midsingle digit growth partially offset by mid singledigit declines in ireland and the netherlands 

the uk reported a low singledigit decline amid a challenging economic environment 

client retention rates were largely flat at 931 percent  for 2013  compared to 933 percent  for 2012  

expenses 

total operating expenses of 897 million  were 42 million  or 49 percent  higher for 2013 compared with 2012 foreign currency movements favorably impacted operating expenses by 12 million or 14 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency movements total operating expenses increased 54 million or 63 percent 

willis group holdings plc 

this increase was due primarily to higher salaries and benefits as a result of new hires annual salary reviews higher incentives due to the change in remuneration policy and an increased charge for sharebased compensation 

in addition to this we incurred professional fees related to the strategic review of the segment higher travel and accommodation expense to support business development and a 5 million vat related charge these charges were partially offset by a reduced bad debt expense and nonrecurring 2012 legal claims settlements 

operating margin 

operating margin in international was 168 percent  in 2013  compared with 176 percent  in 2012  the decline was driven by the increase in expenses discussed above partially offset by solid commissions and fees growth 

2012  compared to 2011   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1028 million  were 1 million  or 01 percent  higher in 2012  compared with 2011  organic commissions and fees growth of 49 percent  was partially offset by negative foreign exchange movements of 48 percent  organic growth included double digit new business growth partly offset by slight increases to lost business rates and other market factors had no significant impact on commissions and fees in the year 

despite the ongoing economic difficulties faced by the eurozone our large retail operations in the region delivered low singledigit growth in 2012  driven by strong growth in germany sweden and denmark although this growth was partially offset by declines in ireland and norway 

our latin american operation delivered high doubledigit growth in 2012  the result of significant new business growth principally in brazil venezuela and argentina 

asia reported high singledigit growth in 2012  led by strong growth in japan china and korea 

organic growth in our uk retail operation was flat in 2012  compared with 2011  this reflects a stabilization of the business in the region following a 23 percent decline in 2011  

a significant part of internationals revenues are earned in currencies other than the us dollar most notably the euro and the australian dollar the net 48 percent  negative impact from foreign currency translation in 2012  primarily reflected the weakening of the us dollar against these and other currencies in which we earn international revenues 

client retention levels decreased to 933 percent  for 2012  compared with 937 percent  for 2011  

operating margin 

operating margin in international was 176 percent  in 2012  compared with 212 percent  in 2011  the decrease primarily reflected significant increases in salaries and benefits as a result of new hires supporting growth in targeted geographies annual pay increases the negative impact of foreign exchange on revenues and increases to certain provisions including bad debts these were partly offset by the benefit from organic commissions and fees discussed above

critical accounting estimates 

our accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance 

 management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our audit committee 

pension expense 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the us and uk both of these plans are now closed to new entrants and with effect from may 15 2009 we closed our us defined benefit plan to future accrual new employees in the uk are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the us are offered the opportunity to join a 401k plan we also have smaller defined benefit plans in ireland germany norway and the netherlands a nonqualified plan in the us and an unfunded plan in the uk these smaller defined benefit plans have combined total assets of 168 million  and a combined net liability for pension benefits of 27 million  as of december 31 2013  elsewhere pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans 

we recorded a 5 million  and a 4 million  net periodic benefit income on our uk and us defined benefit pension scheme respectively in 2013  compared with a net periodic benefit income of 5 million on the uk scheme and a net periodic benefit cost of 3 million on the us scheme in 2012  on our international defined benefit pension plans us nonqualified plan and uk unfunded plan we recorded a net periodic benefit cost of 5 million  in 2013  compared with 4 million  in 2012  

based on december 31 2013  assumptions except for one update  the expected rate of return in the uk pension plan changed from 725 to 700 we expect the net pension credit in 2014  will increase 7 million for the uk plan the net pension credit will increase by 4 million for the us plan and the net pension charge will decrease by 1 million for the other plans 

we make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate the discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination our approach to determining appropriate assumptions for our uk and us pension plans is set out below

business discussion 

discount rate 

during 2013 we continued to use a durationbased approach which more closely matches the actual timing of expected cash flows to the applicable discount rate the selected rate used to discount uk plan liabilities in 2013 was 440  consistent with the 440  used at december 31 2012  during 2013 sterling highquality corporate bond yields had risen slightly at shorter to median durations but fallen at longer durations however the rate consistent with expected maturity of the plans liabilities was unchanged 

expected and actual asset returns 

expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net uk pension expense in 2013  was 725   2012  750  equivalent to an expected return in 2013  of 191 million  2012  181 million effective january 1 2014 the expected longterm rate of return was decreased to 700 the decrease in the expected longterm rate of return followed a change in the underlying target asset mix which reflects the actions taken during 2013 in accordance with the derisking strategy proposed by the trustees which will lead to a strategic target asset allocation with a greater weighting to nonreturn seeking assets 

the expected and actual returns on uk plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2013  were as follows 



mortality 

the mortality assumption used during 2013 is the 90105 pna00 table for males and females and is unchanged from the assumptions used during 2012 

as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a uk male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2013  would have a life expectancy of 24 years 

us plan 



 

 discount rate 

the discount rate at december 31 2013  was 476  an increase of 69 basis points from the discount rate of 407  at december 31 2012  the increase in the discount rate reflects the increase in highquality corporate bond yields during 2013 

the impact of the higher discount rate in 2013  decreased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 86 million

expected and actual asset returns 

the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net us pension scheme expense in 2013  was 725  2012 725

intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of businesses acquired we classify our intangible assets into three categories 

• goodwill 

 • ‘contractbased technology and other’ which includes all other purchased intangible assets 

client relationships acquired on the hrh acquisition are amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected to be consumed over 80 of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized after 10 years noncompete agreements acquired in connection with the hrh acquisition were amortized over two years on a straight line basis intangible assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis goodwill is not subject to amortization 

we review purchased intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the purchased intangible assets with finite lives are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value 

goodwill impairment review 

we test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 

the goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis step one requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its carrying value if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform step two step two requires the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to be compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

business discussion 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit 

determination of reporting units 

we have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments north america international and global goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the reporting units 

fair value of reporting units 

the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and in aggregate validated against our market capitalization 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include estimations of future cash flows which are dependent on internal forecasts longterm rate of growth for our business and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain therefore changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and result in goodwill impairment 

in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

annual goodwill impairment analysis 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at october 1 at october 1 2013 our analysis showed the estimate fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of carrying value and therefore did not result in an impairment charge 

the goodwill impairment analysis as of october 1 2012 concluded that an impairment charge was required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the companys north america reporting unit the goodwill impairment charge for the north america reporting unit amounted to 492 million there was no impairment for the global and international reporting units as the fair values of these units were significantly in excess of their carrying value 

under the income approach the fair value of the north america reporting unit was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the fair value measurements used unobservable inputs in a discounted cash flow model based on the companys most recent forecasts such projections were based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows with consideration of market comparables where appropriate the discount rate was based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with market participant expectations of characteristics of the individual reporting units 

as the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value the second step of the impairment test was performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss in the second step the north america reporting units fair value was allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets the fair value of intangible assets associated with the north america reporting unit included customer relationship intangible assets which were valued using a multiple period excess earnings approach involving discounted future projections of associated revenue streams 

the decline in the fair value of the north america reporting unit as well as differences between fair values and carrying values for other assets and liabilities in the second step of the goodwill impairment test resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill substantially below the carrying value of the goodwill for the reporting unit as a result the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 492 million in 2012 

as previously disclosed the north america reporting unit had been hampered by the declining loan protector business results the effect of the soft economy in the us which had significantly impacted the construction and human capital sectors and declining retention rates primarily related to ma activity and lost legacy hrh business 

the decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit resulted from lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as well as an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows the increase in the discount rate was due to increases in the riskfree rate and small company premium offset by a reduction to the expected market rate of 

willis group holdings plc 

return the lower projected profitability levels reflect changes in assumptions related to organic revenue growth and cost rates which can be attributed to the declines discussed above and also includes consideration of the uncertainty related to the businesss ability to execute on the projected cash flows 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards we estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies 

at december 31 2013  we had gross deferred tax assets of 383 million   2012  451 million  against which a valuation allowance of 196 million   2012  221 million  had been recognized to the extent that 

 we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income 

positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities the benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts the company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions in 2013  there was a net increase in uncertain tax positions of 4 million compared to a net increase of 21 million in 2012  the company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

we purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly over recent years we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice

new accounting standards 

other comprehensive income 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income to revise the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements these changes require that components of comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net incomethis guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 and has been applied retrospectively 

willis group holdings plc 

asu no 201105 also requires entities to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented in december 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201112 in order to defer those changes in asu no 201105 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments in february 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive asu 201302 this guidance is the culmination of the fasbs deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income aoci the amendments in asu 201302 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income but do require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of aoci in its entirety by component on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income must be crossreferenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2012 and has been applied retrospectively 

presentation of unrecognized tax benefits 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201311 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force the asu does not affect the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions under us gaap 

however under the asu unrecognized tax benefits or portions of unrecognised tax benefits must be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to deferred tax assets when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists except when 

 

if either of these conditions exists an entity should present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset 

the amendments under the asu 

 

the company has decided to not adopt this guidance early however as an indication of the likely balance sheet reclassification based on the position at december 31 2013 the company had recognized 22 million  of unrecognized tax benefits within other noncurrent liabilities that would be reclassified to noncurrent deferred tax assets the company has not yet determined whether it will apply the amendments to the prior reporting period for its first quarter 2014 reporting 

other than the changes described above there were no new accounting standards issued during 2013  that would impact on the company’s reporting

financial risk management 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 — basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements and further disclosure is provided in note 26 — derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

foreign exchange risk management 

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the united states we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling 

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2013  



our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from 

 london market operations 

in our london market operations we earn revenue in a number of different currencies principally us dollars pounds sterling euros and japanese yen but incur expenses almost entirely in pounds sterling 

we hedge this risk as follows 

 however where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit we do not hedge the risk consequently if our london market operations have a significant pension asset or liability we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the us dollar and pounds sterling exchange rate changes we do however hedge the pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan 

translation risk 

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower 

willis group holdings plc 

with the exception of foreign currency hedges for certain intercompany loans that are not designated as hedging instruments we do not hedge translation risk 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within three years 





 

 income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the uk is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities 

interest rate risk management 

our operations are financed principally by 2054 million fixed rate senior notes issued by the group and 274 million under a 7year term loan facility of the fixed rate senior notes 148 million are due 2015 300 million are due 2016 394 million are due 2017 187 million are due 2019 500 million are due 2021 250 million are due 2023 and 275 million are due 2043 the 7year term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments and a final repayment of 186 million is due in the second quarter of 2018 as of december 31 2013  we had access to 822 million under three revolving credit facilities and as at this date no amount was outstanding under those facilities the interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown 

we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in both us dollars and pounds sterling 

market risk 

as a result of our operating activities we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies we earn interest on these funds which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity in order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets we entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest in the various currencies related to the shortterm investments the use of interest rate contracts essentially converted groups of shortterm variable rate investments to fixed rates however in the fourth quarter of 2011 we stopped renewing hedged positions on their maturity given the flat yield curve environment further to this during second quarter 2012 the company closed out its legacy position for these interest rate swap contracts 

during the year ended december 31 2010 the company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of 350 million to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semiannual basis with a maturity date of july 15 2015 the company had previously designated these instruments as fair value hedges against its 350 million 5625 senior notes due 2015 and had accounted for them accordingly until the first quarter of 2013 at which point these swaps although remaining as economic hedges no longer qualified for hedge accounting during the three months ended september 30 2013 the company closed out the above interest rate swaps and received a cash settlement of 13 million on termination 

the table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for interest rate swaps the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts the duration of interest rate swaps varied between one and five years with refixing periods of three to six months average fixed and variable rates are respectively the weightedaverage actual and market rates for the interest rate hedges in place market rates are the rates prevailing at december 31 2013  or 2012  as appropriate 





  

 

 

willis group holdings plc 

liquidity risk 

our objective is to ensure we have the ability to generate sufficient cash either from internal or external sources in a timely and costeffective manner to meet our commitments as they fall due our management of liquidity risk is embedded within our overall risk management framework scenario analysis is continually undertaken to ensure that our resources can meet our liquidity requirements these resources are supplemented by access to 822 million under three revolving credit facilities we undertake shortterm foreign exchange swaps for liquidity purposes 

see ‘liquidity and capital resources’ section under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

credit risk and concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the company currently does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties the company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk however it is the companys policy to enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties as practical 

concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value 

the company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure these financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the company does business as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the companys concentrations of credit as of december 31 2013

dublin ireland 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of willis group holdings public limited company and subsidiaries the company as of december 31 2013  based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 1992  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013  based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 1992  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

customers 

our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational corporations to middlemarket companies further many of our client relationships span decades for instance our relationship with the tokio marine and fire insurance company limited dates back over 100 years no one client accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues for fiscal year 2012 additionally we place insurance with approximately 2500 insurance carriers none of which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2012 

competition 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price according to the directory of agents and brokers published by business insurance in july 2012 the 140 largest commercial insurance brokers globally reported brokerage revenues totaling 44 billion in 2011 of which marsh  mclennan companies inc had approximately 26 percent aon corporation had approximately 26 percent and willis being the third largest broker had approximately 8 percent 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two other providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and marsh  mclennan and aon have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers many insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

willis group holdings plc 

in addition to date we have not accepted contingent commissions from carriers in the nonhuman capital areas of our retail brokerage business to our knowledge we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance we seek to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to our clients and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of valueadded risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities we cannot be certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable organic revenue growth if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors who are accepting or may accept contingent commissions we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

regulation 

our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasigovernmental regulatory supervision in virtually all countries in which we operate also such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities while these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria our three most significant regulatory regions are described below 

united states 

our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the united states are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction insurance laws in the united states are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions 

european union 

the european union insurance mediation directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the eu on a basis consistent with the eu single market and customer protection aims each eu member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence good repute professional indemnity cover and financial capacity 

united kingdom 

in the united kingdom our business is currently regulated by the financial services authority under legislation enacted by the uk parliament the regulation of our business will be transitioned from the fsa to the financial conduct authority fca on or about april 1 2013 the fca will have a wide range of rulemaking investigatory and enforcement powers and will conduct monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements 

the fca will have a sole strategic objective to protect and enhance confidence in the uk financial system its operational objectives will be to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers promote efficiency and choice in the market for financial services and protect and enhance the integrity of the uk financial system the fca will also have a duty to act in a way that promotes competition and to minimize the extent to which regulated businesses may be used for a purpose connected with financial crime finally the fca will have new powers in product intervention for instance it will be able to instruct firms to withdraw or amend misleading financial promotions

 item 1a — risk factors 

risks relating to our business and the insurance industry 

this section describes material risks affecting the group’s business these risks could materially affect the group’s business its revenues operating income net income net assets liquidity and capital resources and ability to achieve its financial targets and accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k 

competitive risks 

worldwide economic conditions including those associated with the current eurozone crisis could have an adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our business and operating results are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions current global economic conditions including those associated with the current eurozone crisis coupled with low customer and business confidence may have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from these conditions for example our human capital practice may be adversely affected as businesses downsize during this period of economic turmoil and our construction business may be adversely affected by the lack of new construction over the past few years our north american and uk and irish retail operations have been particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and the global economic downturn has negatively affected some of the international economies that have supported the strong growth in our international operations 

a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business in addition an increase in mergers and acquisitions can also result in the loss of clients while it is difficult to predict consequences of any further deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the potential for a significant insurer to fail be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients 

the credit and economic conditions within certain european union countries remain poor and have contributed to the instability in the global credit and financial markets while the outcome of the current credit and economic crisis cannot be predicted it is possible that it could have a negative effect on the global economy as a whole and our business operating results and financial condition if the eurozone crisis continues or further deteriorates there will likely be a negative effect on our european business which constitutes approximately 40 percent of our business in terms of revenue as well as the businesses of our european clients if the euro were to be withdrawn entirely or the eurozone were to be dissolved as a common currency area the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time a significant devaluation of the euro would cause the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros to be significantly reduced any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

in light of the current global economic uncertainty we strive to manage our cost base vigorously in order to fund further growth initiatives we cannot be certain whether we will be able to realize benefits from current costsaving or revenue generating initiatives or any new initiatives that we may implement including the announced headcount reductions we are proposing in 2013 

we do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services we do not determine insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions 

the years 2005 through 2010 were generally viewed as soft market years across most of our product offering and our commission revenues and operating margins throughout that period were negatively impacted although in 2009 the market experienced modest stabilization in the reinsurance market and certain specialty markets 

risk factors 

our north america uk and irish retail operations were particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market throughout 2009 and 2010 with no material improvement in rates across most sectors in these geographic regions this resulted in declines in revenues in these operations particularly amongst our smaller clients who have been especially vulnerable to the economic downturn 

in 2011 we saw some modest increases in catastropheexposed property insurance and reinsurance pricing levels driven by significant 2011 catastrophe losses including the japanese earthquake and tsunami the new zealand earthquake the midwest us tornadoes and thailand floods in 2012 the trend in rates noted in 2011 in catastropheexposed regions continued as insurance and reinsurance rates in such regions or sectors have firmed or hardened however in general we continue to be negatively impacted by the soft insurance market across other sectors and most geographic regions 

there have also been recent signs that the unprofitability of certain business lines such as property catastrophe and workers compensation is slowly firming rates in those lines however we believe that in the absence of a significant catastrophe loss or capital impairment in the industry a universal turn in market rates is not likely to occur 

in addition insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as ourselves the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

competition in our industry is intense and if we are unable to compete effectively we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two other providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and marsh  mclennan and aon have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers many insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

in addition to date we have not accepted contingent commissions from carriers in the nonhuman capital areas of our retail brokerage business to our knowledge we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance we seek to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to our clients and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of valueadded risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities we cannot be certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable organic revenue growth if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors who are accepting or may accept contingent commissions we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

dependence on key personnel — the loss of our chief executive officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives 

the loss of our chief executive officer a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our chief executive officer dominic casserley and other members of our senior management but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships the insurance and reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand train and manage our employee base we may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense 

willis group holdings plc 

legal and regulatory risks 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states the united kingdom and the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate indeed over the last few years there has been a substantial increase in focus and developments in these laws and regulations compliance with laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations economic and trade sanctions and laws against financial crimes including money laundering bribery or other corruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or the uk bribery act in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies fines injunctions revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients 

in 2011 we and the fsa announced a settlement for lapses by willis limited our uk brokerage subsidiary in its implementation and documentation of its controls to counter the risks of improper payments being made to nonfsa authorized overseas third parties engaged to help win business particularly in highrisk jurisdictions 

as a result of the fsa settlement we are conducting a further internal review of certain highrisk payments made by our uk subsidiary between 2005 and 2009 we do not believe that this further internal review will result in any material fines or sanctions but there can be no assurance that any resolution will not have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business in certain jurisdictions while we believe that our current systems and controls are adequate and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of applicable laws and regulations 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist our clients with matters including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims involving substantial amounts of money errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question 

claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include allegations of damages for our employees or subagents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis errors and omissions claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly in recent years in respect of selfinsured risks we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience 

we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims an example of material claims for which we are subject that are outside of the error and omissions claims context relate to those arising out of the collapse of the stanford financial group for which we acted as brokers of record on certain lines of insurance 

the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may also be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships 

risk factors 

accepting market derived income may cause regulatory or other scrutiny which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by means of commission increasingly intermediaries are also obtaining revenue from insurance markets carriers this is commonly known as market derived income or mdi mdi takes a variety of forms including contingent and profit commissions facilities administration charges relationship services and fees for the provision of information 

mdi creates various risks intermediaries have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from markets can incentivize intermediaries to put the interests of carriers ahead of their clients in addition mdi may be subject to further scrutiny by the various regulators finally payments from carriers to intermediaries could have implications under the uk bribery act and create potential exposure under fair competition and antitrust laws 

while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice and while we will only accept mdi in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and consistent with ethical business practices we cannot predict whether our position will cause regulatory or other scrutiny 

it and operational risks 

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing systems or data security breaches could cause material financial loss loss of human resources regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards and to be at the forefront of a range of technology relevant to our business 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs 

if the information we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer applications or software systems or if we experience other disruptions this could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located this may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

willis group holdings plc 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information in our database however we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we maintain in our databases and protect it from theft computer viruses hackers or inadvertent loss in such circumstances we may be held liable to our clients which could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue further database privacy identity theft and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace 

our noncore operations such as our willis capital markets  advisory business pose certain underwriting advisory or reputational risks and can have a significant adverse impact on our financial results 

we provide a broad range of brokerage reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide we also engage in certain noncore operations for example our willis capital markets  advisory business provides advice to insurance and reinsurance companies on a broad array of mergers and acquisition transactions as well as capital markets products including acting as underwriter or agent for primary issuances operating a secondary insurancelinked securities trading desk and engaging in general capital markets and strategic advisory work these operations may pose certain underwriting advisory or reputational risks to our core business 

in addition these noncore operations although not material to the group as a whole may in any period have a material effect on our results of operations for example our willis capital markets  advisory business is transactionbased which can cause results to differ from periodtoperiod in addition our financial results in 2011 and first three quarters of 2012 were adversely impacted by the significant deterioration of the financial results of our loan protector business driven by the loss of clients through attrition and ma activity industrywide commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures 

financial risks 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility 

we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 24 billion  as of december 31 2012  and our 2012  interest expense was  128 million  although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may 

 the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments 

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risk factors 

our pension liabilities may increase which could require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans reducing the cash available for other uses 

we have two principal defined benefit plans one in the united kingdom and the other in the united states and in addition we have several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which we operate total cash contributions to these defined benefit pension plans in 2012 were 120 million  cash contributions of approximately 131 million  will be required in 2013 for these pension plans although we may elect to contribute more future estimates are based on certain assumptions including discount rates interest rates mortality fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets 

in 2012 we agreed a revised funding strategy with the uk plans trustee under which we are committed to make additional cash contributions in the event that our adjusted ebitda exceeds certain thresholds or we make exceptional returns for our shareholders including share buybacks or special dividends as a result we may be committed to make additional contributions in 2014 through 2016 based on the prior years performance 

we have taken actions to manage our pension liabilities including closing our uk and us plans to new participants and restricting final pensionable salaries future benefit accruals in the us pension plan were also stopped or frozen on may 15 2009 nevertheless the determination of pension expense and pension funding is based on a variety of rules and regulations changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets they may also result in higher pension costs additional financial statement disclosure and accelerate and increase the need to fully fund our pension plans through increased cash contributions further a significant decline in the value of investments that fund our pension plan if not offset or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities may significantly alter the values and actuarial assumptions used to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required to fund our plan with significant additional amounts of cash in addition to the critical assumptions described above our plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan participants and surviving spouses periodic revision of those assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pension expense changes in our pension benefit obligations the related net periodic costs or credits and the required level of future cash contributions may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees the need to make additional cash contributions may reduce the company’s financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or other needs of our business 

we could incur substantial losses including with respect to our own cash and fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies and clients if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations failed 

the deterioration of the global credit and financial markets has created challenging conditions for financial institutions including depositories and the financial strength of these institutions may continue to decline we maintain significant cash balances at various us depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the us federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits we also maintain significant cash balances in foreign financial institutions a significant portion of this fiduciary cash is held on behalf of insurance companies or clients if one or more of the institutions in which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses we could also be liable to claims made by the insurance companies or our clients regarding the fiduciary cash held on their behalf 

a downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility 

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility in addition certain downgrades would trigger a stepup in interest rates under the indentures for our 62 senior notes due 2017 and our 70 senior notes due 2019   which would increase our interest expense if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources this may in turn impact the assumptions when performing our goodwill impairment testing which may reduce the excess of fair value over carrying value of the reporting units 

willis group holdings plc 

we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses and lack of control over investments in associates 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we may acquire or dispose of or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate opportunities negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions once we complete acquisitions or reorganizations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction including revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies for example if we fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from a transaction goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired in future periods 

in addition we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies which may impact our results of operations if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce overheads related to the divested assets 

we also own an interest in a number of associates such as gras savoye where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we can achieve through full integration 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at october 1 at october 1 2012 our analysis showed the estimated fair values of our global and international reporting units were significantly in excess of the carrying values and therefore did not result in an impairment charge 2011 nil 2010 nil however the fair value of our north american reporting unit was not in excess of the carrying value and an impairment charge has been recognized in the consolidated statement of operations of 492 million  2011  nil  2010  nil  

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit notwithstanding the fact that we have recognized an impairment charge this year for our north american reporting unit the risk remains that a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

for further information on our testing for goodwill impairment see ‘critical accounting estimates’ under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

willis group holdings is organized as a holding company that conducts no business of its own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and make other payments to willis group holdings we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on ordinary shares 

risk factors 

international risks 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the united states accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside the united states and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency the table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2012 



 

i in 2012 the proportion of expenses incurred in pounds sterling was lower than in 2011 as a result of increased us dollar expenses primarily due to the impact of the goodwill impairment charge 

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses together with any net sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollar denominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure 

for example as the pound sterling strengthens the us dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase which then causes our results to be negatively impacted however any net sterling asset we are holding will be more valuable when translated into us dollars given these facts the strength of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results this risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations in the future 

where needed we deploy a hedging strategy to mitigate part of our operating exposure to exchange rate movements but such mitigating attempts may not be successful for more information on this strategy see part ii item 8  note 26 derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries 

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets the possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses these risks include

willis group holdings plc 

 legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us and our effective tax rate may increase 

there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate which include the potential legislative actions described below and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate for example legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which we rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions including the us we could be subjected to increased taxation in addition any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased taxation 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not be directly enforceable in ireland while not directly enforceable it is possible for a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability to be enforced in ireland through common law rules however this process is subject to numerous established principles and would involve the commencement of a new set of proceedings in ireland to enforce the judgment 

as an irish company willis group holdings is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of willis group holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states

share data and dividends 

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the us should be exempted from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends 

with respect to noncorporate us shareholders certain dividends from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states such as our shares noncorporate us shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as ‘investment income’ pursuant to section 163d4 of the code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation in addition the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances

executive summary 

business overview 

we provide a broad range of insurance broking risk management and consulting services to our clients worldwide and organize our business into three segments global north america and international 

our global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide arising from specific industries and activities including aerospace energy marine construction property and casualty financial and executive risks financial solutions faber global fine art jewelry and specie special contingency risks and reinsurance 

north america and international comprise our retail operations and provide services to small medium and large corporations and the human capital practice our largest productbased practice group provides health welfare and human resources consulting and brokerage services 

in our capacity as advisor and insurance broker we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements helping clients determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations 

due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a soft or softening market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin a hard or firming market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin 

business discussion 

market conditions 

the years 2005 through 2010 were generally viewed as soft market years across most of our product offerings and our commission revenues and operating margins throughout that period were negatively impacted although in 2009 the market experienced modest stabilization in the reinsurance market and certain specialty markets 

our north america uk and irish retail operations were particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market throughout 2009 and 2010 with no material improvement in rates across most sectors in these geographic regions this resulted in declines in revenues in these operations particularly amongst our smaller clients who have been especially vulnerable to the economic downturn 

in 2011 we saw some modest increases in catastropheexposed property insurance and reinsurance pricing levels driven by significant 2011 catastrophe losses including the japanese earthquake and tsunami the new zealand earthquake the midwest us tornadoes and thailand floods the trend in rates noted in 2011 in catastropheexposed regions continues as insurance and reinsurance rates in such regions firmed or hardened during 2012 however in general we continued to be negatively impacted by the soft insurance market and challenging economic conditions across other sectors and most geographic regions 

there have been recent signs that the unprofitability of certain business lines such as property catastrophe and workers compensation is slowly firming rates in those lines however we believe that in the absence of a significant catastrophe loss or capital impairment in the industry a universal turn in market rates is not likely to occur 

the outlook for our business operating results and financial condition continues to be challenging due to the economic conditions within certain european union countries in particular greece ireland italy portugal and spain if the eurozone crisis continues or further deteriorates there will likely be a negative effect on our european business as well as the businesses of our european clients a significant devaluation of the euro would cause the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros to be reduced 

financial performance 

consolidated financial performance 

2012  compared to 2011   

total revenues in 2012 of 3480 million  increased by 33 million  or 1 percent  compared to 2011 including a 59 million or 2 percent  negative impact from movements in foreign exchange organic growth in commissions and fees of 3 percent  was driven by our international and global operations our north america operations reported a decline of 1 percent  in commissions and fees due to lower revenues generated by loan protector a specialty business acquired as part of the hrh business and the continued adverse impact of difficult economic conditions in the us 

total expenses in 2012 of  3689 million  increased  808 million  compared to 2011 primarily due to the recognition of a  492 million  noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our north american reporting unit a 200 million writeoff of unamortized cash retention awards following the decision to eliminate the repayment requirement of past awards and a 252 million expense related to the accrual for 2012 cash bonuses due to be paid in 2013 that do not feature a repayment requirement 

excluding these expenses total operating expenses declined 136 million or 5 percent principally due to 180 million expense recognised in 2011 related to the operational review and favorable movements in foreign exchange partially offset by increases in salary and benefits expenses linked to annual pay reviews new hires and investments in targeted businesses and geographies 

net loss attributable to willis shareholders from continuing operations was  446 million  or a loss of  258  per diluted share in 2012 compared to a profit of  203 million  or  115  per diluted share in 2011 the 649 million  decrease in net income compared to 2011 primarily reflects the increase in total expenses described above and the 113 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in our us operations partially offset by the nonrecurrence of the 131 million

posttax cost in 2011 relating to the makewhole amounts on the repurchase and redemption of 500 million of our senior debt and the writeoff of related unamortized debt issuance costs and by the revenue growth achieved during the year net income was also adversely impacted by a 7 million reduction in interest in earnings of associates net of tax mainly due to declining performance in our principal associate gras savoye 

2011  compared to 2010   

despite difficult market conditions total revenues in 2011 of 3447 million increased by 115 million or 3 percent compared to 2010 this included organic growth in commissions and fees of 2 percent driven by our international and global operations our north america operations reported a revenue decline of 4 percent including a 4 percent decline in organic commissions and fees reflecting lower revenues generated by loan protector and the continued adverse impact of difficult economic conditions in the us 

total expenses in 2011 of 2881 million increased 302 million compared to 2010 primarily due to incremental expense relating to the 2011 operational review a 22 million writeoff of an uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods prior to january 1 2011 discussed later in this section continued investment to support future growth increased incentives amortization relating to our cash retention awards reinstatement of salary reviews for all associates in march 2011 and 401k matching contributions for our us associates from january 2011 unfavorable foreign currency translation and an 11 million uk fsa regulatory settlement these increases were partially offset by cost savings arising from implementation of the 2011 operational review reduced pension expense of 24 million and the yearonyear 8 million benefit from the release of funds and reserves related to potential legal liabilities 

net income attributable to willis shareholders from continuing operations was 203 million or 115 per diluted share in 2011 compared to 455 million or 266 per diluted share in 2010 the 252 million reduction in net income compared to 2010 primarily reflects the increase in total expenses described above and the 131 million posttax cost relating to the makewhole amounts on the repurchase and redemption of 500 million of our senior debt and the writeoff of related unamortized debt issuance costs partly offset by revenue growth achieved during the year net income was also adversely impacted by an 11 million reduction in interest in earnings of associates net of tax mainly due to declining performance in our principal associate gras savoye 

adjusted operating income adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations 

adjusted operating income adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are calculated by excluding the impact of certain items as detailed below from operating income net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations respectively the most directly comparable gaap measures

we believe that excluding these items as applicable from operating income net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations provides a more complete and consistent comparative analysis of our results of operations we use these and other measures to establish group performance targets and evaluate the performance of our operations the company also uses both adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted operating margin measures to form the basis of establishing and assessing components of compensation 

as set out in the tables below adjusted operating margin at 216 percent  in 2012 was down 90  basis points compared to 2011 while adjusted net income from continuing operations at 454 million  was  28 million  lower than in 2011 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was 258  in 2012 compared to 274  in 2011

goodwill impairment 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2012 and concluded that an impairment charge was required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the companys north america reporting unit the goodwill impairment charge for the north america reporting unit amounted to 492 million there was no impairment for the global and international reporting units as the fair values of these units were significantly in excess of their carrying value 

correction of commissions and fees overstatement relating to 2011 and prior periods 

as previously disclosed in early 2012 we identified through our internal financial control process and a subsequent internal investigation an uncollectible accounts receivable balance of approximately 40 million in chicago from the fraudulent overstatement of commissions and fees from the years 2005 to 2011 

we concluded that the total 40 million of overstatement does not materially affect our previously issued financial statements for any of the prior periods and we corrected the misstatement by recognizing a charge to other operating expenses to write off the uncollectible receivable a of 13 million including legal expenses in the first quarter of 2012 and b of 22 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 in the fourth quarter 2011 we also reversed a 6 million balance of commissions and fees which had been recorded during 2011 and 2 million of salaries and benefits expense representing an overaccrual of production bonuses relating to the overstated revenue during 2012 we have recorded within other operating expenses a 10 million insurance settlement from insurers in respect of our claim under group insurance policies for compensation paid out in the years 2005 to 2010 on the fraudulently overstated revenues discussed above 

  

the employees in question who have been terminated were not members of willis executive management nor did they play a significant role in internal control over financial reporting based on the results of our investigation which has now been completed we do not believe that any client or carrier funds were misappropriated or that any other business units were affected 

we have enhanced our internal controls in relation to the business unit in question including enhanced procedures over receipt of checks and application of cash increased segregation of duties between the operating unit and the accounting and settlement function and additional central sign off requirement on revenue recognition 

headcount reduction 

in our initial assessment of the companys organizational design we have identified a number of positions that we can eliminate and leases we can exit to realize cost savings the assessment is ongoing but will be completed in the first quarter of 2013 and is expected to result in the elimination of approximately 200 fulltime positions 

as a result we expect to incur a pretax charge of approximately 35 million to 45 million in the first quarter of 2013 these actions are expected to deliver cost savings primarily through headcount reduction of approximately 20 million to 25 million in 2013 beginning in the second quarter and annualized cost savings of approximately 25 million to 30 million 

cash retention awards 

for the past several years certain cash retention awards under the companys annual incentive programs included a feature which required the recipient to repay a proportionate amount of the annual award if the employee voluntarily left the company before a specified date which was generally three years following the award as previously disclosed the company made the cash payment to the recipient in the year of grant and recognized the payment in expense ratably over the period it was subject to repayment beginning in the quarter in which the award was made the unamortized portion of cash retention awards was recorded within other current assets and other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

the following table sets out the amount of cash retention awards made and the related amortization of those awards for the three years ended december 31 2012 

business discussion 



 included within the 216 million  amortization of cash retention awards in 2012 is a 7 million allowance for amounts estimated to be uncollectible 

the remaining increase in amortization of cash retention awards of 24 million reflects the higher level of cash retention awards paid in 2012 compared to cash retention awards paid in 2009 which were fully amortized in 2011 

in december 2012 the company decided to eliminate the repayment requirement from past annual cash retention awards under the companys annual incentive plan and as a result recognized a onetime noncash pretax charge of 200 million  which represents the writeoff of the unamortized balance of past awards 

there were however a number of offcycle awards with a fixed period guarantee attached for which we have not waived the repayment requirement the unamortized portion of these awards amounted to 9 million at december 31 2012 

in addition the company has replaced annual cash retention awards with annual cash bonuses which will not include a repayment requirement the company has accrued an additional 252 million  within deferred revenue and accrued expenses for these 2012 cash bonuses to be paid in 2013 

as of december 31 2012  december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  we included 9 million  196 million  and 173 million  respectively within other current assets and other noncurrent assets on the balance sheet which represented the unamortized portion of cash retention award payments made on or before those dates 

pension expense 

we recorded a net pension credit on our uk defined benefit pension plan in 2012 of 5 million  2011 charge of 6 million  2010 charge of 28 million  on our us defined benefit pension plan we recorded a net pension charge of 3 million  in 2012 2011  nil  2010 1 million  on our international and us nonqualified defined benefit pension plans we recorded a net pension charge of  4 million  in 2012 2011 5 million  2010 6 million  

the movement from a 6 million charge on the uk plan in 2011 to a 5 million credit in 2012 was the result of higher asset returns and lower service cost reflecting certain changes to plan benefits partly offset by higher amortization of prior period losses and increased interest cost 

the 2011 uk plan charge was 22 million lower compared to 2010 as the benefits of higher asset returns lower amortization of prior period losses and a lower service cost reflecting certain changes to plan benefits were partly offset by an increased interest cost 

the us pension charge was 3 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011 reflecting increased asset return from a higher asset base being more than offset by an increase in amortization of prior period losses 

the 2011 us pension charge was 1 million lower compared with 2010 reflecting an increased asset return from a higher asset base partly offset by a reduction in amortization of prior period losses

willis group holdings plc 

consolidated results for 2012  compared to 2011   

revenues 

total revenues for the group and by segment for 2012 and 2011 are shown below millions except percentages 



 

 

our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited 

total revenues increased by 33 million  or 1 percent  in 2012 compared to 2011 including 3 percent  growth in organic commissions and fees partially offset by a 59 million or 2 percent  negative impact from foreign exchange and a 13 million decrease in investment income due to continued falling yields on deposits 

total commissions and fees were 3458 million  up 44 million or 1 percent from 3414 million  in 2011 foreign currency movements negatively impacted commissions and fees by 2 percent  organic commissions and fees growth was 3 percent  

new business growth was in the double digits and there were modest benefits in the year from improving rates in certain business lines and geographies these positive movements were however offset by a slight increase in lost business 

the global segment reported 5 percent  growth in commissions and fees comprising 6 percent  organic growth in commissions and fees and a 1 percent  negative impact from foreign currency translation organic commissions and fees growth of 6 percent  was led by high singledigit growth across reinsurance and willis faber  dumas global specialties reported low singledigit growth as strong growth from our marine energy financial solutions and construction specialties were partially offset by declines in aerospace which continues to be hampered by competitive pricing and a soft rate environment 

the north america segment reported a 1 percent  decline in organic commissions and fees compared to 2011 whilst new business levels were higher than in 2011 resulting in growth in certain regions and business segments these were more than offset by lower loan protector revenues the impact of the weakened economy which negatively impacted our construction and human capital practice groups and a modest decrease in client retention levels 

the international segment reported flat growth in commissions and fees compared with 2011 comprising 5 percent  organic commissions and fees growth and a 5 percent  negative impact from foreign currency translation organic growth in commissions and fees was led by doubledigit growth in our latin america region supported by high singledigit growth in asia and eastern europe our western europe operations reported low singledigit growth despite the continued weakness of economies within the eurozone 

business discussion 

our international and global segments earn a significant portion of their revenues in currencies other than the us dollar including the euro and pound sterling for 2012 our international segments reported revenues were adversely impacted by the net effects of foreign currency translation 

investment income in 2012 at 18 million  was 13 million  lower than in 2011 primarily due to declining net yields on cash and cash equivalents organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in operating results  segment information below 

salaries and benefits 

salaries and benefits increased by  388 million  or 19 percent  in 2012 compared with 2011 foreign currency movements lowered salaries and benefits by 34 million or 1 percent the yearonyear net favorable impact from foreign currency translation was driven primarily by the movement of the us dollar against the pound sterling in which our london market based operations incur the majority of their expenses 

excluding the impact of foreign exchange salaries and benefits increased by 422 million or 20 percent compared with 2011 primarily due to the 452 million expense recognized as a result of the change in remuneration policy for future incentive awards and the elimination of the repayment requirement on past awards an approximate 55 million increase in salaries including associated taxes and benefits resulting from new hires and annual pay reviews increases in incentives linked to production long term incentive plans and the amortization of cash retention awards these increases were partially offset by the 135 million expense recognized in salaries and benefits associated with the 2011 operational review and lower defined benefit pension plan expenses 

other expenses 

other operating expenses  were  75 million  or 12 percent  lower in 2012 compared with 2011 foreign currency movements positively impacted expenses by 35 million or 6 percent 

excluding the impact of foreign exchange other operating expenses decreased by 40 million or 6 percent compared with 2011 primarily due to the nonrecurrence of the 73 million expense recognized in other operating expenses associated with the 2011 operational review and the 10 million insurance recovery in 2012 related to the previously disclosed fraudulent activity partially offset by increases in certain other costs including provisioning for bad debts and higher technology expenditure 

depreciation expense  was 79 million  in 2012  compared with 74 million  in 2011  the increase is primarily due to a number of information technology related projects becoming operational at the end of 2011 and during first half 2012 partially offset by 5 million depreciation charge incurred in 2011 related to the operational review 

amortization of intangible assets  was 59 million  in 2012  a reduction of 9 million compared to 2011  the decrease primarily reflects the ongoing reduction in the hrh acquisitionrelated amortization 

goodwill impairment  charge was 492 million  in 2012 this was a noncash charge recognized related to the impairment of the carrying value of the north america reporting units goodwill for further information on our testing for goodwill impairment see critical accounting estimates below 

net loss on disposal of operations  of 3 million  was related principally to the dissolution of a joint venture operation in india and loss recognized on disposal of mauritian reinsurance operation 

interest expense 

interest expense was 128 million in 2012  compared to 156 million  in 2011  the decrease in interest expense primarily reflects the nonrecurrence of a 10 million writeoff of debt fees in 2011 related to the refinancing of the term loan and revolving credit facility and savings as a result of the lower coupon payable and reduced fee amortization on our new debt issued in march 2011 and december 2011 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on ordinary income for 2012 was 25 per cent compared with 24 per cent for 2011 with the increase driven primarily by higher than anticipated us state income tax expense the benefit from the higher tax rates at which costs associated with the 2011 operational review are relieved and from a different geographic mix of earnings the effective tax

interest in earnings of associates net of tax 

the majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of gras savoye the leading broker in france interest in earnings of associates net of tax in 2012  was 5 million  compared to 12 million  in 2011  the decline was mainly driven by a reduction in net income reported by our principal associate gras savoye 

similar to many businesses located in the eurozone gras savoyes operations are being pressured by the economic conditions in addition gras savoye recently appointed a new ceo and is undergoing a business review that is designed to drive growth in revenues and improve operational efficiencies

revenue increased by 115 million or 3 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 commissions and fees increased by 121 million or 4 percent including organic growth in commissions and fees of 2 percent which comprised 4 percent net new business growth driven by solid new business generation and higher retention of existing clients and a 2 percent negative impact from renewal fluctuations and other market factors 

there was a net 2 percent yearoveryear benefit to revenue growth from foreign currency translation driven by the weakening of the us dollar against a number of currencies in which we earn our revenues 

the 2 percent growth in organic commissions and fees comprised net growth in our segments 

 

 

 

investment income in 2011 at 31 million was 7 million lower than in 2010 as low interest rates across the globe in particular in the uk and us together with the rolloff of our interest rate hedge program continued to impact our investment income

other expenses 

other operating expenses  were 92 million or 16 percent higher in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily reflecting 40 million of additional expense associated with the 2011 operational review a 22 million writeoff of an uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods prior to january 1 2011 and the 11 million second quarter uk fsa regulatory settlement and increased expense in support of revenue growth initiatives these were partly offset by cost savings arising from implementation of the 2011 operational review the yearoveryear favorable comparison due to the 12 million 2010 charge relating to the devaluation of the venezuelan currency the 8 million yearoveryear benefit from the release of funds and reserves related to potential legal liabilities and positive yearoveryear foreign currency translation driven primarily by gains in 2011 on our forward rate hedging program compared to losses in 2010 

depreciation expense was 74 million in 2011 compared with 63 million in 2010 the increase primarily reflects accelerated depreciation expense of 5 million in 2011 relating to systems rationalization in connection with the 2011 operational review and depreciation of newly capitalized systems project costs in 2011 

amortization of intangible assets  was 68 million in 2011 a reduction of 14 million compared to 2010 the decrease primarily reflects the yearoveryear benefit of the 2010 amortization of the hrh noncompete agreement acquired in 2008 which was fully amortized in 2010 

makewhole on repurchase and redemption of senior notes and writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs

 2012  compared to 2011   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1124 million  were 51 million  or 5 percent  higher in 2012 compared with 2011 foreign exchange movements had a net 1 percent  impact on commissions and fees organic growth was 6 percent  

organic growth included positive growth across reinsurance global specialties willis faber  dumas and wcma as strong new business and higher oneoff transactions primarily in wcma were partially offset by increases in lost business 

organic growth in global specialties was led by strong performances from energy marine financial solutions and construction specialities reflecting singledigit net new business this growth was partially offset by declines in aerospace which continues to be negatively impacted by competitive pricing and rate decreases 

reinsurance reported midsingle digit growth in 2012 as growth in the international specialty and north america divisions was partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a fee related to a 2011 profitability initiative rates had a modest positive impact on commission and fees in the year 

willis faber  dumas also reported midsingle digit growth in 2012 

wcma is a transactionoriented business and its results are more variable than some of our other businesses in 2012 we reported significantly higher organic commissions and fees than in 2011 growth in the wcma business was positively impacted by a higher volume of advisory and catastrophe bond deals closing during the year 

client retention levels declined to 90 percent for 2012  compared with 91 percent for 2011  

operating margin 

operating margin was 329 percent   in 2012 and 325 percent  in 2011 the organic growth in commissions and fees discussed above and lower defined benefit pension costs were offset by higher salary and benefit expense due to the impact of annual salary increases and new hires higher production linked incentives and increases to discretionary costs 

2011  compared to 2010   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1073 million  were 86 million or 9 percent  higher in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting organic commissions and fees growth of 7 percent  and a net benefit from foreign currency translation of 2 percent organic growth included the benefit of net new business generation despite the adverse impact of the continued difficult economic environment and soft market in many of the specialty classes 

organic growth included positive growth across reinsurance global specialties willis faber  dumas and wcma businesses together with a 6 million first quarter 2011 benefit from a change in accounting within a global specialty business to conform to current group accounting policy 

organic growth in reinsurance in 2011 was led by growth in north america and asiapacific and included the benefit of new business growth and a profitability initiative that may or may not recur overall reinsurance showed stable pricing with modest increases in some lines and geographies particularly those affected by catastrophe losses 

organic growth in global specialties was led by strong contributions from marine energy financial solutions and aerospace reflecting good new business high retention levels targeted hiring of producer talent and connectivity between the retail network and specialty businesses however the operating environment remains challenging across most global specialty 

business discussion 

businesses with depressed world trade and transit volumes industry consolidation and pressure on financing of construction projects still evident 

willis faber  dumas reported positive organic commissions and fees growth in 2011 and our wcma business was marginally positive compared to 2010 

the 2 percent net benefit to revenue growth from foreign currency translation in 2011 primarily reflected the periodoverperiod positive impact of the weakening of the us dollar against both the euro and pound sterling in which we earn a significant portion of global revenues 

client retention levels improved to 91 percent for 2011 compared with 90 percent for 2010 

operating margin 

operating margin was 325 percent in 2011 compared to 321 percent in 2010 as the benefit of 7 percent organic commissions and fees growth discussed above and an 18 million decrease in pension expense was offset by a net negative impact from foreign currency movements an 8 million increase in incentive expense including amortization of cash retention award payments and the impact of costs associated with continued support of current and future growth 

operating margin is impacted by foreign exchange movements as the london market operations earn revenues in us dollars pounds sterling and euros and primarily incur expenses in pounds sterling in addition they are exposed to exchange risk on certain pound sterlingdenominated balances 

the periodoverperiod net negative impact from foreign currency movements in 2011 primarily reflected the increased us dollar value of our pound sterling expense base as a result of the weakening of the us dollar versus the pound sterling and the net negative impact of translation of nonusd assets and liabilities into us dollar in our london market operations these factors were partially offset by the us dollar weakening against the pound sterling and the euro increasing the us dollar value of our pound and euro denominated revenues

america legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the hrh acquisition and that had not been converted into higher standard commissions and v investment income and other income from reported revenues 

2012  compared to 2011   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1306 million  were 8 million  or 1 percent  lower in 2012 compared with 2011 legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the hrh acquisition amounted to 2 million  compared to 5 million  in 2011 

organic commissions and fees growth declined 1 percent  in 2012 compared with 2011 whilst new business levels were higher than in 2011 resulting in growth in certain regions and business segments these were more than offset by lower loan protector revenues and the impact of weakened economy 

the decline in the financial performance of our loan protector business had a 1 percent negative impact on north america organic growth in commissions and fees and for the full year 2011 and negatively impacted the segments revenue by 10 million the loan protector decline was driven by the loss of clients through attrition and ma activity industrywide commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures in the us in 2011 

client retention levels were 91 percent in 2012 consistent with 2011 

operating margin 

operating margin in north america was 183 percent  in 2012 compared with 205 percent  in 2011 reflecting the adverse impact from the 1 percent  decline in organic commissions and fees growth discussed above a 4 million  reduction in investment income due to declining yields and increases to incentive expenses and increased production linked awards and stock based compensation these were partly offset by a reduction to other expenses including lower premises costs and a reduction in eo provisions 

2011  compared to 2010   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1314 million were 55 million or 4 percent lower in 2011 compared with 2010 of which 6 million was attributable to the decrease in legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the hrh acquisition from 11 million in 2010 to 5 million in 2011 

organic commissions and fees growth declined 4 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 as the benefits of new business generation and growth in some regions were more than offset by declining loan protector revenues and the impact of the soft market conditions and weakened economy across most sectors 

the decline in the financial performance of our loan protector business had a 2 percent negative impact on north america organic growth in commissions and fees and for the full year 2011 negatively impacted the segments revenue by 27 million the loan protector decline was driven by the loss of clients through attrition and ma activity industrywide commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures in the us in 2011 

following the introduction of health care reform legislation in 2010 some major health insurance carriers in north america began to change their compensation practices in particular lines of business in certain locations in response to market pressures those changes caused we announced in july 2011 that in order to remain competitive we would begin accepting standard compensation based on volume but would continue to resist traditional contingent commissions and bonus payments because while legal we believe these forms of compensation create conflicts with our clients after several months of review under changing market conditions we have concluded that we cannot be fully competitive on human capital business if we continue to refuse these legal forms of compensation consequently we will begin to accept all forms of compensation from employee benefits providers effective april 1 2012 in north america 

client retention levels were 91 percent in 2011 compared to 92 percent in 2010 

business discussion 

operating margin 

operating margin in north america was 205 percent in 2011 compared with 231 percent in 2010 reflecting the adverse impact from the 4 percent decline in organic commissions and fees growth discussed above a periodoverperiod increase in 401k match expense of 10 million following its reinstatement in january 2011 and a 7 million increase in incentive expense including amortization of cash retention award payments these were partly offset by a 5 million decrease in stockbased compensation expense and the benefit of cost reductions driven by the 2011 operational review and continued focus on expense management 

international 

our international business comprises our retail operations in western europe central and eastern europe the united kingdom asia australasia the middle east south africa and latin america the services provided are focused according to the characteristics of each market and vary across offices but generally include direct risk management and insurance brokerage and employee benefits consulting 

the following table sets out revenues operating income organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended december 31 2012  in millions except percentages 



 

 2012  compared to 2011   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1028 million  were 1 million  higher in 2012 compared with 2011 foreign exchange movements had a 5 percent  negative impact on commissions and fees and organic commissions and fees growth was 5 percent  organic growth included double digit new business growth partly offset by slight increases to lost business rates and other market factors had no significant impact on commissions and fees in the year 

despite the ongoing economic difficulties faced by the eurozone our large retail operations in the region delivered low singledigit growth in 2012 driven by strong growth in germany sweden and denmark although this growth was partially offset by declines in ireland and norway 

our latin american operation delivered high doubledigit growth in 2012 the result of significant new business growth principally in brazil venezuela and argentina 

asia reported high singledigit growth in organic commissions and fees in 2012 led by strong growth in japan china and korea 

organic commissions and fees growth in our uk retail operation was flat in 2012 compared with 2011 this reflects a stabilization of the business in the region following a 2 percent decline in 2011 

willis group holdings plc 

a significant part of internationals revenues are earned in currencies other than the us dollar most notably the euro and australian dollar the net 5 percent  negative impact from foreign currency translation in 2012 primarily reflected the weakening of the us dollar against these and other currencies in which we earn international revenues 

client retention levels decreased to 93 percent for 2012 compared with 94 percent for 2011 

operating margin 

operating margin in international was 176 percent  in 2012 compared with 212 percent  in 2011 the decrease primarily reflected significant increases in salaries and benefits as a result of new hires supporting growth in targeted geographies and annual pay increases negative impact of foreign exchange on revenues and increases to certain provisions including bad debts these decreases were partly offset by the benefit from organic commissions and fees discussed above 

2011  compared to 2010   

revenues 

commissions and fees of 1027 million were 90 million or 10 percent higher in 2011 compared with 2010 comprising 5 percent organic growth and a net 5 percent positive impact from foreign currency translation organic growth included net new business growth of 7 percent partly offset by the negative impact from rates and other market factors 

there were strong contributions to 2011 organic commissions and fees growth from most regions including doubledigit growth in our latin america and eastern europe regions together with singledigit growth in asia and western europe in particular there was strong growth in brazil chile argentina russia and china 

the singledigit organic commissions and fees growth in our large retail operation in continental europe was primarily driven by strong growth in italy spain and germany despite the ongoing challenging economic conditions in this region offset by lower commissions and fees in denmark and the netherlands 

organic commissions and fees growth in our uk and ireland retail operations declined 2 percent in 2011 compared with the same period 2010 driven by the economic pressures that continue to affect both the uk and ireland 

a significant part of internationals revenues are earned in currencies other than the us dollar most notably the euro pound sterling and australian dollar the net 5 percent benefit from foreign currency translation in 2011 primarily reflected the weakening of the us dollar against these and other currencies in which we earn international revenues 

client retention levels increased to 94 percent for 2011 compared with 93 percent for 2010 

operating margin 

operating margin in international was 212 percent in 2011 compared with 238 percent in 2010 with the decrease primarily reflecting a 17 million increase in incentive expenses including amortization of cash retention award payments the impact of the reinstated annual salary review for all employees from april 2011 and increased spending on initiatives to drive future growth including investment hires these increases were partly offset by the benefit from organic commissions and fees growth and favorable foreign currency movements as discussed above and reduced pension expense 

business discussion 

corporate and other 

the company evaluates the performance of its segments based on organic commissions and fees growth and operating income for internal reporting and segmental reporting items for which segmental management are not held responsible for are held within ‘corporate and other’ 

corporate and other comprises the following in millions 



 

 the company concluded its internal investigation into these matters in the three months ended march 31 2012 and identified an additional 12 million in fraudulent overstatement of commissions and fees and has corrected the additional misstatement by recognizing a 13 million charge including legal expenses to other operating expenses in the first quarter of 2012 the above amount represents the additional charge taken

critical accounting estimates 

our accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our audit committee 

pension expense 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the us and uk both of these plans are now closed to new entrants and with effect from may 15 2009 we closed our us defined benefit plan to future accrual new employees in the uk are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the us are offered the opportunity to join a 401k plan we also have smaller defined benefit plans in ireland germany norway and the netherlands and a nonqualified plan in the us these schemes have combined total assets of 150 million  and a combined net liability for pension benefits of 30 million  as of december 31 2012  elsewhere pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans 

we recorded a 5 million  net pension credit on our uk defined benefit pension scheme and a net pension charge of 3 million  on our us defined benefit pension plans in 2012  compared with net pension charges of 6 million  and  nil  respectively in 2011  on our international defined benefit pension plans and us nonqualified plan we recorded a net pension charge of 4 million  in 2012  compared with 5 million  in 2011  

based on december 31 2012  assumptions except for the expected rate of return updated to 725 percent we expect the net pension credit in 2013  to be unchanged for the uk plan the net pension charge will decrease by 6 million for the us plan and be unchanged for the international plans 

we make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate the discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination our approach to determining appropriate assumptions for our uk and us pension plans is set out below 

uk plan 



 

 discount rate 

during 2012 we continued to use a durationbased approach which more closely matches the actual timing of expected cash flows to the applicable discount rate the selected rate used to discount uk plan liabilities in 2012 was 440  compared with 480  at december 31 2011  with the decrease reflecting falls in pound sterling highquality bond yields during 2012  

the lower discount rate generated an actuarial loss of approximately 186 million at december 31 2012  

expected and actual asset returns 

expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net uk pension expense in 

business discussion 

2012  was 750   2011  750  equivalent to an expected return in 2012  of 181 million  2011  161 million effective january 1 2013 the expected longterm rate of return was decreased to 725 the decrease in the expected longterm rate of return followed a change in the underlying target asset mix which reflects the expected commencement in 2013 of the derisking strategy proposed by the trustees which will lead to a strategic target asset allocation with a greater weighting to nonreturn seeking assets 

the expected and actual returns on uk plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2012  were as follows 



mortality 

the mortality assumption used during 2012 is the 90105 pna00 table for males  females unchanged from the assumptions used during 2011 

as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a uk male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2012  would have a life expectancy of 24 years 

us plan 



 

 discount rate 

the discount rate at december 31 2012  was 407  a reduction of 56 basis points from the discount rate of 463  at december 31 2011  the fall in the discount rate reflects declining highquality corporate bond yields during 2012 

the impact of the lower discount rate in 2012  increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 71 million 

expected and actual asset returns 

the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net us pension scheme expense in 2012  was 725 a reduction of 025 from 2011  

the expected and actual returns on us plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2012  were as follows 

willis group holdings plc 



mortality 

the mortality assumption at december 31 2012  is the rp2000 mortality table blended for annuitants and nonannuitants projected by scale aa to 2020 for annuitants and 2028 for nonannuitants  december 31 2011  projected by scale aa to 2019 for annuitants and 2027 for nonannuitants 

as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a us male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2012  would have a life expectancy of 19 years 

intangible assets 

intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of businesses acquired we classify our intangible assets into three categories 

 client relationships acquired on the hrh acquisition are amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected to be consumed over 80 of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized after 10 years noncompete agreements acquired in connection with the hrh acquisition were amortized over two years on a straight line basis intangible assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis goodwill is not subject to amortization 

we review purchased intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the purchased intangible assets with finite lives are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value 

goodwill impairment review 

we test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 

the goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis step one requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its carrying value if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform step two step two requires the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to be compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit 

business discussion 

determination of reporting units 

we have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments north america international and global goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the reporting units 

fair value of reporting units 

the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and in aggregate validated against our market capitalization 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include estimations of future cash flows which are dependent on internal forecasts longterm rate of growth for our business and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain therefore changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and result in goodwill impairment 

in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

annual goodwill impairment analysis 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2012 and concluded that an impairment charge was required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the companys north america reporting unit the goodwill impairment charge for the north america reporting unit amounted to 492 million there was no impairment for the global and international reporting units as the fair values of these units were significantly in excess of their carrying value 

under the income approach the fair value of the north america reporting unit was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the fair value measurements used unobservable inputs in a discounted cash flow model based on the companys most recent forecasts such projections were based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows with consideration of market comparables where appropriate the discount rate was based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with market participant expectations of characteristics of the individual reporting units 

as the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value the second step of the impairment test was performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss in the second step the north america reporting units fair value was allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets the fair value of intangible assets associated with the north america reporting unit included customer relationship intangible assets which were valued using a multiple period excess earnings approach involving discounted future projections of associated revenue streams 

the decline in the fair value of the north america reporting unit as well as differences between fair values and carrying values for other assets and liabilities in the second step of the goodwill impairment test resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill substantially below the carrying value of the goodwill for the reporting unit as a result the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 492 million 

as previously disclosed the north america reporting unit has been hampered by the declining loan protector business results the effect of the soft economy in the us which has significantly impacted the construction and human capital sectors and declining retention rates primarily related to ma activity and lost legacy hrh business 

the decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit resulted from lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as well as an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows the increase in the discount rate was due to increases in the riskfree rate and small company premium offset by a reduction to the expected market rate of return the lower projected profitability levels reflect changes in assumptions related to organic revenue growth and cost rates which can be attributed to the declines discussed above and also includes consideration of the uncertainty related to the businesss ability to execute on the projected cash flows

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards we estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies 

at december 31 2012  we had gross deferred tax assets of 451 million   2011  432 million  against which a valuation allowance of 221 million   2011  102 million  had been recognized to the extent that 

 we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income 

positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities the benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts the company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions in 2012  there was a net increase in uncertain tax positions of 21 million compared to a net increase of 3 million in 2011  the company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

we purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly over recent years we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice

new accounting standards 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board ‘fasb’ issued new guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that fair value measurements and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ‘ifrs’ the guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued new guidance to revise the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements requiring that the components of comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income oci or when an item of oci must be reclassified to net income 

asu no 201105 also requires entities to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented in december 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201112 in order to defer those changes in asu no 201105 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments in february 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive asu 201302 this guidance is the culmination of the fasbs deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income aoci the amendments in asu 201302 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income but do require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of aoci in its entirety by component on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income must be crossreferenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail this standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2012 the company is evaluating the effect the adoption of asu 201302 will have on its consolidated financial statements effective from first quarter 2013 

in september 2011 the fasb also issued guidance to allow an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 

all of the above accounting changes became effective for the company from first quarter 2012

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

financial risk management 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 — basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements and further disclosure is provided in note 26 — derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

foreign exchange risk management 

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the united states we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling 

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2012  



 

i in 2012 the proportion of expenses incurred in pounds sterling was lower than in 2011 as a result of increased us dollar expenses primarily due to the impact of the goodwill impairment charge 

our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from 

 london market operations 

in our london market operations we earn revenue in a number of different currencies principally us dollars pounds sterling euros and japanese yen but incur expenses almost entirely in pounds sterling 

we hedge this risk as follows 

 however where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit we do not hedge the risk consequently if our london market operations have a significant pension asset or liability we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the us dollar and pounds sterling exchange rate changes we do however hedge the pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan 

translation risk 

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange 

willis group holdings plc 

rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower 

with the exception of foreign currency hedges for certain intercompany loans that are not designated as hedging instruments we do not hedge translation risk 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within three years 





 

 income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the uk is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities 

interest rate risk management 

our operations are financed principally by 2050 million fixed rate senior notes issued by the group and 289 million under a 5year term loan facility of the fixed rate senior notes 350 million are due 2015 300 million are due 2016 600 million are due 2017 300 million are due 2019 and 500 million are due 2021 the 5year term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments and a final repayment of 225 million is due in the fourth quarter of 2016 as of december 31 2012  we had access to 522 million under three revolving credit facilities and as at this date no amount was outstanding under those facilities the interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown 

we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in both us dollars and pounds sterling 

market risk 

as a result of our operating activities we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies we earn interest on these funds which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which it may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity in order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets we entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest in the various currencies related to the shortterm investments the use of interest rate contracts essentially converted groups of shortterm variable rate investments to fixed rates however in the fourth quarter of 2011 we stopped renewing hedged positions on their maturity given the flat yield curve environment further to this during second quarter 2012 the company closed out its legacy position for these interest rate swap contracts 

during the year ended december 31 2010 the company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of 350 million to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semiannual basis with a maturity date of july 15 2015 the company has designated and accounts for these instruments as fair value hedges against its 350 million 5625 senior notes due 2015 the fair values of the interest rate swaps are included within other assets or other liabilities and the fair value of the hedged element of the senior notes is included within the principal amount of the debt 

the table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for interest rate swaps the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts the duration of interest rate swaps varied between one and five years with refixing periods of three to six months average fixed and variable rates are respectively the weightedaverage actual and market rates for the interest rate hedges in place market rates are the rates prevailing at december 31 2012  or 2011  as appropriate 



willis group holdings plc 



  

 

 liquidity risk 

our objective is to ensure we have the ability to generate sufficient cash either from internal or external sources in a timely and costeffective manner to meet our commitments as they fall due our management of liquidity risk is embedded within our overall risk management framework scenario analysis is continually undertaken to ensure that our resources can meet our liquidity requirements these resources are supplemented by access to 522 million under three revolving credit facilities we undertake shortterm foreign exchange swaps for liquidity purposes 

see ‘liquidity’ section under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

credit risk and concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the company currently does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties the company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk however it is the companys policy to enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties as practical 

concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value 

the company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure these financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies 

market risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the company does business as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the companys concentrations of credit as of december 31 2012

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012  based on the criteria related to internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on our evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2012

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of willis group holdings public limited company and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2012  based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012  based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2012  of the company and our report dated february 28 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

as part of our ongoing strategy we continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our international market share through acquisitions and strategic investments a list of significant subsidiaries is included in exhibit 211 to this document 

 

we have also invested in associate companies our significant associates at december 31 2011 were gs  cie groupe ‘gras savoye’ a french organization 30 percent holding and alfuttaim willis co llc organized under the laws of dubai 49 percent holding in connection with many of our investments we retain the right to increase our ownership over time typically to a majority or 100 percent ownership position in addition in certain instances our coshareholders have a right typically based on some price formula of revenues or earnings to put some or all of their shares to us on december 17 2009 as part of a reorganization of the share capital of gras savoye our interest in that company reduced from 48 percent to 31 percent in 2011 our ownership reduced further to 30 percent following issuance of additional share capital as part of an employee share incentive scheme in addition we have the option to acquire a 100 percent interest in the capital of gras savoye in 2015 for further information on the gras savoye capital reorganization see ‘item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 14 — investments in associates’ 

 

we believe the combined total revenues of our international subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread and capability of our international network the team generated over 30 percent of the group’s total consolidated commissions and fees in 2011 

 

customers 

 

our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational corporations to middlemarket companies further many of our client relationships span decades for instance our relationship with the tokio marine and fire insurance company limited dates back over 100 years no one client accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues for fiscal year 2011 additionally we place insurance with approximately 5000 insurance carriers none of which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2011 

 

competition 

 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price according to the directory of agents and brokers published by business insurance in july 2011 the 140 largest commercial insurance brokers globally reported brokerage revenues totaling 42 billion in 2010 of which 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

marsh  mclennan companies inc had approximately 25 percent aon corporation had approximately 25 percent and willis had approximately 8 percent 

 

we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two other providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and the other two providers of global risk management services have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers many insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

 

in 2005 we along with marsh  mclennan and aon agreed with new york state and other regulators through an assurance of discontinuance to implement certain business reforms which included codification of our october 2004 voluntary termination of contingent commission arrangements with insurers most other special regional and local insurance brokers however continued to accept contingent compensation and did not disclose the compensation received in connection with providing policy placement services to its customers in february 2010 we entered into an amended and restated assurance of discontinuance with the attorney general of the state of new york and the amended and restated stipulation with the superintendent of insurance of the state of new york which ended many of the requirements previously imposed upon us the new agreement no longer limited the type of compensation we could receive and simplified our compensation disclosure requirements 

 

following the introduction of health care reform legislation in 2010 some major health insurance carriers in north america began to change their compensation practices in particular lines of business in certain locations in response to market pressures those changes caused we announced in july 2011 that in order to remain competitive we would begin accepting standard compensation based on volume but would continue to resist traditional contingent commissions and bonus payments because while legal we believe these forms of compensation create conflicts with our clients after several months of review under changing market conditions we have concluded that we cannot be fully competitive on employee benefits business if we continue to refuse these legal forms of compensation consequently we will begin to accept all forms of compensation from employee benefits providers effective april 1 2012 while accepting contingent compensation is legal and while we will only accept them in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and consistent with ethical business practices in the past it has been the subject of regulatory action and civil litigation and we cannot predict whether our position will cause regulatory or other scrutiny 

 

we will continue to refuse to accept contingent commissions from carriers in the nonemployee benefit areas of our retail brokerage business unless similar external factors such as legislative change make our position untenable however we do not believe such a change is likely to our knowledge we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance we seek to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to our clients and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of valueadded risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities although we continue to believe in the success of our strategy we cannot be certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable organic commissions and fees growth if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors who are accepting or may accept contingent commissions we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

regulation 

 

our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasigovernmental regulatory supervision in virtually all countries in which we operate also such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities while these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria our three most significant regulatory regions are described below 

 

about willis 

 

united states 

 

our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the united states are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction insurance laws in the united states are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions 

 

european union 

 

the european union insurance mediation directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the eu on a basis consistent with the eu single market and customer protection aims each eu member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence good repute professional indemnity cover and financial capacity 

 

united kingdom 

 

in the united kingdom the statutory body is the financial services authority ‘fsa’ the fsa has prescribed the methods by which our insurance and reinsurance operations are to conduct business and has a wide range of rulemaking investigatory and enforcement powers aimed at meeting its overall aim of promoting efficient orderly and fair markets and helping retail consumers achieve a fair deal the fsa conducts monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements 

 

certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment and securities licensing authorities in the united states our willis capital markets  advisory business operates through our whollyowned subsidiary willis securities inc a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member finrasipc primarily in connection with investment bankingrelated services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions willis capital markets provides advice on securities or investments in the eu through our whollyowned subsidiary willis capital markets  advisory limited which is authorized and regulated by the fsa 

 

our failure or that of our employees to satisfy the regulators that we comply with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities can result in disciplinary action fines reputational damage and financial harm 

 

all companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the united states and united kingdom we do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position 

 

see part i item 1arisk factors ‘legal and regulatory risks’ for discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 17000 employees worldwide of whom approximately 3400 were employed in the united kingdom and 6200 in the united states with the balance being employed across the rest of the world in addition our associates had approximately 3300 employees all of whom were located outside the united kingdom and the united states

 item 1a—risk factors 

 

risks relating to our business and the insurance industry 

 

this section describes material risks affecting the group’s business these risks could materially affect the group’s business its revenues operating income net income net assets liquidity and capital resources and ability to achieve its financial targets and accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k 

 

competitive risks 

 

worldwide economic conditions including those associated with the current eurozone sovereign debt crisis could have an adverse effect on our business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

our business and operating results are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions current global economic conditions including those associated with the current eurozone sovereign debt crisis coupled with declining customer and business confidence increasing energy prices and other challenges may have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from these conditions for example our employee benefits practice may be adversely affected as businesses continue to downsize during this period of economic turmoil and our construction business may be adversely affected by the lack of new construction our north american and uk and irish retail operations have been particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market from 2009 through 2011 with no material improvement in rates across most sectors the global economic downturn is negatively affecting some of the international economies that have supported the strong growth in our international operations 

 

a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business while it is difficult to predict consequences of any further deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the potential for a significant insurer to fail be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients 

 

the credit and economic conditions within certain european union countries in particular greece ireland italy portugal and spain have continued to deteriorate and have contributed to the instability in the global credit and financial markets while the outcome of these events cannot be predicted it is possible that such events could have a negative effect on the global economy as a whole and our business operating results and financial condition if the european debt crisis continues or further deteriorates there will likely be a negative effect on our european business which constitutes approximately 40 percent of our business in terms of revenue as well as the businesses of our european clients if the euro dissolved entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time a significant devaluation of the euro would cause the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros to be significantly reduced any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business prospects operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

in light of the current global economic uncertainty we strive to vigorously manage our cost base in order to fund further growth initiatives while we completed an operational review and commenced certain revenue generating initiatives in 2011 such as sales 20 willplace and global solutions we cannot be certain whether we will be able to realize benefits from these initiatives or any new initiatives that we may implement 

 

risk factors 

 

we do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability 

 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services we do not determine insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions for a threeyear period in early 2000s we benefitted from a ‘hard’ market with premium rates stable or increasing since that time we saw a rapid transition from a hard market to a ‘soft’ market with premium rates falling in most markets which impacted our commission revenues and operating margin in 2009 the stabilization of rates in the reinsurance market and some specialty markets was offset by the continuing soft market in other sectors and the adverse impact of the weakened economic environment across the globe our north american and uk and irish retail operations have been particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market from 2009 through 2011 with no material improvement in rates across most sectors this resulted in declines in 2009 revenues in these operations with a modest improvement in 2010 followed by declines in 2011 particularly amongst our smaller clients who have been especially vulnerable to the economic downturn 

 

in addition as traditional riskbearing insurance carriers continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated agents or brokers such as ourselves those insurance carriers may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

 

competition in our industry is intense and if we are unable to compete effectively we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two other providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market and the other two providers of global risk management services have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers many insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buy insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services

willis group holdings plc 

 

consistent with ethical business practices in the past it has been the subject of regulatory action and civil litigation and we cannot predict whether our position will cause regulatory or other scrutiny 

 

we will continue to refuse to accept contingent commissions from carriers in the nonemployee benefit areas of our retail brokerage business unless similar external factors such as legislative change make our position untenable however we do not believe such a change is likely to our knowledge we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance we seek to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to our clients and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of valueadded risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities although we continue to believe in the success of our strategy we cannot be certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable organic revenue growth if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors who are accepting or may accept contingent commissions we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

dependence on key personnel — the loss of our chairman and chief executive officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives 

 

the loss of our chairman and chief executive officer a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our chairman and chief executive officer joseph j plumeri and other members of our senior management but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships the insurance and reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand train and manage our employee base we may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense 

 

legal and regulatory risks 

 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states the united kingdom and the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate indeed over the last few years there has been a general increase in focus and developments in these laws and regulations compliance with laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include insurance industry regulations economic and trade sanctions and laws against financial crimes such as money laundering bribery or other corruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies fines injunctions revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients 

 

given the increased interest expressed by us and uk regulators in the effectiveness of compliance controls relating to financial crime in our market sector in particular we began a voluntary internal review of our policies and controls five years ago this review includes analysis and advice from external experts on best practices review of public regulatory decisions and discussions with government regulators in the us and uk in addition the uk fsa conducted an investigation of willis limited’s our uk brokerage subsidiary compliance systems and controls between 2005 and 2009 on july 21 2011 we and the fsa announced a settlement under which the fsa concluded its investigation by assessing a £7 million 11 million fine on willis limited for lapses in its implementation and documentation of its controls to counter the risks of improper payments being made to nonfsa authorized overseas third parties engaged to help win business particularly in high risk jurisdictions 

 

risk factors 

 

as a result of the fsa settlement we are conducting a further internal review of all payments made between 2005 and 2009 we also continue to fully cooperate with our us regulators however we are unable to predict at this time when our discussions with them will be concluded we do not believe that this further internal review or our discussions with the us regulators will result in any material fines or sanctions but there can be no assurance that any resolution will not have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business in certain jurisdictions while we believe that our current systems and controls are adequate and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of applicable laws and regulations 

 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings 

 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist our clients with matters including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims involving substantial amounts of money errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question 

 

claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include allegations of damages for our employees or subagents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis errors and omissions claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly in recent years in respect of selfinsured risks we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience 

 

we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims an example of material claims for which we are subject that are outside of the error and omissions claims context relate to those arising out of the collapse of the stanford financial group for which we acted as brokers of record on certain lines of insurance 

 

the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may also be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships 

 

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing systems or data security breaches could cause material financial loss loss of human resources regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and to develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs 

 

if the information we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer applications or software systems or if we experience other disruptions this could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability 

 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located this may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information in our database however we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we maintain in our databases and protect it from theft computer viruses hackers or inadvertent loss in such circumstances we may be held liable to our clients which could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue further database privacy identity theft and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace 

 

financial risks 

 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility 

 

we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 24 billion as of december 31 2011 and our 2011 interest expense was 156 million although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may

risk factors 

 

 

  

the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments 

 

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our pension liabilities may increase which could require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans reducing the cash available for other uses 

 

we have two principal defined benefit plans one in the united kingdom and the other in the united states and in addition we have several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which we operate cash contributions of approximately 142 million will be required in 2012 for these pension plans although we may elect to contribute more total cash contributions to these defined benefit pension plans in 2011 were 135 million future estimates are based on certain assumptions including discount rates interest rates mortality fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets 

 

in early 2012 we provisionally agreed a revised funding strategy with the uk plan’s trustee whilst the proposed new funding strategy has not been definitively agreed at the date of this report we expect this to occur by the end of march 2012 and we expect the cash contributions to the scheme in 2012 to be approximately equal to those in 2011 

 

we have taken actions to manage our pension liabilities including closing our uk and us plans to new participants and restricting final pensionable salaries future benefit accruals in the us pension plan were also stopped or frozen on may 15 2009 nevertheless the determination of pension expense and pension funding is based on a variety of rules and regulations changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets they may also result in higher pension costs additional financial statement disclosure and accelerate and increase the need to fully fund our pension plans through increased cash contributions further a significant decline in the value of investments that fund our pension plan if not offset or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities may significantly alter the values and actuarial assumptions used to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required to fund our plan with significant additional amounts of cash in addition to the critical assumptions described above our plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan participants and surviving spouses periodic revision of those assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pension expense changes in our pension benefit obligations the related net periodic costs or credits and the required level of future cash contributions may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees the need to make additional cash contributions may reduce the company’s financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or other needs of our business 

 

we could incur substantial losses including with respect to our own cash and fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies and clients if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations failed 

 

the deterioration of the global credit and financial markets has created challenging conditions for financial institutions including depositories as the fallout from the credit crisis persists the financial strength of these institutions may continue to decline we maintain significant cash balances at various us depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the us federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits we also maintain significant cash balances in 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

foreign financial institutions a significant portion of this fiduciary cash is held on behalf of insurance companies or clients if one or more of the institutions in which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses we could also be liable to claims made by the insurance companies or our clients regarding the fiduciary cash held on their behalf 

 

a downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility 

 

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility in addition certain downgrades would trigger a stepup in interest rates under the indentures for our 62 senior notes due 2017 and our 70 senior notes due 2019  which would increase our interest expense if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources this may in turn impact the assumptions when performing our goodwill impairment testing which may reduce the excess of fair value over carrying value of the reporting units 

 

we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses or reorganization of existing investments 

 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we may acquire or dispose of or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate opportunities negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions once we complete acquisitions or reorganizations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction including revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies for example if we fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from a transaction goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired in future periods in addition we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies which may impact our results of operations if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce overheads related to the divested assets we also own an interest in a number of associates such as gras savoye where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we can achieve through full integration 

 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

 

willis group holdings is organized as a holding company that conducts no business of its own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and make other payments to willis group holdings we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on ordinary shares 

 

if our goodwill becomes impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings 

 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 

 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit a significant deterioration 

 

risk factors 

 

in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings 

 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at october 1 at october 1 2011 our analysis showed the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value and therefore did not result in an impairment charge 2010 nil 2009 nil the fair values of the global and international reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values the fair value of the north american unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14 percent 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 our north america segment continued to be hampered by declining loan protector business results the effect of the soft economy in the us and declining retention rates primarily related to ma activity and lost legacy hrh business consequently the annual impairment test described above included additional sensitivity analysis over and above that we would usually perform in relation to our north america segment’s goodwill impairment review this additional analysis included reductions to assumed rates of revenue growth increases to assumed rates of expense growth and flexing the assumed weighted average cost of capital although our testing concluded there is no impairment the analysis indicated that in respect of the north america segment in the event of either a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of part of the reporting unit there could be an impairment to the carrying value in future periods 

 

for further information on our testing for goodwill impairment see ‘critical accounting estimates’ under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

international risks 

 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the united states accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside the united states and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency the table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2011 

 

 

 

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses together with any net sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollar denominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure 

 

for example as the pound sterling strengthens the us dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase which then causes our results to be negatively impacted however any net sterling asset we 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

are holding will be more valuable when translated into us dollars given these facts the strength of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results this risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations in the future 

 

where possible we hedge part of our operating exposure to exchange rate movements but such mitigating attempts may not be successful 

 

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries 

 

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets the possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses these risks include 

 

  

legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us and our effective tax rate may increase 

 

there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate which include the potential legislative actions described below and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate for example legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which we rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions including the us we could be subjected to increased taxation in addition any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased taxation 

 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing 

 

risk factors 

 

for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not be directly enforceable in ireland while not directly enforceable it is possible for a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability to be enforced in ireland through common law rules however this process is subject to numerous established principles and would involve the commencement of a new set of proceedings in ireland to enforce the judgment 

 

as an irish company willis group holdings is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of willis group holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

 

our noncore operations pose certain underwriting advisory or reputational risks and can have such as our loan protector business a significant adverse impact on our financial results 

 

we provide a broad range of brokerage reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide we also engage in certain noncore operations for example our willis capital markets  advisory business provides advice to insurance and reinsurance companies on a broad array of mergers and acquisition transactions as well as capital markets products including acting as underwriter or agent for primary issuances operating a secondary insurancelinked securities trading desk and engaging in general capital markets and strategic advisory work these operations may pose certain underwriting advisory or reputational risks to our core business 

 

in addition these noncore operations although not material to the group as a whole may in any period have a material effect on our results of operations for example our willis capital markets  advisory business is transactionbased which can cause results to differ from periodtoperiod in addition our financial results in 2011 were adversely impacted by the significant deterioration of the financial results of our loan protector business driven by the loss of clients through attrition and ma activity industrywide commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures

there are no governmental laws decrees or regulations in ireland which will restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to nonresident holders of the company’s shares 

 

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the us should be exempted from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends an exception to this position applies where a shareholder holds shares in the company through a branch or agency in ireland through which a trade is carried on 

 

with respect to noncorporate us shareholders certain dividends received before january 1 2011 from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states such as our shares noncorporate us shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as ‘investment income’ pursuant to section 163d4 of the code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation in addition the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances

executive summary 

 

business overview 

 

we provide a broad range of insurance broking risk management and consulting services to our clients worldwide and organize our business into three segments global north america and international 

 

our global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide arising from specific industries and activities including aerospace energy marine construction financial and executive risks fine art jewelry and specie special contingency risks and reinsurance 

 

north america and international comprise our retail operations and provide services to small medium and large corporations and the employee benefits practice our largest productbased practice group provides health welfare and human resources consulting and brokerage services 

 

in our capacity as advisor and insurance broker we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements helping clients determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network 

 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations 

 

due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods a period of low or declining premium rates generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin a ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market during which premium rates rise generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin 

 

market conditions 

 

the years 2005 through 2010 were almost universally viewed as soft market years across most of our product offerings and our commission revenues and operating margins throughout that period were negatively impacted although in 2009 the market experienced modest stabilization in the reinsurance market and certain specialty markets 

 

our north america and uk and irish retail operations were particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market throughout 2009 and 2010 with no material improvement in rates across most sectors in these geographic regions this resulted in declines in revenues in these operations particularly amongst our smaller clients who have been especially vulnerable to the economic downturn 

 

in 2011 we saw some modest increases in catastropheexposed property insurance and reinsurance pricing levels driven by significant 2011 catastrophe losses including the japanese earthquake and tsunami the new zealand earthquake the 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

midwest us tornadoes and thailand floods however in general we continued to be negatively impacted by the soft insurance market and challenging economic conditions across other sectors and most geographic regions 

 

we believe that in the absence of a significant catastrophe loss or capital impairment in the industry a universal turn in market rates is not likely to occur however more recently we have not seen the same reduction in rates globally that were faced in early 2011 and during 2010 and 2009 there have been recent signs that the unprofitability of certain business lines such as property catastrophe and workers compensation is slowly firming rates in those lines additionally there has been some evidence of firming or hardening in certain sectors of the reinsurance market in early 2012 

 

financial performance 

 

general 

 

this discussion includes references to nongaap financial measures as defined in regulation g of the rules of the securities and exchange commission ‘sec’ we present such nongaap financial measures specifically organic growth in commissions and fees adjusted operating margin adjusted operating income adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the company’s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis organic growth in commissions and fees excludes the impact of acquisitions and disposals year over year movements in foreign exchange legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the hrh acquisition and investment and other income from growth in revenues and commissions and fees adjusted operating margin adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are calculated by excluding the impact of certain specified items from net income from continuing operations the most directly comparable gaap measure these financial measures should be viewed in addition to not in lieu of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011 

 

consolidated financial performance 

 

2011 compared to 2010 

 

despite difficult market conditions total revenues in 2011 of 3447 million increased by 115 million or 3 compared to 2010 this included organic growth in commissions and fees of 2 driven by our international and global operations our north america operations reported a revenue decline of 4 including a 4 decline in organic commissions and fees reflecting lower revenues generated by loan protector a specialty business acquired as part of the hrh business and the continued adverse impact of difficult economic conditions in the us 

 

total expenses in 2011 of 2881 million increased 302 million compared to 2010 primarily due to incremental expense relating to the 2011 operational review discussed later in this section a 22 million writeoff of an uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods prior to january 1 2011 also discussed later in this section continued investment to support future growth increased incentives amortization relating to our cash retention awards reinstatement of salary reviews for all associates in march 2011 and 401k matching contributions for our us associates from january 2011 unfavorable foreign currency translation and an 11 million uk fsa regulatory settlement these increases were partially offset by cost savings arising from implementation of the 2011 operational review reduced pension expense of 24 million and the yearonyear 8 million benefit from the release of funds and reserves related to potential legal liabilities 

 

net income attributable to willis shareholders from continuing operations was 203 million or 115 per diluted share in 2011 compared to 455 million or 266 per diluted share in 2010 the 252 million reduction in net income compared to 2010 primarily reflects the increase in total expenses described above and the 131 million posttax cost relating to the makewhole amounts on the repurchase and redemption of 500 million of our senior debt and the writeoff of related unamortized debt issuance costs partly offset by revenue growth achieved during the year net income was also adversely impacted by an 11 million reduction in interest in earnings of associates net of tax mainly due to declining performance in our principal associate gras savoye 

 

business discussion 

 

2010 compared to 2009 

 

total revenues in 2010 of 3332 million increased by 79 million or 2 compared to 2009 reflecting organic growth in commissions and fees of 4 being partly offset by a 1 adverse impact from foreign currency translation and decreased investment and other income total expenses in 2010 of 2579 million were 16 million higher compared to 2009 salaries and benefits expense increased by 46 million primarily due to a 60 million increase in incentive expense partly offset by reduced severance costs and favorable foreign currency translation other operating expenses declined by 26 million driven by reduced losses on our forward hedging program and a reduction in the amortization of intangible assets of 18 million due to a lower amortization charge for hrhrelated intangibles 

 

net income attributable to willis shareholders from continuing operations was 455 million or 266 per diluted share in 2010 compared to 434 million or 257 per diluted share in 2009 the 21 million increase in net income compared to 2009 primarily reflects the revenue growth described above partly offset by the 16 million increase in total expenses an increase in the effective tax rate from 18 in 2009 to 24 in 2010 and a 10 million reduction in interest in earnings of associates net of tax following the december 2009 reduction from 49 to 31 in our ownership interest in gras savoye 

 

adjusted operating income adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations 

 

adjusted operating income adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are calculated by excluding the impact of certain items from operating income and net income from continuing operations respectively the most directly comparable gaap measures we believe that excluding these items as applicable from operating income and net income from continuing operations provides a more complete and consistent comparative analysis of our results of operations we use these and other measures to establish group performance targets and evaluate the performance of our operations the company also uses both adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted operating margin measures to form the basis of establishing and assessing components of compensation as set out in the tables below adjusted operating margin at 225 in 2011 was down 50 basis points compared to 2010 while adjusted net income from continuing operations at 482 million was 12 million higher than in 2010 and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was 274 in 2011 compared to 275 in 2010 

 

a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to reported operating income the most directly comparable gaap measure is as follows in millions except percentages

2011 operational review 

 

in order to fund the higher anticipated salaries and benefits expense and continued investment for the future we implemented a review of all our businesses in 2011 to better align our resources with our growth strategies in connection with this review we incurred pretax charges of 180 million in 2011 including 

 

 32 

 

business discussion 

 

 

the full year cost of the 2011 operational review at 180 million represents an increase of 20 million from our third quarter 2011 estimate this is the result of the identification of additional opportunities to achieve efficiencies 

 

in 2011 we realized total cost savings attributable to the 2011 operational review of approximately 80 million we now expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately 135 million beginning in 2012 an increase from our previous estimate of 115 million to 125 million and represents incremental savings in 2012 compared to 2011 of approximately 55 million 

 

the statements under ‘2011 operational review’ constitute forwardlooking statements please see ‘forwardlooking statements’ for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements 

 

makewhole on repurchase and redemption of senior notes and writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs 

 

we issued 800 million of new debt in march 2011 comprised of 300 million 4125 senior notes due 2016 and 500 million 5750 senior notes due 2021 net proceeds of approximately 787 million were used in part to repurchase and redeem 500 million 12875 senior notes due 2016 and make related makewhole payments totaling 158 million in addition to the makewhole payment we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of 13 million 

 

correction of commissions and fees overstatement relating to 2011 and prior periods 

 

in the first quarter of 2012 we identified through our internal financial control process an uncollectible accounts receivable balance of approximately 28 million in a standalone business unit that appears to be due to fraudulent overstatements of commissions and fees from the years 2005 to 2011 this matter was brought to management’s attention after we had announced our fourth quarter and annual earnings on february 14 2012 

 

the company is conducting an internal investigation into this matter with the assistance of our professional advisors based on the results of the investigation to date we believe that the overstatements resulted from the conduct of a few associates within or dealing with our employee benefits group who colluded to misapply certain current cash receipts to older outstanding accounts receivable balances we have concluded that the overstatements we uncovered did not materially affect our previouslyissued financial statements for any of the prior periods 

 

for the year ended december 31 2011 we have corrected the misstatement of commissions and fees from prior periods by recognizing a 22 million charge to other operating expenses to write off the uncollectible receivable at january 1 2011 and by reversing the 6 million balance of commissions and fees which had been recorded during 2011 we have also reversed 2 million of salaries and benefits representing an overaccrual of production bonuses relating to the overstated revenue as a result of correcting these misstatements our financial statements for 2011 differ in certain immaterial respects including a net 001 reduction in adjusted earnings per diluted share from the unaudited financial statements included in our press release issued on february 14 2012 

 

the associates in question who have been placed on administrative leave pending completion of the investigation have not been members of willis executive management or played a significant role in internal control over financial reporting based on the results of our investigation to date we do not believe that any client or carrier funds were misappropriated or that any other business units were affected 

 

we have taken steps to enhance our internal controls in relation to the business unit in question including enhanced procedures over handling of cash receipts increased segregation of duties between the operating unit and the accounting and settlement function and additional central sign off on revenue recognition

cash retention awards 

 

we started making cash retention awards in 2005 to a small number of employees with the success of the program we expanded it over time to include more staff and we believe it is a contributing factor to the reduction in employee turnover we have seen in recent years 

 

salaries and benefits do not reflect the unamortized portion of annual cash retention awards made to employees employees must repay a proportionate amount of these cash retention awards if they voluntarily leave our employ other than in the event of retirement or permanent disability within a certain time period currently three years we make cash payments to our employees in the year we grant these retention awards and recognize these payments ratably over the period they are subject to repayment beginning in the quarter in which the award is made 

 

during 2011 we made 210 million of cash retention award payments compared with 196 million in 2010 and 148 million in 2009 salaries and benefits in 2011 include 185 million of amortization of cash retention award payments made on or before december 31 2011 compared with 119 million in 2010 and 88 million in 2009 as of december 31 2011 december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 we included 196 million 173 million and 98 million respectively within other current assets and other noncurrent assets on the balance sheet which represented the unamortized portion of cash retention award payments made on or before those dates 

 

pension expense 

 

we recorded a net pension charge on our uk and us defined benefit pension plans in 2011 of 6 million and nil respectively compared with 28 million and 1 million respectively in 2010 and 25 million and 7 million respectively in 2009 on our international defined benefit pension plans we recorded a net pension charge of 5 million in 2011 compared with 6 million in 2010 and 10 million in 2009 

 

the uk plan charge was 22 million lower compared to 2010 as the benefits of higher asset returns lower amortization of prior period losses and a lower service cost reflecting certain changes to plan benefits were partly offset by an increased interest cost the uk pension charge was 3 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009 as the benefit from higher asset returns was more than offset by a higher service cost higher amortization of prior period losses and higher interest cost 

 

the us pension charge was 1 million lower in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting an increased asset return from a higher asset base partly offset by a reduction in amortization of prior period losses the us pension charge was 6 million lower in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting an increased asset return a reduction in the amortization of prior period losses and the first full year’s benefit from closing the scheme to future accrual in may 2009 partly offset by the nonrecurrence of a 12 million curtailment gain in 2009 

 

see ‘contractual obligations’ below for further information on our obligations relating to our pension plans

during first quarter 2011 we acquired a 23 interest in a south african brokerage at a total cost of 2 million during third quarter 2011 we acquired a 100 interest in a polish brokerage brokerskie centrum ubezpieczeniowe at a total cost of 2 million in the fourth quarter 2011 we acquired 100 of broking italia a romebased employee benefits broker at a total cost of 12 million

consolidated results for 2011 compared to 2010 

 

revenues 

 

 

 

 

  

revenue increased by 115 million or 3 in 2011 compared to 2010 commissions and fees increased by 121 million or 4 including organic growth in commissions and fees of 2 which comprised 4 net new business growth driven by solid new business generation and higher retention of existing clients and a 2 negative impact from renewal fluctuations and other market factors 

 

there was a net 2 yearoveryear benefit to revenue growth from foreign currency translation driven by the weakening of the us dollar against a number of currencies in which we earn our revenues 

 

the 2 growth in organic commissions and fees comprised net growth in our operating segments 

 

  

investment income in 2011 at 31 million was 7 million lower than in 2010 as low interest rates across the globe in particular in the uk and us together with the rolloff of our interest rate hedge program continued to impact our investment income 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in ‘operating results — segment information’ below 

 

salaries and benefits 

 

salaries and benefits increased 219 million or 12 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily reflecting additional expense in 2011 of 135 million associated with our 2011 operational review a 66 million increase from the amortization of cash retention awards and the yearonyear net adverse impact from foreign currency translation driven primarily by the movement of the us dollar against the pound sterling in which our london market based operations incur the majority of their expenses furthermore we incurred an additional 10 million expense relating to the reinstatement of our 401k match plan for our north america employees from january 2011 and incremental expense following reinstatement of annual salary reviews for all employees from april 2011 these increases were partly offset by cost savings arising from implementation of the 2011 operational review reduced payments of nonretentive incentives and a 24 million decrease in pension expense driven by a higher return on assets and lower amortization of prior period gains and losses 

 

other expenses 

 

other operating expenses were 92 million or 16 higher in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily reflecting 40 million of additional expense associated with the 2011 operational review a 22 million writeoff of an uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods prior to january 1 2011 and discussed earlier in this section the 11 million second quarter uk fsa regulatory settlement and increased expense in support of revenue growth initiatives these were partly offset by cost savings arising from implementation of the 2011 operational review the yearoveryear favorable comparison due to the 12 million 2010 charge relating to the devaluation of the venezuelan currency the 8 million yearoveryear benefit from the release of funds and reserves related to potential legal liabilities and positive yearoveryear foreign currency translation driven primarily by gains in 2011 on our forward rate hedging program compared to losses in 2010 

 

depreciation expense was 74 million in 2011 compared with 63 million in 2010 the increase primarily reflects accelerated depreciation expense of 5 million in 2011 relating to systems rationalization in connection with the 2011 operational review and depreciation of newly capitalized systems project costs in 2011 

 

amortization of intangible assets was 68 million in 2011 a reduction of 14 million compared to 2010 the decrease primarily reflects the yearoveryear benefit of the 2010 amortization of the hrh noncompete agreement acquired in 2008 which was fully amortized in 2010 

 

makewhole on repurchase and redemption of senior notes and writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs 

 

as described above we issued 800 million of new debt in march 2011 and net proceeds of approximately 787 million were used to repurchase and redeem 500 million of 12875 senior notes due 2016 and make related makewhole payments totaling 158 million in addition to the makewhole payment we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of 13 million 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense was 156 million in 2011 a reduction of 10 million compared to 2010 the decrease in interest expense primarily reflects the lower coupon payable on our new debt issued in march 2011 the periodoverperiod decrease in the outstanding balance on our 5year term loan facility and net gains recognized on our forward rate hedging program these benefits were partially offset by the 10 million fourth quarter expense relating to the writeoff of debt issuance costs following the refinancing of our bank facility 

 

business discussion 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate on ordinary income for 2011 was 24 compared with 26 for 2010 with the reduction driven primarily by the benefit from the higher tax rates at which costs associated with the 2011 operational review are relieved and a different geographic mix of business the effective tax rate on ordinary income is calculated before the impact of certain discrete items the significant discrete items occurring in 2011 are 

 

  

including the impact of discrete items the effective tax rate was 13 in 2011 compared to 24 in 2010 

 

interest in earnings of associates net of tax 

 

we own an interest in a number of associates such as gras savoye where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we can achieve through full integration interest in earnings of associates net of tax was 12 million in 2011 compared with 23 million in 2010 the decline was mainly driven by a reduction in net income reported by our principal associate gras savoye following recent refinancing actions taken by the company ongoing restructuring activity and the negative impact on their results from adverse economic conditions in france and other parts of europe 

 

discontinued operations net of tax 

 

net income from discontinued operations in 2011 relates to our fourth quarter disposal of global special risks llc faber  dumas canada ltd and the trade and assets of maclean oddy  associates inc we recorded net income from discontinued operations of 1 million in 2011 comprising a net loss for the year of 1 million offset by the benefit of a 2 million net gain on disposal

consolidated results for 2010 compared to 2009 

 

revenues 

 

 

 

 

  

revenue increased 79 million or 2 in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting organic growth in commissions and fees of 4 offset by a 1 adverse impact from foreign currency translation and decreased investment and other income our global segment achieved 7 organic growth in commission and fees and the international segment achieved 5 growth north america organic commissions and fees growth was flat with the positive benefit from strong growth in our specialty businesses driven by good business growth together with a 7 million increase in commissions and fees from a change in accounting in an acquired specialty business to conform to current group accounting policy 3 growth in our employee benefits practice good net new business generation and improved client retention offset by the impact of the continued soft market and ongoing weakened economic conditions 

 

investment income was 12 million lower in 2010 compared to 2009 with the impact of lower interest rates across the globe particularly on our eurodenominated deposits partially mitigated by our forward hedging program 

 

organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in ‘operating results — segment information’ below 

 

salaries and benefits 

 

salaries and benefits increased by 46 million or 3 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a 60 million increase in incentive expenses comprising a 31 million increase in the amortization of cash retention awards and a 29 million increase in the accrual for nonretentive incentive compensation due to increased headcount and improved performance across many regions the increase in incentive expense was partially offset by reduced severance costs in 2010 and favorable foreign currency translation primarily the yearonyear strengthening of the us dollar against the pound sterling 

 

business discussion 

 

other expenses 

 

other operating expenses declined by 26 million in 2010 compared to 2009 as the benefit from 25 million of lower losses on our forward hedging program the release of a 7 million previously established legal reserve and continued disciplined management of discretionary expenses were partially offset by a 12 million first quarter 2010 charge relating to the devaluation of the venezuelan currency and expense increases in support of revenue growth initiatives 

 

amortization of intangible assets declined by 18 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the declining charge for the hrh customer relationship intangible and the yearonyear benefit from a 7 million accelerated amortization in 2009 relating to the hrh brand name 

 

net gain loss on disposal of operations declined by 15 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the recording in 2009 of a 10 million gain on sale following the partdisposal of the group’s holding in gras savoye 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense in 2010 was 8 million lower than in 2009 as interest expense savings arising from the reduction in average term loan and revolving credit facility balances was partly offset by the effect of the higher coupon payable on the 500 million 12875 senior unsecured notes issued in march 2009 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate was 24 for 2010 compared to 18 in 2009 as a 22 million benefit in 2010 from prior year tax adjustments was more than offset by the adverse impact from the 12 million charge relating to the devaluation of the venezuelan currency for which no tax credits are available and positive impacts on the 2009 effective tax rate from a 27 million release relating to a 2009 change in tax law and an 11 million release relating to uncertain tax positions due to the closure of the statute of limitations on assessments for previously unrecognized tax benefits excluding these items the effective tax rate of 26 on ordinary income for 2010 was broadly in line with 2009 

 

interest in earnings of associates net of tax 

 

interest in earnings of associates net of tax in 2010 of 23 million was 10 million lower than in 2009 primarily due to the reduction from 49 to 31 in our ownership interest in gras savoye as part of the reorganization of their capital structure in december 2009 interest receivable on the vendor financing we provided as part of the capital reorganization is recorded under this caption 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

debt

willis group holdings plc 

 

in march 2011 we issued 800 million of new debt comprised of 300 million 4125 senior notes due 2016 and 500 million 5750 senior notes due 2021 we received net proceeds after underwriting discounts and expenses of approximately 787 million which were used largely in part to repurchase and redeem 500 million 12875 senior notes due 2016 and make related makewhole payments totaling 158 million which represented a slight discount to the makewhole redemption amount provided in the indenture governing this debt in addition to the makewhole payments of 158 million we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of 13 million 

 

in december 2011 we refinanced our bank facility comprising a new 5year 300 million term loan and a new 5year 500 million revolving credit facility the 300 million term loan repaid the majority of the 328 million balance outstanding on our 700 million 5year term loan facility and the 500 million revolving credit facility replaces our existing 300 million and 200 million revolving credit facilities unamortized debt issuance costs of 10 million relating to these facilities were written off in december 2011 following completion of the refinancing in 2011 we made 83 million of mandatory repayments against the 5year term loan before repaying the 328 million balance in december 2011 

 

these refinancing actions have lengthened our debt maturity profile at december 31 2011 we have nil outstanding under both the 500 million and the existing 20 million facility compared with december 31 2010 when we had 90 million outstanding under our 300 million facility and nil outstanding under our 200 million and 20 million facilities at december 31 2011 the only scheduled debt repayments falling due over the next 12 months are scheduled repayments on our new 300 million 5year term loan totaling 11 million and repayment of the 4 million 6 loan notes due 2012 

 

liquidity 

 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations and 520 million available under our revolving credit facilities of which the 20 million uk facility is solely for use by our main regulated uk entity in certain exceptional circumstances at december 31 2011 we had 436 million of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 100 million is available for general corporate purposes 

 

as of december 31 2011 our shortterm liquidity requirements consisted of 125 million payment of interest on debt 11 million of mandatory repayments under our 5year term loan a 4 million mandatory repayment of our 6000 loan notes due 2012 1 million of revolving credit facility commitment fees capital expenditure and working capital requirements in addition our estimated pension contributions for 2012 are 142 million our longterm liquidity requirements consist of the principal amount of outstanding notes and borrowings under our 5year term loan facility 

 

based on current market conditions and information available to us at this time we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months 

 

pensions 

 

uk plan 

 

in early 2012 we provisionally agreed a revised funding strategy with the uk plan’s trustee whilst the proposed new funding strategy has not been definitively agreed at the date of this report we expect this to occur by the end of march 2012 and we expect the cash contributions to the scheme in 2012 to be approximately equal to those in 2011 of 92 million 

 

us plan 

 

we will make cash contributions of approximately 40 million to the us plan in 2012 compared to contributions of 30 million in 2011 we also intend to make lump sum payments to specific classes of us plan members in settlement of 

 

business discussion 

 

their pension obligations such payments will only be made in limited tranches whilst such payments will have a positive impact on the overall liabilities of the us plan they may require us to provide additional funding to the plan

operating activities 

 

total net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 439 million in 2011 compared with 489 million in 2010 the decrease of 50 million primarily reflects the 57 million yearonyear increase in accounts receivable reflecting increased revenue but also slower collections in the us due to current economic conditions cash outflows of approximately 120 million relating to the 2011 operational review and the 24 million yearonyear increase in payments for cash retention awards these were partly offset by realized cash savings resulting from the 2011 operational review and other working capital movements 

 

investing activities 

 

total net cash used in continuing investing activities was 101 million in 2011 compared to 94 million in 2010 the 101 million net outflow was mainly due to capital spend including fitout of our nashville office and it project investments

investing activities 

 

total net cash outflow from continuing investing activities was 94 million in 2010 compared with a net cash inflow of 102 million in 2009 the 2010 outflow was primarily due to capital spend and 21 million of payments for acquisitions of subsidiaries mainly in respect of prior year acquisitions in 2009 capital spend of 96 million was offset by net receipts of 113 million from changes in our ownership interest in gras savoye 42 million net proceeds from sale of discontinued operations mainly attributable to the second quarter 2009 disposal of bliss  glennon and 21 million proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used in continuing financing activities was 293 million in 2010 compared with 516 million in 2009 the net decrease in cash used in financing activities of 223 million was mainly attributable to a 90 million drawdown against the revolving credit facilities in 2010 and debt refinancing actions in 2009 that resulted in 102 million higher debt repayments net of debt issuance in that year

review of segmental results 

 

we organize our business into three segments global north america and international our global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for risks arising from specific industries and activities north america and international comprise our retail operations and provide services to small medium and major corporations 

 

the following table is a summary of our operating results by segment for the three years ended december 31 2011 in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

 

  

global 

 

our global operations comprise global specialties reinsurance willis faber  dumas formerly london market wholesale and as of 2010 willis capital markets  advisory wcma from january 1 2011 willis faber  dumas also includes our global markets international unit we have retrospectively adjusted our segmental information disclosures within this discussion to reflect this change to our reporting structure 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

the following table sets out revenues operating income organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended december 31 2011 in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

 

  

2011 compared to 2010 

 

revenues 

 

commissions and fees of 1073 million were 86 million or 9 higher in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting organic commissions and fees growth of 7 and a net benefit from foreign currency translation of 2 organic growth included the benefit of net new business generation despite the adverse impact of the continued difficult economic environment and soft market in many of the specialty classes 

 

organic growth included positive growth across reinsurance global specialties willis faber  dumas and wcma businesses together with a 6 million first quarter 2011 benefit from a change in accounting within a global specialty business to conform to current group accounting policy 

 

organic growth in reinsurance in 2011 was led by growth in north america and asiapacific and included the benefit of new business growth and a profitability initiative that may or may not recur overall reinsurance showed stable pricing with modest increases in some lines and geographies particularly those affected by catastrophe losses 

 

organic growth in global specialties was led by strong contributions from marine energy financial solutions and aerospace reflecting good new business high retention levels targeted hiring of producer talent and connectivity between the retail network and specialty businesses however the operating environment remains challenging across most global specialty businesses with depressed world trade and transit volumes industry consolidation and pressure on financing of construction projects still evident 

 

willis faber  dumas reported positive organic commissions and fees growth in 2011 and our wcma business was marginally positive compared to 2010 

 

the 2 net benefit to revenue growth from foreign currency translation in 2011 primarily reflected the periodoverperiod positive impact of the weakening of the us dollar against both the euro and pound sterling in which we earn a significant portion of global revenues 

 

productivity in global measured in terms of revenue per fte employee increased to 386000 for 2011 compared with 366000 for 2010 

 

client retention levels improved to 91 for 2011 compared with 90 for 2010 

 

business discussion 

 

operating margin 

 

operating margin was 33 in 2011 compared to 32 in 2010 as the benefit of 7 organic commissions and fees growth discussed above and an 18 million decrease in pension expense was offset by a net negative impact from foreign currency movements an 8 million increase in incentive expense including amortization of cash retention award payments and the impact of costs associated with continued support of current and future growth 

 

operating margin is impacted by foreign exchange movements as the london market operations earn revenues in us dollars pounds sterling and euros and primarily incur expenses in pounds sterling in addition they are exposed to exchange risk on certain pound sterlingdenominated balances 

 

the periodoverperiod net negative impact from foreign currency movements in 2011 primarily reflected the increased us dollar value of our pound sterling expense base as a result of the weakening of the us dollar versus the pound sterling and the net negative impact of translation of nonusd assets and liabilities into us dollar in our london market operations these factors were partially offset by the us dollar weakening against the pound sterling and the euro increasing the us dollar value of our pound and euro denominated revenues 

 

2010 compared to 2009 

 

revenues 

 

commissions and fees were 66 million or 7 higher in 2010 compared with 2009 which was driven by 7 organic commissions and fees growth 

 

our reinsurance and global specialties businesses reported midsingle digit organic growth in 2010 driven by net new business generation despite the adverse impact of the difficult rate environment and soft market in many of the specialty classes 

 

reinsurance reported strong new business growth in 2010 and client retention levels remained high organic growth in global specialties was led by strong contributions from financial and executive risks construction and energy reflecting strong new business improved retention targeted hiring of producer talent and improved cooperation across the retail and specialty businesses 

 

our wcma business contributed to organic growth in 2010 substantially due to a 9 million fee on a single capital markets transaction in the second quarter 

 

within willis faber  dumas revenues in faber  dumas were slightly lower than 2009 mainly reflecting the soft wholesale market together with continued pressure on the most economically sensitive lines such as bloodstock jewelry and fine arts 

 

productivity in global measured in terms of revenue per fte employee increased to 366000 for 2010 compared with 352000 for 2009 

 

client retention levels remained high at 90 for 2010 in line with 2009 

 

operating margin 

 

operating margin was 32 in 2010 compared with 33 in 2009 this decrease primarily reflected the adverse impact of foreign currency translation as the positive effect on our pound sterling expense base from the strengthening us dollar was more than offset by the adverse impact of foreign currency movements on sterlingdenominated balances 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

excluding the impact of this foreign currency translation global’s operating margin remained flat as the benefits of good organic commissions and fees growth and disciplined cost control were offset by the impact of costs associated with continued support of current and future growth 

 

north america 

 

our north america business provides risk management insurance brokerage related risk services and employee benefits brokerage and consulting to a wide array of industry and client segments in the united states canada and as of january 1 2011 mexico retail we have retrospectively adjusted our segmental information disclosures within this discussion to reflect the allocation of mexico retail operations to our north america segment 

 

the following table sets out revenues operating income organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended december 31 2011 in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

 

  

2011 compared to 2010 

 

revenues 

 

commissions and fees of 1314 million were 55 million or 4 lower in 2011 compared with 2010 of which 6 million was attributable to the decrease in legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the hrh acquisition from 11 million in 2010 to 5 million in 2011 

 

organic commissions and fees growth declined 4 in 2011 compared with 2010 as the benefits of new business generation and growth in some regions were more than offset by declining loan protector revenues and the impact of the soft market conditions and weakened economy across most sectors 

 

the decline in the financial performance of our loan protector business had a 2 negative impact on north america organic growth in commissions and fees and for the full year 2011 negatively impacted the segment’s revenue by 27 million the loan protector decline was driven by the loss of clients through attrition and ma activity industrywide commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures in the us in 2011 

 

following the introduction of health care reform legislation in 2010 some major health insurance carriers in north america began to change their compensation practices in particular lines of business in certain locations in response to market pressures those changes caused we announced in july 2011 that in order to remain competitive we would begin accepting standard compensation based on volume but would continue to resist traditional contingent commissions and bonus payments because while legal we believe these forms of compensation create conflicts with our clients after 

 

business discussion 

 

several months of review under changing market conditions we have concluded that we cannot be fully competitive on employee benefits business if we continue to refuse these legal forms of compensation consequently we will begin to accept all forms of compensation from employee benefits providers effective april 1 2012 in north america 

 

despite the decline in revenues productivity in north america measured in terms of revenue per fte employee increased to 235000 for 2011 compared with 234000 for 2010 

 

client retention levels were 91 in 2011 compared to 92 in 2010 

 

operating margin 

 

operating margin in north america was 20 in 2011 compared with 23 in 2010 reflecting the adverse impact from the 4 decline in organic commissions and fees growth discussed above a periodoverperiod increase in 401k match expense of 10 million following its reinstatement in january 2011 and a 7 million increase in incentive expense including amortization of cash retention award payments these were partly offset by a 5 million decrease in stockbased compensation expense and the benefit of cost reductions driven by the 2011 operational review and continued focus on expense management 

 

2010 compared to 2009 

 

revenues 

 

commissions and fees of 1369 million were 12 million or 1 lower for 2010 compared with 2009 excluding the 16 million decrease in legacy contingency commissions assumed as part of the hrh acquisition there was a modest increase in commissions and fees 

 

organic commissions and fees growth was flat for 2010 we experienced strong performance in our specialty businesses driven by good business growth together with a 7 million increase in commissions and fees from a change in accounting of an acquired specialty business in north america to conform to group accounting policy our employee benefits practice recorded 3 growth despite the soft labor market and we achieved good net new business generation with improved client retention this was offset by a negative 2 impact from rate declines and other market factors and a further decline in our construction business and smaller declines elsewhere reflecting continued soft market conditions and the weak us economy 

 

despite the small decline in revenues productivity in north america measured in terms of revenue per fte employee increased to 234000 for 2010 compared with 223000 for 2009 

 

client retention levels increased to 92 for 2010 compared with 91 for 2009 

 

operating margin 

 

operating margin in north america was 23 in both 2010 and 2009 as the benefits of continued disciplined cost control and underlying lower pension expense in 2010 were offset by a 16 million reduction in legacy hrh contingent commissions increased incentive expense including the impact of increased amortization of cash retention award payments and the nonrecurrence of a 9 million benefit in 2009 from the curtailment of the us pension plan relating to our north america retail employees 

 

international 

 

our international business comprises our retail operations in eastern and western europe the united kingdom and ireland asiapacific russia the middle east south africa and latin america the services provided are focused

2011 compared to 2010 

 

revenues 

 

commissions and fees of 1027 million were 90 million or 10 higher in 2011 compared with 2010 comprising 5 organic growth and a net 5 positive impact from foreign currency translation organic growth included net new business growth of 7 partly offset by the negative impact from rates and other market factors 

 

there were strong contributions to 2011 organic commissions and fees growth from most regions including doubledigit growth in our latin america and eastern europe regions together with singledigit growth in asia and western europe in particular there was strong growth in brazil chile argentina russia and china 

 

the singledigit organic commissions and fees growth in our large retail operation in continental europe was primarily driven by strong growth in italy spain and germany despite the ongoing challenging economic conditions in this region offset by lower commissions and fees in denmark and the netherlands 

 

organic commissions and fees growth in our uk and ireland retail operations declined 2 in 2011 compared with the same period 2010 driven by the economic pressures that continue to affect both the uk and ireland 

 

a significant part of international’s revenues are earned in currencies other than the us dollar most notably the euro pound sterling and australian dollar the net 5 benefit from foreign currency translation in 2011 primarily reflected the weakening of the us dollar against these and other currencies in which we earn international revenues 

 

productivity in our international business measured in terms of revenue per fte employee increased to 160000 for 2011 compared with 150000 for 2010 

 

client retention levels increased to 94 for 2011 compared with 93 for 2010 

 

operating margin 

 

operating margin in international was 21 in 2011 compared with 24 in 2010 with the decrease primarily reflecting a 17 million increase in incentive expenses including amortization of cash retention award payments the impact of the reinstated annual salary review for all employees from april 2011 and increased spending on initiatives to drive future growth including investment hires these increases were partly offset by the benefit from organic commissions and fees growth and favorable foreign currency movements as discussed above and reduced pension expense 

 

business discussion 

 

2010 compared to 2009 

 

revenues 

 

commissions and fees of 937 million were 39 million or 4 higher for 2010 compared with 2009 as the benefits of 5 organic commissions and fees growth and 1 from the net effect of acquisitions and disposals were partly offset by a 2 adverse impact from foreign currency translation organic growth included net new business growth of 8 and there was a negative 3 impact from rates and other market factors 

 

there were strong contributions to organic commissions and fees growth from most regions led by growth in latin america asiapacific and western europe there was further positive growth in our eastern europe operations driven by a strong contribution from russia organic commissions and fees growth was also positive in our uk and irish retail operations driven by new business growth in the uk our employee benefits practice which represents approximately 10 of international commissions and fees performed well in 2010 with growth in the mid single digits 

 

a significant part of international’s revenues are earned in currencies other than the us dollar the us dollar strengthened against a number of these currencies in 2010 compared with 2009 most notably the euro venezuelan bolivar fuerte danish kroner and pound sterling the adverse impact of this strengthening was partly offset by the weakening of the us dollar against the australian dollar the net impact of these movements was a 2 reduction in 2010 revenues compared to 2009 

 

productivity in our international business measured in terms of revenue per fte employee increased to 150000 for 2010 compared with 147000 for 2009 

 

client retention levels remained high at 93 for 2010 

 

operating margin 

 

operating margin in international was 24 in both 2010 and 2009 benefits from 5 organic commissions and fees growth and continued focus on disciplined expense management were offset by the adverse impact from foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and other currencies in which we earn a significant portion of our operating income increased incentive expenses including amortization of cash retention award payments a reduction in investment income driven by lower interest rates particularly in the eurozone and spending on initiatives to drive future growth 

 

corporate  other 

 

the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on organic commissions and fees growth and operating income for internal reporting and segmental reporting items for which segmental management are not held responsible for are held within ‘corporate  other’

critical accounting estimates 

 

our accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our audit committee 

 

pension expense 

 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the us and uk both these plans are now closed to new entrants and with effect from may 15 2009 we closed our us defined benefit plan to future accrual new entrants in the uk are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the united states are offered the opportunity to join a 401k plan we also have smaller defined benefit schemes in ireland germany norway and the netherlands these international schemes have combined total assets of 128 million and a combined net liability for pension benefits of 3 million as of december 31 2011 elsewhere pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans 

 

we recorded a net pension charge on our uk and us defined benefit pension plans in 2011 of 6 million and nil respectively compared with 28 million and 1 million respectively in 2010 on our international defined benefit pension plans we recorded a net pension charge of 5 million in 2011 compared with 6 million in 2010 

 

based on december 31 2011 assumptions we expect the net pension charge in 2012 to decrease by 11 million for the uk plan increase by 3 million for the us plan and increase a net 1 million for the international plans 

 

we make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate the discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination our approach to determining appropriate assumptions for our uk and us pension plans is set out below 

 

business discussion 

 

uk plan 

 

 

 

 

  

discount rate 

 

during 2011 we moved from an index based approach to determining the discount rate to a duration based approach which more closely matches the actual timings of expected cash flows to the applicable discount rate the selected rate used to discount uk plan liabilities was 480 compared with 545 at december 31 2010 with the decrease reflecting a reduction in uk longterm bond rates in 2011 under the old approach the discount rate at the end of 2011 would have been 465 we estimate the impact of this change was to 

 

  

the lower discount rate generated an actuarial loss of approximately 240 million at december 31 2011 

 

expected and actual asset returns 

 

expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net uk pension expense in 2011 was 750 2010 775 equivalent to an expected return in 2011 of 161 million 2010 141 million the decrease in the expected longterm rate of return followed a change in the underlying target asset mix 

 

the expected and actual returns on uk plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

 

 

mortality 

 

during 2011 we amended the mortality assumptions to more closely align them to those used in the most recent funding valuation the mortality assumption is now the 90  105 pna00 table for males  females 2010 100 pna00 table without an age adjustment 

 

this change gave rise to an approximate 85 million increase in the 2011 projected benefit obligation compared to using the 2010 mortality assumptions 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a uk male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2011 would have a life expectancy of 24 years 

 

us plan 

 

 

 

 

  

discount rate 

 

the rate used to discount us plan liabilities at december 31 2010 was 558 determined based on expected plan cash flows discounted using a corporate bond yield curve since the end of 2010 aa corporate bond spot yields have fallen and spreads of long term aa bonds over gilts have widened consequently the discount rate at december 31 2011 was 463 a reduction of 95 basis points from 2010 year end the impact of the lower discount rate in 2011 increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 100 million 

 

expected and actual asset returns 

 

the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net us pension scheme expense in 2011 was 750 a reduction of 025 from 2010 effective january 1 2012 the expected longterm rate of return was further decreased to 725 following a change in the underlying target asset mix 

 

the expected and actual returns on us plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

 

 

mortality 

 

the mortality assumption at december 31 2011 is the rp2000 mortality table blended for annuitants and nonannuitants projected by scale aa to 2019 for annuitants and 2027 for nonannuitants december 31 2010 projected to 2011 by scale aa this change more closely aligns assumptions made for accounting purposes to those for funding purposes the impact of the change in mortality assumptions increased the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2011 by approximately 27 million 

 

business discussion 

 

as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a us male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2011 would have a life expectancy of 19 years 

 

intangible assets 

 

intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of businesses acquired we classify our intangible assets into three categories 

 

  

client relationships acquired on the hrh acquisition are amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected to be consumed over 80 of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized after 10 years noncompete agreements acquired in connection with the hrh acquisition were amortized over two years on a straight line basis intangible assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis goodwill is not subject to amortization 

 

to determine the allocation of intangible assets between goodwill and other intangible assets and the estimated useful lives in respect of the hrh acquisition we considered a report produced by a qualified independent appraiser the calculation of the allocation is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions we base our allocation on assumptions we believe to be reasonable however changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

goodwill impairment review 

 

we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 

 

the goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis step one requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill is not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform step two step two requires the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to be compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit 

 

determination of reporting units 

 

we have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments north america international and global goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the reporting units 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

fair value of reporting units 

 

the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and in aggregate validated against our market capitalization 

 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include estimations of future cash flows which are dependent on internal forecasts longterm rate of growth for our business and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

 

we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain therefore changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and result in goodwill impairment 

 

in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

 

annual goodwill impairment analysis 

 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at october 1 at october 1 2011 our analysis showed the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value and therefore did not result in an impairment charge 2010 nil 2009 nil the fair values of the global and international reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values the fair value of the north american unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 our north america segment continued to be hampered by declining loan protector business results the effect of the soft economy in the us and declining retention rates primarily related to ma activity and lost legacy hrh business consequently the annual impairment test described above included additional sensitivity analysis over and above that we would usually perform in relation to our north america segment’s goodwill impairment review this additional analysis included reductions to assumed rates of revenue growth increases to assumed rates of expense growth and flexing the assumed weighted average cost of capital although our testing concluded there is no impairment the analysis indicated that in respect of the north america segment in the event of either a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of part of the reporting unit there could be an impairment to the carrying value in future periods 

 

income taxes 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards we estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies 

 

at december 31 2011 we had gross deferred tax assets of 432 million 2010 294 million against which a valuation allowance of 102 million 2010 87 million had been recognized to the extent that 

 

 56 

 

business discussion 

 

 

we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income 

 

positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities the benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts the company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions in 2011 there was a net increase in uncertain tax positions of 3 million compared to a net decrease of 4 million in 2010 the company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

 

we purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly over recent years we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice

pensions 

 

contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the contributions we expect to make over the next five years into our us uk and international plans these contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the plans 

 

uk plan 

 

we made total cash contributions to our uk defined benefit pension plan of 92 million in 2011 including amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice contribution compared with 88 million in 2010 and 49 million in 2009 

 

in the uk we are required to agree to a funding strategy for our uk defined benefit plan with the plan’s trustees in february 2009 we agreed to make full year contributions to the uk plan of approximately 39 million for 2009 through 2011 excluding amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme in addition if certain funding targets were not met at the beginning of any of those years a further contribution of approximately 39 million was required for that year the additional funding requirement was triggered in both 2010 and 2011 

 

the amounts included as contractual obligations in the table above reflect those payable under the current funding strategy which expires in march 2015 including amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice arrangements negotiations between the company and the plan trustees on a revised funding strategy are continuing as set out in the ‘liquidity and capital resources’ section 

 

us plan 

 

we made total cash contributions to our us defined benefit pension plan of 30 million in 2011 compared with 30 million in 2010 and 27 million in 2009 

 

we expect to make contributions of approximately 40 million in 2012 through 2016 under us pension legislation based on our december 31 2011 balance sheet position 

 

international plans 

 

we made total cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of 13 million in 2011 compared with 12 million in 2010 and 6 million in 2009 

 

in 2012 we expect to contribute approximately 12 million to our international plans 

 

based on the current uk funding strategy and as shown in the table above the total contracted contributions for all plans are currently estimated to be approximately 91 million in 2012 excluding amounts of approximately 12 million in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme however a revised uk funding strategy and hence 2012 contribution is expected 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

to be finalized shortly and the final 2012 contribution for all plans is expected to be approximately 142 million including salary sacrifice which compares to an equivalent 2011 total contribution of 135 million 

 

guarantees 

 

guarantees issued by certain of willis group holdings’ subsidiaries with respect to the senior notes and revolving credit facilities are discussed in note 21 — commitments and contingencies — in these consolidated financial statements 

 

certain of willis group holdings’ subsidiaries have given the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the company in the uk and the us guarantees in respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding the lease the operating lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to 828 million and 855 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

 

in addition the company has given guarantees to bankers and other third parties relating principally to letters of credit amounting to 3 million and 11 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively willis group holdings also guarantees certain of its uk and irish subsidiaries’ obligations to fund the uk and irish defined benefit plans 

 

other contractual obligations 

 

for certain subsidiaries and associates the company has the right to purchase shares a call option from coshareholders at various dates in the future in addition the coshareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell a put option their shares to the company at various dates in the future generally the exercise price of such put options and call options is formulabased using revenues and earnings and is designed to reflect fair value 

 

at december 31 2011 the company owned 501 of gras savoye re a company we consolidate in our financial statements in january 2012 the coshareholders of gras savoye exercised a put option for the company to acquire the remaining 499 of gras savoye re for approximately 30 million and we anticipate concluding this transaction in march 2012 

 

based on current projections of profitability and exchange rates and assuming the put options are exercised the potential amount payable from these options including gras savoye re is not expected to exceed 72 million 2010 40 million 

 

in july 2010 the company made a capital commitment of 25 million to trident v parallel fund lp an investment fund managed by stone point capital this replaced a capital commitment of 25 million that had been made to trident v lp in december 2009 as at december 31 2011 there have been approximately 6 million of capital contributions 

 

in may 2011 the company made a capital commitment of 10 million to dowling capital partners i lp as at december 31 2011 there had been no capital contributions 

 

other contractual obligations at december 31 2011 also include the capital lease on the company’s nashville property of 63 million payable from 2012 onwards 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board ‘fasb’ issued new guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that fair value measurements and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ‘ifrs’ the guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 

 

in june 2011 the fasb issued new guidance to revise the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements requiring that the components of comprehensive income be presented in either a single 

 

business discussion 

 

continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income oci or when an item of oci must be reclassified to net income 

 

in september 2011 the fasb also issued guidance to allow an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit all of the above accounting changes become effective for the company from first quarter 2012 

 

further details of the changes are described in note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements 

 

other than the changes described above there were no new accounting standards issued during 2011 that would impact on the company’s reporting 

 

off balance sheet transactions 

 

apart from commitments guarantees and contingencies as disclosed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements the company has no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity

financial risk management 

 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes 

 

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 — basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements and further disclosure is provided in note 25 — derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results 

 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the united states we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling

in our london market operations we earn revenue in a number of different currencies principally us dollars pounds sterling euros and japanese yen but incur expenses almost entirely in pounds sterling 

 

we hedge this risk as follows

market risk 

 

in addition we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any net sterling asset or liability position in our london market operations 

 

however where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit we do not hedge the risk consequently if our london market operations have a significant pension asset or liability we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the us dollar and pounds sterling exchange rate changes we do however hedge the pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan 

 

translation risk 

 

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower 

 

we do not hedge translation risk 

 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within three years

willis group holdings plc 

 

 

income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the uk is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities the company does not hedge net income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the uk 

 

interest rate risk management 

 

our operations are financed principally by 2050 million fixed rate senior notes issued by the group and 300 million under a new 5year term loan facility of the fixed rate senior notes 350 million are due 2015 300 million are due 2016 600 million are due 2017 300 million are due 2019 and 500 million are due 2021 the 5year term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments and a final repayment of 225 million is due in the forth quarter of 2016 as of december 31 2011 we had access to 520 million under revolving credit facilities and no drawings had been made under those facilities the interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown 

 

we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in both us dollars and pounds sterling 

 

as a result of our operating activities we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies we earn interest on these funds which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which it may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity in order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets we enter into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest in the various currencies related to the shortterm investments the use of interest rate contracts essentially converts groups of shortterm variable rate investments to fixed rates however in the fourth quarter of 2011 we stopped renewing hedged positions on their maturity given the current flat yield curve environment 

 

during the year ended december 31 2010 the company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of 350 million to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semiannual basis with a maturity date of july 15 2015 the company has designated and accounts for these instruments as fair value hedges against its 350 million 5625 senior notes due 2015 the fair values of the interest rate swaps are included within other assets or other liabilities and the fair value of the hedged element of the senior notes is included within the principal amount of the debt 

 

the table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for interest rate swaps the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts the duration of interest rate swaps varies between one and five years with refixing periods of three to six months average fixed and variable rates are respectively the weightedaverage actual and market rates for the interest hedges in place market rates are the rates prevailing at december 31 2011 or 2010 as appropriate

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

to the board of directors and stockholders of willis group holdings public limited company dublin ireland 

 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of willis group holdings public limited company and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2011 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2011 of the company and our report dated february 29 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

skills industry knowledge and expertise available elsewhere in the group 

 

the services provided are focused according to the characteristics of each market and vary across offices but generally include direct risk management and insurance brokerage specialist and reinsurance brokerage and employee benefits consulting 

 

we believe the combined total revenues of our international subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread and capability of our international network the team generated over 30 percent of the group’s total consolidated commissions and fees in 2010

customers 

 

 

our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational corporations to middlemarket companies further many of our client relationships span decades for instance our relationship with the tokio marine and fire insurance company limited 

dates back over 100 years no one client accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues for fiscal year 2010 additionally we place insurance with over 5000 insurance carriers none of which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2010 

 

 

competition 

 

 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price according to the directory of agents and brokers published by business insurance in july 2010 the 136 largest commercial insurance brokers globally reported brokerage revenues totaling 38 billion in 2009 of which marsh  mclennan companies inc had approximately 28 percent aon corporation had approximately 20 percent and willis had approximately 9 percent 

 

we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms 

insurance companies also compete with brokers by directly soliciting insureds without the assistance of an independent broker or agent 

 

competition for business is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers many insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies are increasingly relying upon captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buying insurance 

 

additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

 

in 2005 we along with marsh  mclennan and aon agreed to implement certain business reforms which included codification of our voluntary termination of contingent commission arrangements with insurers however most other special regional and local insurance brokers continued to accept contingent compensation and did not disclose the compensation received in connection with providing policy placement services to its customers in february 2010 we entered into the amended and restated assurance of discontinuance with the attorney general of the state of new york and the amended and restated stipulation with the 

superintendent of insurance of the state of new york which ended many of the requirements previously imposed upon us the new agreement no longer limits the type of compensation we can receive and lowers the compensation disclosure requirements we must make to our clients 

 

we continue to refuse to accept contingent commissions from carriers in our retail brokerage business to our knowledge we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance we seek to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to our clients and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of valueadded risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities although we continue to believe in the success of our strategy we cannot be certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable organic revenue growth 

 

regulation 

 

 

our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasigovernmental regulatory supervision in virtually all countries in which we operate also such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities while these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria 

 

united states 

 

our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the united states are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction insurance laws in the united states are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in 

a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions 

 

european union 

 

the european union insurance mediation directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the eu on a basis consistent with the eu single market and customer protection aims each eu member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence good repute professional indemnity cover and financial capacity 

 

about willis 

 

united kingdom 

 

in the united kingdom the statutory body is the financial services authority ‘fsa’ the fsa has prescribed the methods by which our insurance and reinsurance operations are to conduct business and has a wide range of rulemaking investigatory and enforcement powers aimed at meeting its overall aim of promoting efficient orderly and fair markets and helping retail consumers achieve a fair deal the fsa conducts monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements 

 

certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment and securities licensing authorities in the united states willis capital markets  advisory operates through our whollyowned subsidiary willis securities inc a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member finrasipc primarily in connection with investment bankingrelated services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions willis capital markets provides advice on securities or investments 

in the eu through our whollyowned subsidiary willis structured financial solutions limited which is authorized and regulated by the fsa 

 

our failure or that of our employees to satisfy the regulators that we are in compliance with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities can result in disciplinary action fines reputational damage and financial harm 

 

all companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the united states and united kingdom we do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position 

 

see part i item 1arisk factors ‘legal and regulatory risks’ for discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

employees 

 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 17000 employees worldwide of whom approximately 3400 were employed in the united kingdom and 6500 in the united states with the balance being 

employed across the rest of the world in addition our associates had approximately 3000 employees all of whom were located outside the united kingdom and the united states

 item 1a — risk factors 

 

risks relating to our business and the insurance industry 

 

 

 

this section describes material risks affecting the group’s business these risks could materially affect the group’s business its revenues operating income net income net assets liquidity and capital 

resources and ability to achieve its financial targets and accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k 

 

 

 

competitive risks 

 

worldwide economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

 

 

our business and operating results are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions current global economic conditions coupled with declining customer and business confidence increasing energy prices and other challenges may have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from these conditions in particular financial institutions construction aviation and logistics businesses such as marine cargo are most likely to be affected further the global economic downturn is also negatively affecting some of the international economies that have supported the strong growth in our international operations our employee benefits practice may also be adversely affected as businesses continue to downsize during this period of economic turmoil in addition a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business while it is difficult to predict consequences of any further deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability the potential for an insurer to fail could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients 

 

since 2008 we have launched certain initiatives such as the company’s recently announced 2011 review of operations the willis cause right sizing willis funding for growth and shaping our future to achieve costsavings or fund our future growth plans in light of the global economic uncertainty we continue to vigorously manage our cost base in order to fund further growth initiatives but we cannot be certain whether we will be able to realize any further benefits from these initiatives or any new initiatives that we may implement 

 

while we focus on our core retail and specialist broking operations we do have certain other businesses that are not material to the group as a whole but which in any period could have a material affect on our results of operations 

 

 

 

we do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability 

 

 

 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services we 

do not determine insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based premiums are 

 

risk factors 

 

cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions from the late 1980s through late 2000 insurance premium rates generally declined as a result of a number of factors including the expanded underwriting capacity of insurance carriers consolidation of both insurance intermediaries and insurance carriers and increased competition among insurance carriers from 2000 to 2003 we benefitted from a ‘hard’ market with premium rates stable or increasing during 2004 we saw a rapid transition from a hard market with premium rates stable or increasing to a ‘soft’ market with premium rates falling in most markets the soft market continued to have an adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin from 2005 through 2008 rates continued to decline in most sectors through 2005 and 2006 with the exception of catastropheexposed markets in 2007 the market softened further with decreases in many of the market sectors in which we operated and this continued into 2008 with further premium rate declines across our market sectors in 2009 the stabilization of rates in the reinsurance market and some specialty markets was offset by the continuing 

soft market in other sectors and the adverse impact of the weakened economic environment across the globe our north america and uk and irish retail operations have been particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market throughout both 2009 and 2010 with no material improvement in rates across most sectors this resulted in declines in 2009 revenues in these operations with only modest improvement in 2010 particularly amongst our smaller clients who have been especially vulnerable to the economic downturn 

 

in addition as traditional riskbearing insurance carriers continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated agents or brokers such as ourselves those insurance carriers may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

 

 

competition in our industry is intense and if we are unable to compete effectively we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

 

 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two other providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms competition for business is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market and the other two providers of global risk management services have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers many insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies have been increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies 

selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buying insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

 

in 2005 we along with marsh  mclennan and aon agreed to implement certain business reforms which included codification of our voluntary termination of contingent commission arrangements with insurers however most other special regional and local insurance brokers continued to accept contingent compensation and did not disclose the compensation received in connection with providing policy placement services to its customers in february 2010 we entered into the amended and restated assurance of discontinuance with the attorney general of the state of new york and the 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

amended and restated stipulation with the superintendent of insurance of the state of new york which ended many of the requirements previously imposed upon us the new agreement no longer limits the type of compensation we will receive and lowers the compensation disclosure requirements we must make to our clients 

 

we continue to refuse to accept contingent commissions from carriers in our retail brokerage business to our knowledge we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance we seek to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to our clients and to generate 

profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of valueadded risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities although we continue to believe in the success of our strategy we cannot be certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable organic revenue growth if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors who are accepting or may accept contingent commissions we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

 

dependence on key personnel — the loss of our chairman and chief executive officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives 

 

 

 

the loss of our chairman and chief executive officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our chairman and chief executive officer joseph j plumeri and other members of our senior management but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships the insurance and 

reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand train and manage our employee base we may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense 

 

 

 

legal and regulatory risks 

 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

 

 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states the united kingdom and the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate indeed over the last few years there has been a general increase in focus and developments in these laws and regulations compliance with laws 

and regulations that are applicable to our operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include insurance industry regulations economic and trade sanctions and laws against financial crimes such as money laundering bribery or other corruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act in most 

 

risk factors 

 

jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions civil remedies fines injunctions revocation of licenses or approvals suspension of individuals limitations on business activities or redress to clients 

 

given the increased interest expressed by uk and us regulators in the effectiveness of compliance controls relating to financial crime in our market sector in particular we began a voluntary internal review of our policies and controls four years ago this review includes analysis and advice from external experts on best practices review of public regulatory decisions and discussions with government regulators in the uk and us in 

addition the uk financial services authority is conducting an investigation of some of our compliance systems and controls between 2005 and 2009 while we are fully cooperating with our regulators we are unable to predict at this time when these matters will be concluded we do not believe that such matters will result in any material fines or sanctions from uk or us regulators but there can be no assurance that any resolution will not have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business in certain jurisdictions while we believe that our current systems and controls are adequate and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of applicable laws and regulations 

 

 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings 

 

 

 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist our clients with matters including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims involving substantial amounts of money errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question 

 

claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include allegations of damages for our employees or subagents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis errors and omissions claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly in recent years in respect of 

selfinsured risks we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience 

 

we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims the material actual or potential claims lawsuits and proceedings to which we are currently subject including but not limited to errors and omissions claims are 1 potential claims arising out of various legal proceedings between reinsurers reinsureds and their reinsurance brokers relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance placements for the years 1993 to 1998 and 2 claims relating to the collapse of the stanford financial group for which we acted as brokers of record on certain lines of insurance 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from 

operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may also be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships 

 

 

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing systems could cause material financial loss loss of human resources regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

 

 

 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and to develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards the acquisition of hrh and additional information systems has added 

to this exposure if the information we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems including through a telecommunications failure failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer applications or software systems or if we experience other disruptions this could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability 

 

 

 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

 

 

 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located this may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against 

such contingencies such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

 

 

 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

 

 

 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential 

and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we maintain policies procedures 

 

risk factors 

 

and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information in our database however we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we maintain in our databases and protect it from theft or inadvertent loss in such circumstances we may be held liable to our clients which could result in legal liability or impairment to 

our reputation resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue further database privacy identity theft and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace 

 

 

financial risks 

 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 23 billion and interest expense was 166 million although management believes that our cash flows will be more than adequate to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may 

 

 

  

the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated adjusted ebitda to consolidated fixed charges and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments 

 

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

 

 

our pension liabilities may increase which could require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans 

 

 

 

we have two principal defined benefit plans one in the united kingdom and the other in the united states cash contributions of approximately 119 million will be required in 2011 for these pension plans although we may elect to contribute more total cash contributions to these defined benefit 

pension plans in 2010 were 118 million future estimates are based on certain assumptions including discount rates interest rates fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets in the uk we are required to agree a funding strategy for our uk defined benefit plan with the plan’s trustees 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

in february 2009 we agreed to make full year contributions to the uk plan of 39 million for 2009 through 2012 excluding amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme in addition if certain funding targets were not met at the beginning of any of the following years 2010 through 2012 a further contribution of 39 million would be required for that year in 2010 the additional funding requirement was triggered and we expect to make a similar additional contribution in 2011 a similar additional contribution may also be required for 2012 depending on actual performance against funding targets at the beginning of 2012 we have taken actions to manage our pension liabilities including closing our uk and us plans to new participants and restricting final pensionable salaries future benefit accruals in the us pension plan were also stopped or frozen on may 15 2009 

 

the determinations of pension expense and pension funding are based on a variety of rules and regulations changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets they may also result in higher pension costs additional financial statement disclosure and accelerate and increase the need to fully fund our pension plans our future required cash contributions to our us and uk defined benefit pension plans may increase based on the funding reform provisions that were enacted into law further a significant decline in the value of investments that fund our pension plan if not offset 

or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities may significantly differ from or alter the values and actuarial assumptions used to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required to fund our plan with significant amounts of cash in addition if the us pension benefit guaranty corporation requires additional contributions to such plans or if other actuarial assumptions are modified our future required cash contributions could increase the need to make these cash contributions may reduce the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or to meet the needs of our business 

 

in addition to the critical assumptions described above our plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan participants and surviving spouses periodic revision of those assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pension expense changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees as a result there can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those which have been estimated 

 

 

we could incur substantial losses if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations failed 

 

 

 

the deterioration of the global credit and financial markets has created challenging conditions for financial institutions including depositories as the fallout from the credit crisis persists the financial strength of these institutions may continue to decline we maintain cash balances at various us depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the us federal deposit insurance corporation insurance 

limits we also maintain cash balances in foreign financial institutions if one or more of the institutions in which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses 

 

 

risk factors 

 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility 

 

 

 

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities and reduce our financial flexibility in addition certain downgrades would trigger a stepup in interest rates under the indentures for our 

62 senior notes due 2017 and our 70 senior notes due 2019  which would increase our interest expense if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources 

 

 

 

we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of business or reorganization of existing investments 

 

 

 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we may acquire or dispose of or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate opportunities negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions once we complete acquisitions or reorganizations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction including revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies for example if we fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies 

expected from a transaction goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired in future periods in addition we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies which may impact our results of operations if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce overheads related to the divested assets 

 

 

 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

 

 

 

willis group holdings is organized as a holding company that conducts no business of its own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to shareholders and for corporate expenses legal and regulatory restrictions foreign exchange controls as 

well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and make other payments to willis group holdings we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on ordinary shares 

 

 

 

international risks 

 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

 

 

 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the united states accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks 

associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside the united states and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency the table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2010 

 

 

 

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the 

profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses together with any net sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollar denominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure 

 

for example as the pound sterling strengthens the us dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase which then causes our results to be negatively impacted our results may also be adversely impacted if we are holding a net sterling position in our us dollar denominated london market operations if the pound sterling weakens any net sterling asset we are holding will be less valuable when translated into us dollars given these facts the strength of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results this risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations in the future 

 

where possible we hedge part of our operating exposure to exchange rate movements but such mitigating attempts may not be successful 

 

 

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries 

 

 

 

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks our businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets and we expect this trend to continue the possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses these risks include 

 

 

 

 

risk factors 

 

 

  

 

legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us and our effective tax rate may increase 

 

 

 

there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate which include the potential legislative actions described below and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate for example legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which we rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered 

a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions including the us we could be subjected to increased taxation in addition any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased taxation 

 

 

 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

 

 

 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not be directly enforceable in ireland while not directly enforceable it is possible for a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability to be enforced in ireland through common law rules however this 

process is subject to numerous established principles and would involve the commencement of a new set of proceedings in ireland to enforce the judgment 

 

as an irish company willis group holdings is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of willis group holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

 

 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

our noncore operations pose certain underwriting advisory or reputational risks 

 

 

 

we provide a broad range of brokerage reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide we also engage in certain noncore operations for example our willis capital markets  advisory business provides advice to insurance and reinsurance companies on a broad array of mergers and acquisition transactions as well 

as capital markets products including acting as underwriter or agent for primary issuances operating a secondary insurancelinked securities trading desk and engaging in general capital markets and strategic advisory work these operations may pose certain underwriting advisory or reputational risks to our core business

on february 18 2011 the last reported sale price of our shares as reported by the nyse was 3968 per share as of february 18 2011 there were approximately 1846 shareholders of record of our shares 

 

 

dividends 

 

 

we normally pay dividends on a quarterly basis to shareholders of record on march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 the dividend payment dates and amounts are as follows 

 

 

 

there are no governmental laws decrees or regulations in ireland which will restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to nonresident holders of the company’s shares 

 

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 percent residents of the us should be exempted from irish 

dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends an exception to this position applies where a shareholder holds shares in the company through a branch or agency in ireland through which a trade is carried on 

 

with respect to noncorporate us shareholders certain dividends received before january 1 2011 from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states such as our shares noncorporate us shareholders that do not

recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances

business overview and market outlook 

 

 

we provide a broad range of insurance broking risk management and consulting services to our clients worldwide our core specialty businesses include aerospace energy marine construction financial and executive risks fine art jewelry and specie special contingency risks and reinsurance our retail operations provide services to small medium and major corporations and the employee benefits practice our largest productbased practice group provides health welfare and human resources consulting and brokerage services 

 

in our capacity as advisor and insurance broker we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements helping clients determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network 

 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers 

have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums they may vary widely between accounting periods reductions in premium rates leading to downward pressure on commission revenues a ‘soft’ market can have a potentially material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin 

 

a ‘hard’ market occurs when premium uplifting factors including a greater than anticipated loss experience or capital shortages more than offset any downward pressures on premiums this usually has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin 

 

from 2000 through 2003 we benefited from a hard market with premium rates stable or increasing during 2004 we saw a rapid transition from a hard market to a soft market with premium rates falling in most markets rates continued to decline in most sectors through 2005 and 2006 with the exception 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

of catastropheexposed markets in 2007 the market softened further with decreases in many of the market sectors in which we operated and this continued into 2008 with further premium rate declines across our markets the soft market had an adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin from 2005 through 2008 

 

in 2009 modest stabilization of rates in the reinsurance market and some specialty markets was offset by the continuing soft market in other sectors and the adverse impact of the weakened economic environment across the globe 

 

in 2010 the soft market continued across many sectors including the reinsurance market 

 

our north america and uk and irish retail operations have been particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market throughout both 2009 and 2010 with no material improvement in rates across most sectors 

this resulted in declines in 2009 revenues in these operations with only modest improvement in 2010 particularly amongst our smaller clients who have been especially vulnerable to the economic downturn 

 

in 2011 our main priorities will include 

 

  

executive summary 

 

overview 

 

 

despite the difficult market conditions during the year we reported total revenue growth of 2 percent in 2010 mainly reflecting 4 percent organic growth in commissions and fees partly offset by a negative 1 percent impact from foreign currency translation 

 

organic revenue growth was driven by our global and international operations which both reported 6 percent organic growth whilst revenues in our north america operations were broadly in line with 2009 as this segment continued to be adversely 

impacted by the soft market and difficult economic conditions 

 

operating margin was 23 percent in 2010 compared with 21 percent in 2009 the year on year improvement mainly reflected the benefit of organic growth in commissions and fees continuing disciplined management of costs and a small favorable effect from foreign currency movements partly offset by increased incentive costs 

 

 

 

results from continuing operations 2010 compared with 2009 

 

 

 

net income from continuing operations in 2010 was 455 million or 266 per diluted share compared with 436 million or 258 per diluted share in 2009 

 

total revenues from continuing operations at 3339 million for 2010 were 76 million or 2 percent higher than in 2009 reflecting organic commissions and fees growth of 4 percent partly offset by an adverse impact from foreign currency translation a 16 million decrease attributable to the year over year reduction in contingent 

commissions assumed as part of the hrh acquisition and a 14 million decrease in investment and other income 

 

organic commissions and fees growth of 4 percent comprised 6 percent net new business growth which constitutes the revenue growth from business won over the course of the year net of the revenue from existing business lost and a 2 percent negative impact from declining premium rates and other market factors 

 

business discussion 

 

operating margin at 23 percent was 2 percentage points higher than in 2009 with the increase mainly reflecting 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

 

  

interest expense in 2010 was 166 million 8 million lower than in 2009 as the benefit of the interest expense savings arising from the year over year reduction in average term loan and revolving credit facility balances was partly offset by the effect of the higher coupon payable on the 500 million of 12875 senior unsecured notes issued in march 2009 

 

income tax expense for 2010 was 140 million compared with 96 million in 2009 both years benefited from a release of provisions for uncertain tax positions and 2009 additionally benefited from a 27 million tax credit following a change to uk tax law 

 

earnings from associates were 23 million in 2010 compared with 33 million in 2009 with the decrease primarily reflecting our reduced ownership of gras savoye 

 

 

results from continuing operations 2009 compared with 2008 

 

 

 

net income from continuing operations in 2009 was 436 million or 258 per diluted share compared with 302 million or 204 per diluted share in 2008 this increase included organic growth in commissions and fees a reduction in costs associated with our 2008 expense review from 045 per diluted share in 2008 to 011 per diluted share for severance costs in 2009 and a onetime tax release in 2009 relating to a change in uk tax law in 2009 equivalent to 016 per diluted share 

total revenues from continuing operations at 3263 million for 2009 were 436 million or 15 percent higher than in 2008 organic revenue growth of 2 percent and a 19 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals in 2009 driven by the fourth quarter 2008 acquisition of hrh were partly offset by a negative 4 percent impact from foreign currency translation and a 31 million decrease in investment income compared to 2008 

 

organic revenue growth of 2 percent comprised 5 percent net new business growth which 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

constitutes the revenue growth from business won over the course of the year net of the revenue from existing business lost and a 3 percent negative impact from declining premium rates and other market factors 

 

operating margin at 21 percent was 3 percentage points higher than in 2008 with the increase mainly reflecting

2011 operational review 

 

 

 

willis aims to be the broker and risk adviser of choice globally by aligning our business model to the needs of each client segment and maintaining a focus on growth this is our value proposition which we call the ‘willis cause’ 

 

we expect 2011 salaries and benefits expense to include an increase of approximately 100 million compared with 2010 as a result of the following 

 

  

we estimate that of those items noted above approximately 20 million to 25 million will continue through to 2012 as incremental expense reflecting a further but significantly lower increase in the amortization of cash retention awards in 2012 

compared with 2011 and the full year impact of the 2011 annual salary review 

 

in addition to these costs we will continue to invest in technology advanced analytics product innovation and industry talent and expertise to support the growth strategy and continued execution of the willis cause through 2011 and beyond 

 

in order to fund the higher anticipated salaries and benefits expense and these investments we are undertaking a review of all our businesses to better align our resources with our growth strategies we expect to complete this review in the first quarter of 2011 

 

in connection with this review we anticipate that we will incur pretax charges of approximately 110 million to 130 million primarily recorded in the first quarter of 2011 we also anticipate that the operational review will result in cost savings of approximately 65 million to 80 million in 2011 reaching annualized savings of approximately 90 million to 100 million in 2012 

 

 

outlook 

 

 

as a result of the 2011 operational review and the continued investment in our business model we expect to deliver

the statements under ‘2011 operational review’ and ‘outlook’ constitute forwardlooking statements 

please see ‘forwardlooking statements’ for certain cautionary information regarding forwardlooking statements and a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forwardlooking statements 

 

venezuela currency devaluation 

 

 

 

with effect from january 1 2010 the venezuelan economy was designated as hyperinflationary the venezuelan government also devalued the bolivar fuerte in january 2010 as a result of these actions 

we recorded a 12 million charge in other expenses in 2010 to reflect the remeasurement of our net assets denominated in venezuelan bolivar fuerte at january 1 2010 

 

 

 

acquisitions 

 

 

 

during 2010 we acquired 

 

 

  

 

 

cash and financing 

 

 

 

cash at december 31 2010 was 316 million 95 million higher than at december 31 2009 this increase in cash was partly attributable to additional cash balances being held in our main uk regulated company 

 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2010 was 489 million compared with 419 million in 2009 

 

net cash generated from operating activities in 2010 of 489 million was used to fund debt repayments of 209 million dividends to stockholders of 176 million and fixed asset additions of 83 million 

 

in august 2010 we entered into a new revolving credit facility agreement under which a further 200 million is available this facility is in addition to the remaining availability under our previously existing 300 million revolving credit facility 

 

in addition in june 2010 we entered into an additional facility solely for the use of our main uk 

regulated entity under which a further 20 million would be available in certain exceptional circumstances this facility is secured against the freehold of the uk regulated entity’s freehold property in ipswich 

 

at december 31 2010 we have nil outstanding under both the 200 million and the 20 million facilities and 90 million outstanding under our preexisting 300 million facility 

 

total debt total equity and the capitalization ratio at december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 

 

liquidity 

 

 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations cash and cash equivalents of 316 million at december 31 2010 and 

430 million remaining availability under our revolving credit facilities 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

we remain committed to our previously stated goals of ongoing debt repayment and returning capital to shareholders 

 

consistent with this strategy we are currently reviewing our debt profile and subject to prevailing market conditions may seek to take advantage of attractive financing rates to reduce the cost and extend the maturity profile of our existing debt 

 

such actions may include redemption of the entire 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 

12875 senior notes due 2016 if the 2016 senior notes are redeemed we anticipate that we would incur a onetime pretax charge of approximately 180 million relating to the makewhole premium provided under the terms of the indenture governing the notes as calculated at december 31 2010 

 

based on current market conditions and information available to us at this time we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months 

 

management structure 

 

 

effective january 1 2011 we have changed our internal reporting structure global markets international previously reported within our international segment is now reported in our global 

division in addition mexico which was previously reported within our international segment is now reported in our north america segment

total revenues for the group and by operating segment for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 are shown below 

 

 

business discussion 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited 

 

revenues for 2010 at 3339 million were 76 million or 2 percent higher than in 2009 reflecting organic growth in commissions and fees of 4 percent offset by a 1 percent adverse year over year impact from foreign currency translation and decreased investment and other income 

 

investment income was 38 million for 2010 12 million lower than 2009 with the impact on investment income of lower interest rates across the globe particularly on our eurodenominated deposits only partially mitigated by our forward hedging program while we expect this forward hedging program to generate additional income in 2011 compared to current libor based rates there will be a lower benefit than in 2010 as older more beneficial hedges continue to expire consequently we expect investment income to be closer to 30 million in 2011 

 

our international and global operations earn a significant portion of their revenues in currencies other than the us dollar including the euro and pound sterling for the year ended december 31 

2010 reported revenues were adversely impacted by the year over year effect of foreign currency translation in particular due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro venezuelan bolivar fuerte and pound sterling partly offset by its weakening against the australian dollar 

 

organic growth in commissions and fees was 4 percent for 2010 global achieved 6 percent growth driven by good growth in our reinsurance willis capital markets  advisory wcma and global specialties businesses international also achieved 6 percent growth driven by double digit organic growth in latin america and asia together with solid growth in europe north america organic revenue growth was flat as the benefits of double digit new business growth and a change in accounting policy in an acquired specialty business were offset by the impact of the continued soft market and ongoing weakened economic conditions 

 

organic revenue growth by segment is discussed further in ‘operating results — segment information’ below

2009 compared with 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited 

 

revenues for 2009 at 3263 million were 436 million or 15 percent higher than in 2008 reflecting a 20 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals principally attributable to hrh and organic growth in commissions and fees of 2 percent offset by a 4 percent adverse year over year impact from foreign currency translation a reduction in legacy hrh contingent commissions and lower investment income 

 

investment income was 50 million for 2009 31 million lower than 2008 with the decrease reflecting significantly lower average interest rates in 2009 the impact of rate decreases on our investment income was partially mitigated by our forward hedging program 

 

our international and global operations earn a significant portion of their revenues in currencies 

other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2009 reported revenues were adversely impacted by the year over year effect of foreign currency translation in particular due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the pound sterling and against the euro compared with 2008 

 

organic growth in commissions and fees was 2 percent for 2009 despite a negative 3 percent impact from declining premium rates and other market factors our overall organic growth comprised good growth in our global operations and many of our international operations partly offset by declines in our north america uk and irish retail operations reflecting the weak economic environments and soft market conditions experienced in these territories 

 

 

general and administrative expenses 

 

 

 

 

 

business discussion 

 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

salaries and benefits 

 

salaries and benefits were 56 percent of revenues for both 2010 and 2009 as the benefits of 

 

  

were offset by 

 

 

cash retention awards 

 

we have a cash retention award program in place we started making cash retention awards in 2005 to a small number of employees with the success of the program we have expanded it over time to include more staff and we believe it is a contributing factor to the reduction in employee turnover we have seen in recent years 

 

salaries and benefits do not reflect the unamortized portion of annual cash retention awards made to employees employees must repay a proportionate amount of these cash retention awards if they voluntarily leave our employ other than in the event of retirement or permanent disability before a certain time period currently three years we make cash payments to our employees in the year we grant these retention awards and recognize these payments ratably over the period they are subject to repayment beginning in the quarter in which the award is made a significant majority of the company’s incentive compensation for nonproduction compensation is paid in the form of a retention payment versus bonus awards which typically are made for prior service and accrued over the prior service period 

 

during 2010 we made 196 million of cash retention payments compared with 148 million in 2009 salaries and benefits in 2010 include 119 million of amortization of cash retention payments made on or before december 31 2010 compared with 88 million in 2009 as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 we included 173 million and 98 million respectively in other assets on the balance sheet which represented the unamortized portion of cash retention payments made on or before those dates 

 

 

other expenses 

 

 

other expenses were 17 percent of revenues in 2010 compared with 18 percent in 2009 reflecting the benefits of

salaries and benefits 

 

salaries and benefits were 56 percent of revenues for 2009 compared with 58 percent in 2008 reflecting the benefits of 

 

 

partly offset by 

 

  

effective may 15 2009 we closed our us defined benefit pension plan to future accrual and recognized a curtailment gain of 12 million in second quarter 2009 as a result the full year 2009 charge for the us plan was 7 million compared with an expected 39 million charge had the plan not been closed to future accrual 

 

we also suspended the company match for our us 401k plan which benefited 2009 by 9 million compared with 2008 

 

 

uk salary sacrifice scheme 

 

 

with effect from april 2009 the company offered uk employees an alternative basis on which to fund contributions into the uk pension plans uk employees can now agree to sacrifice an amount of their salary and in return the company makes additional pension contributions on their behalf equivalent to the value of the salary sacrificed 

from a payroll tax perspective this is a more efficient method of making pension contributions 

 

as a result of this change the company made additional pension contributions of 10 million in 2010 and 8 million in 2009 with marginally higher savings in salaries and payroll taxes 

 

 

other expenses 

 

 

other expenses were 18 percent of revenues for 2009 compared with 21 percent in 2008 reflecting the benefit of 

 

  

partly offset by 

  

we have a program that hedges our sterling cash outflows from our london market operations a part of which hedges the sterling denominated cash contributions into the uk pension plan however we do not hedge against the pension benefits asset or liability recognized for accounting purposes 

 

the effects of the above increases were partly mitigated by the benefits of our continued focus on cost controls 

 

 

 

business discussion 

 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

amortization of intangible assets of 82 million in 2010 was 18 million lower than in 2009 

 

the decrease primarily reflects the year over year benefit of the 2009 accelerated amortization of 7 million relating to the hrh brand name and the declining charge for the amortization of the hrh customer relationship intangible which is being amortized in line with the underlying discounted cash flows 

 

we expect the amortization of intangible assets expense in 2011 to further decrease to approximately 65 million 

 

amortization of intangible assets of 100 million in 2009 was 64 million higher than in 2008 the 

significant year over year increase was primarily attributable to additional charges of 58 million in 2009 in respect of intangible assets recognized on the hrh acquisition including 7 million of accelerated amortization relating to the hrh brand name following the success of our integration of hrh into our previously existing north america operations we announced on october 1 2009 that we were changing the name of our north america operations from willis hrh to willis north america consequently the intangible asset recognized on the acquisition of hrh relating to the hrh brand name was fully amortized

interest expense 

 

 

 

 

interest expense in 2010 of 166 million was 8 lower than in 2009 as the benefit of the interest expense savings arising from the year over year reduction in average term loan and revolving credit facility balances was partly offset by the effect of the higher coupon payable on the 500 million of 12875 senior unsecured notes issued in march 2009 

 

we are reviewing our current debt profile to identify opportunities to reduce our financing costs by taking advantage of current low global interest rates 

interest expense in 2009 of 174 million was 69 million higher than in 2008 this increase primarily reflects higher average debt levels following the hrh acquisition but also includes 5 million of premium and costs relating to the early repurchase in september 2009 of 160 million of our 5125 senior notes due july 2010 at a premium of 2750 per 1000 face value

excluding the benefit of these items the underlying effective tax rate for 2009 was 26 percent 

 

 

interest in earnings of associates 

 

 

interest in earnings of associates net of tax in 2010 of 23 million was 10 million lower than in 2009 this fall is primarily driven by the reduction from 49 percent to 31 percent in our ownership interest in gras savoye as part of the reorganization of their capital structure in december 2009 interest receivable on the vendor financing we provided as part of the capital reorganization is also recorded under this caption 

interest in earnings of associates net of tax was 33 million in 2009 11 million higher than in 2008 reflecting a year over year increased ownership share in gras savoye as described above our interest in gras savoye subsequently reduced in december 2009 following the reorganization of that company’s capital

willis group holdings plc 

 

foreign currency translation excluding the impact of the venezuelan currency devaluation had a 004 favorable impact on diluted earnings per share this was more than offset by the 007 per diluted share negative impact from the venezuela currency devaluation in january 2010 

average share count for 2010 was 171 million compared with 169 million in 2009 the increased share count had a negative 003 impact on diluted earnings per share 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

 

net income from continuing operations for 2009 was 436 million compared with 302 million in 2008 the 134 million increase primarily reflected the 191 million increase in operating income discussed above partly offset by the 69 million increase in interest expense 

 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2009 increased to 258 compared to 204 in 2008 as the benefit of the increased net 

income was partly offset by a 21 million increase in average diluted shares outstanding due primarily to the shares issued on october 1 2008 for the hrh acquisition the additional shares issued had a negative 036 impact on earnings per diluted share in 2009 

 

foreign currency translation had a year over year 027 positive impact on earnings per diluted share in 2009

revenues 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

 

commissions and fees of 873 million were 51 million or 6 percent higher in 2010 compared with 2009 which was driven by 6 percent organic revenue growth with a 1 percent benefit from acquisitions and disposals offset by the impact of foreign currency translation 

 

our reinsurance and global specialties businesses both reported midsingle digit organic growth in 2010 driven by good net new business generation despite the adverse impact of the continued difficult rate environment and soft market in many of the specialty classes 

 

reinsurance reported strong new business growth across all segments in 2010 and client retention levels remained high despite high loss levels earlier in the year rates remain soft except for marine and energy 

 

organic growth in global specialties was led by strong contributions from financial and executive risks construction and energy reflecting strong new business improved retention targeted hiring of producer talent and global connectivity however the operating environment remains tough with depressed world trade and transit volumes industry 

consolidation and pressure on financing of construction projects still evident 

 

as a result of strong reinsurance underwriting profits in 2009 with the exception of marine and energy there has been a general but disciplined softening of rates in 2010 which remain a significant headwind for growth 

 

our wcma business also contributed to positive organic revenue growth in 2010 substantially due to a 9 million fee on a single capital markets transaction in the second quarter wcma is a transaction oriented business and its results are more variable than some of our other businesses 

 

faber  dumas revenues were slightly lower than 2009 mainly reflecting the soft wholesale market together with continued pressure on the most economically sensitive lines such as bloodstock jewelry and fine arts 

 

productivity in global measured in terms of revenue per fte employee increased to 365000 for 2010 compared with 358000 for 2009 

 

client retention levels remained high at 90 percent for 2010 in line with 2009 

 

 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

 

 

commissions and fees of 822 million were 38 million or 5 percent higher in 2009 compared with 2008 of which 4 percent was attributable to the acquisition of the hrh uk wholesale business glencairn and 4 percent to organic revenue growth 

these were partly offset by a 3 percent negative impact from foreign exchange movements 

 

net new business growth was 5 percent and there was a 1 percent adverse impact from rates and other market factors reinsurance led the growth in net new business global specialties organic revenues 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

were slightly higher than in 2008 as growth in marine aerospace and financial and executive risks was offset by reductions elsewhere there was continued softness in most specialty rates although there were some signs of stabilization and firming in some areas including aerospace and energy the 

faber  dumas businesses continue to be adversely impacted by the weakening economic environment 

 

there was a sharp decline in investment income in 2009 compared with 2008 as global interest rates fell markedly in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 

 

operating margin 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

 

 

operating margin was 30 percent in 2010 compared with 31 percent in 2009 this decrease primarily reflected the adverse impact of foreign currency translation as the positive effect on our pound sterling expense base of a strengthening us dollar was more than offset by the adverse impact of foreign currency movements on sterlingdenominated balances 

 

operating margin in global is impacted by foreign exchange movements as the london market businesses within our global operations earn 

revenues in us dollars pounds sterling and euros and primarily incur expenses in pounds sterling in addition they are exposed to exchange risk on certain sterlingdenominated balances 

 

excluding the impact of this foreign currency translation global’s operating margin remained flat as the benefits of good organic revenue growth and disciplined cost control were offset by the impact of costs associated with continued support of current and future growth 

 

 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

 

 

operating margin was 31 percent in 2009 compared with 29 percent in 2008 this improvement reflected a significant benefit from foreign currency translation together with organic revenue growth particularly driven by our reinsurance business and 

good cost controls including a reduction in discretionary expenses 

 

the benefit of these was partly offset by a significant increase in the uk pension expense and a sharp reduction in investment income

north america 

 

our north america business provides risk management insurance brokerage related risk services and employee benefits brokerage and consulting to a wide array of industry and client segments in the united states and canada 

the following table sets out revenues organic revenue growth and operating income and margin for the three years ended december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

 

revenues 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

 

 

commissions and fees of 1359 million were 9 million or 1 percent lower for 2010 compared with 2009 

 

excluding the 16 million decrease in legacy contingency commissions assumed as part of the hrh acquisition there was a modest increase in commissions and fees 

 

organic revenue growth was flat for 2010 as the benefits of 

 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

net new business growth includes the benefit of higher standard commissions where these have been negotiated in lieu of contingent commissions these 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

higher standard commissions however may not have been negotiated at the same level or be received in the same periods as the related contingent commissions furthermore the business to which they related may not have been renewed 

despite the small decline in revenues productivity in north america measured in terms of revenue per fte employee increased to 238000 for 2010 compared with 227000 for 2009 

 

client retention levels increased to 92 percent for 2010 compared with 91 percent for 2009 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

 

 

commissions and fees in north america were 51 percent higher in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting the uplift from the additional revenues of hrh partly offset by 3 percent negative organic growth our north america operations were significantly adversely impacted by soft market conditions the weakened us economy and a reduction in project based revenues which more than offset a positive impact from net new business in particular our construction division saw significant declines 

our primary focus in north america in 2009 was the integration of hrh into our existing operations and the improvement of margin additionally in the second half of the year we refocused our efforts on revenue growth and we believe this led to double digit new business generation in parts of the business during that time period 

 

despite the significant decline in revenues our productivity measured in terms of revenue per fte employee remained high with a marginal increase to 227000 for 2009 compared with 225000 for 2008 

 

 

operating margin 

 

2010 compared with 2009

international 

 

our international business comprises our retail operations in eastern and western europe the united kingdom and ireland asiapacific russia the middle east south africa and latin america the services provided are focused according to the characteristics of each market and vary across offices but generally include direct risk 

management and insurance brokerage and employee benefits consulting

revenues 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

 

 

commissions and fees of 1068 million were 48 million or 5 percent higher for 2010 compared with 2009 as the benefits of 6 percent organic revenue growth and 1 percent from the net effect of acquisitions and disposals was partly offset by a 2 percent adverse impact from foreign currency translation net new business growth was 9 percent and there was a negative 3 percent impact from rates and other market factors 

 

a significant part of international’s revenues are earned in currencies other than the us dollar the us dollar has strengthened against a number of these currencies in 2010 compared with 2009 most notably the euro venezuelan bolivar fuerte danish kroner and pound sterling the adverse impact of this strengthening was partly offset by the weakening of the us dollar against the australian dollar the net impact of these movements was a 2 percent reduction in 2010 revenues compared to 2009 

 

there were strong contributions to our organic growth from most regions led by growth in latin 

america asia and europe in particular there was good growth in 

 

  

there was further positive growth in our eastern europe operations in 2010 driven by a strong contribution from russia 

 

organic revenue growth was also positive in our uk and irish retail operations driven by new business growth in the uk as we begin to see signs of an improving economy our employee benefits practice which represents approximately 10 percent of international commissions and fees continued to perform well in 2010 with growth in the mid single digits 

 

productivity in our international business measured in terms of revenue per fte employee increased to

160000 for 2010 compared with 156000 for 2009 

client retention levels remained high at 92 percent for 2010 

 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

 

 

commissions and fees in international were 35 million or 3 percent lower in 2009 compared with 2008 as double digit new business generation in many of our international units was more than offset by an adverse impact from foreign exchange of 8 percent a 3 percent adverse impact from rates and other market factors and significantly lower revenues in our uk and irish retail operations 

 

a significant part of international’s revenues are earned in currencies other than the us dollar which strengthened significantly in 2009 on a year over year basis against a number of these currencies most notably the euro pound sterling danish kroner and australian dollar consequently reducing 

international revenues on a year over year basis when reported in us dollars 

 

despite the slowdown of the global economy international continued its organic growth excluding our uk and irish retail divisions organic revenue growth was 8 percent in 2009 with latin america and asia led by brazil columbia and china all reporting strong organic growth however our uk and irish retail division saw a 6 percent revenue decline reflecting weak local economic conditions 

 

client retention levels remained high at approximately 90 percent for 2009

corporate  other 

 

corporate  other includes the following 

 

 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

 

our accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the 

presentation of our financial condition or operating performance management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our audit committee 

 

 

 

pension expense 

 

 

 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the us and uk both these plans are now closed to new entrants and with effect from may 15 2009 we closed our us defined benefit plan to future accrual new entrants in the uk are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the united states are offered the opportunity to join a 401k plan we also have smaller defined benefit schemes in ireland germany norway and the netherlands these international schemes have combined total assets of 125 million and a combined net liability for pension benefits of 10 million as of december 31 2010 elsewhere pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans 

 

we make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate the discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as 

longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination 

 

we recorded a net pension charge on our uk and us defined benefit pension plans in 2010 of 29 million compared with 32 million in 2009 a decrease of 3 million 

 

on our international defined benefit pension plans we recorded a net pension charge of 6 million in 2010 compared with 10 million in 2009 a decrease of 4 million 

 

the uk plan charge was 3 million higher as the benefit of higher asset returns from higher asset levels was more than offset by 

 

 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

  

the us pension charge was 6 million lower in 2010 compared with 2009 reflecting 

 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

based on december 31 2010 assumptions we expect the net pension charge in 2011 to decrease by 20 million for the uk plan 1 million for the us plan and a net 2 million for the international plans 

 

uk plan 

 

 

 

  

 

expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net uk pension expense in 2010 remained unchanged at 78 percent equivalent to an expected return in 2010 of 141 million 

effective january 1 2011 the expected longterm rate of return was decreased to 750 following a change in the underlying target asset mix 

 

the expected and actual returns on uk plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

during the latter half of 2008 the value of assets held by our uk pension plan was significantly adversely affected by the turmoil in worldwide markets the holdings of equity securities were particularly affected in 2008 but have recovered to some extent in 2009 and 2010 

 

rates used to discount pension plan liabilities at december 31 2010 were based on yields prevailing at that date of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity the selected rate used to discount uk plan liabilities was 55 percent compared with 58 percent at december 31 2009 

with the decrease reflecting a reduction in uk longterm bond rates in the latter part of 2010 this lower discount rate generated an actuarial loss of 84 million at december 31 2010 

 

mortality assumptions at december 31 2010 were unchanged from december 31 2009 the mortality assumption is the 100 percent pna00 table without an age adjustment as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a uk male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2010 would have a life expectancy of 22 years 

 

 

 

business discussion 

 

us plan 

 

 

 

 

  

the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net us pension scheme expense in 2010 was 80 percent consistent with 2009 effective january 1 2011 the expected longterm rate of return was decreased to 750 following a change in the underlying target asset mix 

 

the rate used to discount us plan liabilities at december 31 2010 was 56 percent determined 

based on expected plan cash flows discounted using a corporate bond yield curve a small reduction from 61 percent at december 31 2009 

 

the expected and actual returns on us plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

as for the uk plan the 2008 actual return on assets was adversely impacted by the turmoil in worldwide markets 

 

the mortality assumption at december 31 2010 is the rp2000 mortality table blended for annuitants and nonannuitants projected to 2011 by scale aa 

december 31 2009 projected to 2010 by scale aa as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a us male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2010 would have a life expectancy of 19 years 

 

 

 

intangible assets 

 

 

 

intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of businesses acquired we classify our intangible assets into three categories 

 

  

client relationships acquired on the hrh acquisition are amortized over twenty years in line with the 

pattern in which the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected to be consumed over 80 percent of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized after 10 years noncompete agreements acquired in connection with the hrh acquisition were amortized over two years on a straight line basis intangible assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis goodwill is not subject to amortization 

 

to determine the allocation of intangible assets between goodwill and other intangible assets and the estimated useful lives in respect of the hrh 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

acquisition we considered a report produced by a qualified independent appraiser the calculation of the allocation is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions we base our allocation on 

assumptions we believe to be reasonable however changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

goodwill impairment review 

 

 

we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred application of the impairment test requires judgment including 

 

  

the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and in aggregate validated against our market capitalization this analysis requires significant judgments including 

 

 

  

we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable however changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and result in a goodwill impairment 

 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed during the fourth quarter of 2010 showed the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying values and therefore did not result in an impairment charge 2009 nil 2008 nil 

 

 

income taxes 

 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards we estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies 

 

at december 31 2010 we had gross deferred tax assets of 294 million 2009 390 million against which a valuation allowance of 87 million 2009 92 million had been recognized to the extent that 

 

 

  

we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income 

 

positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities upon lapse of the relevant statute of limitations or when positions are effectively settled the benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts the company adjusts its recognition of 

 

business discussion 

 

these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions in 2010 7 million was released relating to uncertain tax positions due to the closure of the statute of limitations on assessments for previously unrecognized tax benefits there was a similar 

11 million release of uncertain tax positions in 2009 the company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

 

 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

 

 

 

we purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly over recent years we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and 

reinsurance in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice 

 

 

new accounting standards 

 

 

there were no new accounting standards issued during the year that would have a significant impact on the company’s reporting 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

effective december 31 2010 we changed the presentation of certain items on our balance sheet uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers previously reported within accounts receivable are now recorded as fiduciary assets on the company’s consolidated balance sheets unremitted insurance premiums and 

claims ‘fiduciary funds’ are also recorded within fiduciary assets the obligations to remit these funds previously reported within accounts payable are now recorded as fiduciary liabilities on the company’s consolidated balance sheets accordingly prior year comparatives and commentary below have been recast to reflect this revised presentation 

 

 

 

we remain committed to our previously stated goals of ongoing debt repayment and returning capital to shareholders 

 

consistent with this strategy we are reviewing our current debt profile and subject to prevailing market conditions may seek to take advantage of attractive financing rates to reduce the cost and extend the maturity profile of our existing debt 

 

such actions may include redemption of the entire 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 12875 percent senior notes due 2016 if the 2016 senior notes are redeemed we anticipate that we would incur a onetime pretax charge of approximately 180 million relating to the makewhole premium provided under the terms of the 

indenture governing the notes as calculated at december 31 2010 

 

total debt as of december 31 2010 decreased to 23 billion compared with 24 billion at december 31 2009 

 

in 2010 we made 110 million of mandatory repayments against the 5year term loan thereby reducing the outstanding balance as at december 31 2010 to 411 million we also repurchased the remaining 90 million of 5125 senior notes due july 2010 and repaid in full a 9 million fixed rate loan due 2010 

 

in august 2010 we entered into a new revolving credit facility agreement under which a further 200 million is available this facility is in addition 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

to the remaining availability under our previously existing 300 million revolving credit facility 

 

in addition in june 2010 we entered into an additional facility solely for the use of our main uk regulated entity under which a further 20 million would be available in certain exceptional circumstances this facility is secured against the freehold of the uk regulated entity’s freehold property in ipswich 

at december 31 2010 we have nil outstanding under both the 200 million and the 20 million facilities and 90 million outstanding under our preexisting 300 million facility compared with nil at december 31 2009 

 

at december 31 2010 the only mandatory debt repayments falling due over the next 12 months are scheduled repayments on our 700 million 5year term loan totaling 110 million 

 

 

liquidity 

 

 

 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations cash and cash equivalents of 316 million at december 31 2010 and remaining availability of 430 million under our revolving credit facilities 

 

as of december 31 2010 our shortterm liquidity requirements consisted of 

 

 

our longterm liquidity requirements consist of 

 

  

based on current market conditions and information available to us at this time we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months 

 

we continue to identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance including future cash flow 

 

 

 

fiduciary funds 

 

 

 

as an intermediary we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers we report premiums which are held on account of or due from clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers claims held by or due to us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities 

fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity such funds are not available to service the company’s debt or for other corporate purposes notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers the company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and in some cases as supported by agreements with insureds 

 

 

 

own funds 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of 316 million compared with 221 million at december 31 2009 and 430 million

we made total cash contributions to our uk defined benefit pension plan of 88 million in 2010 including amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice contributions compared with 49 million in 2009 and 140 million in 2008 

 

the additional 39 million cash contribution in 2010 reflects an additional payment required under the uk plan’s funding strategy which we are required to agree with the plan’s trustees 

 

the funding strategy was agreed in february 2009 and requires full year contributions to the uk plan of 39 million for 2009 through 2012 excluding 

amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme in addition if certain funding targets were not met at the beginning of any of the following years 2010 through 2012 a further contribution of 39 million would be required for that year 

 

in 2010 the additional funding requirement was triggered and we expect to make a similar additional contribution in 2011 a similar additional contribution may also be required for 2012 depending on actual performance against funding targets at the beginning of 2012 

 

 

 

us plan 

 

 

 

we made total cash contributions to our us defined benefit pension plan of 30 million in 2010 compared with 27 million in 2009 and 8 million in 2008 

 

for the us plan expected contributions are the contributions we will be required to make under 

us pension legislation based on our december 31 2010 balance sheet position we currently expect to contribute 30 million in 2011 

 

 

 

international plans 

 

 

 

we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of 12 million in 2010 compared with 6 million in both 2009 and 2008 

in 2011 we expect to contribute approximately 6 million to our international plans

net cash used in financing activities was 516 million in 2009 compared with an inflow of 808 million in 2008 

 

in march 2009 we issued 500 million of senior unsecured notes due 2016 at 12875 

 

we used the 482 million net proceeds of the notes together with 208 million cash generated from operating activities and 60 million cash in hand to 

pay down the 750 million outstanding on our interim credit facility as of december 31 2008 

 

in september 2009 we issued 300 million of 70 senior notes due 2019 we then launched a tender offer on september 22 2009 to repurchase any and all of our 250 million 5125 senior notes due july 2010 at a premium of 2750 per 1000 face value notes totaling approximately 160 million were tendered and repurchased on september 29 2009 

 

business discussion 

 

in december 2009 we applied the net cash proceeds of 155 million from the gras savoye transaction together with other cash in hand to reduce the balance outstanding on the 5year term loan by approximately 180 million to 

521 million of which 27 million related to our first mandatory debt repayment 

 

as of december 31 2009 there were no amounts outstanding under our 300 million revolving credit facility 2008 nil 

 

 

share buybacks 

 

 

 

we did not buyback any shares in 2010 or 2009 there remains 925 million under the current buyback authorization 

 

in 2008 we repurchased 23 million shares at a cost of 75 million

 item 7a — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

 

financial risk management 

 

 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 — basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements and further disclosure is provided in note 24 — derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

 

 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

 

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results 

 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the united states we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling 

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2010 

 

 

 

our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from 

 

  

 

london market operations 

 

 

in our london market operations we earn revenue in a number of different currencies principally us dollars pounds sterling euros and japanese yen but incur expenses almost entirely in pounds sterling 

 

we hedge this risk as follows 

 

 

generally it is our policy to hedge at least 25 percent of the next 12 months’ exposure in significant currencies we do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

 

in addition we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any net sterling asset or liability position in our london market operations where this risk relates to shortterm cash flows we hedge all or part of the risk by forward purchases or sales 

 

however where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit we do not hedge the risk consequently if our london market operations have a significant pension asset or liability we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the us dollar and pounds sterling exchange rate changes we do however hedge the pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan 

 

 

 

market risk 

 

translation risk 

 

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower 

 

we do not hedge translation risk 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within three years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the uk is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income 

of these entities the company does not hedge net income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the uk 

 

 

interest rate risk management 

 

 

our operations are financed principally by 1750 million fixed rate senior notes issued by subsidiaries and 411 million under a 5year term loan facility of the fixed rate senior notes 

350 million are due 2015 500 million are due 2016 600 million are due 2017 and 300 million are due 2019 the 5year term loan facility amortizes at the rate of 27 million per quarter as of 

 

willis group holdings plc 

 

december 31 2010 we had access to 520 million under revolving credit facilities of which 90 million has been drawn the interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown 

 

we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in both us dollars and pounds sterling 

 

as a consequence of our insurance and reinsurance broking activities there is a delay between the time we receive cash for premiums and claims and the time the cash needs to be paid we earn interest on this float which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income 

 

this float is regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which it may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity we manage the interest rate risk arising from this exposure primarily through the use of interest rate swaps it is our policy that for currencies with significant balances a minimum of 25 percent of forecast income arising is hedged for each of the next three years 

 

during the year ended december 31 2010 the company entered into a series of interest rate swaps 

for a total notional amount of 350 million to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semiannual basis with a maturity date of july 15 2015 the company has designated and accounts for these instruments as fair value hedges against its 350 million 5625 senior notes due 2015 the fair values of the interest rate swaps are included within other assets or other liabilities and the fair value of the hedged element of the senior notes is included within the principal amount of the debt 

 

the table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for interest rate swaps the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts the duration of interest rate swaps varies between one and five years with refixing periods of three to six months average fixed and variable rates are respectively the weightedaverage actual and market rates for the interest hedges in place market rates are the rates prevailing at december 31 2010 or 2009 as appropriate

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the criteria related to internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued by the 

committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on our evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2010

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

to the board of directors and stockholders of willis group holdings public limited company 

dublin ireland 

 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of willis group holdings public limited company and subsidiaries the ‘company’ as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2010 of the company and our report dated february 25 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

customers 

 

our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational corporations to middlemarket companies further many of our client relationships span decades for instance our relationship with the tokio marine and fire insurance company limited dates back over 100 years no one client accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues for fiscal year 2009 additionally we place insurance with over 5000 insurance carriers none of which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2009 

 

competition 

 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price according to the directory of agents and brokers published by business insurance in july 2009 the 150 largest 

commercial insurance brokers globally reported brokerage revenues totaling 40 billion in 2008 of which marsh  mclennan companies inc had approximately 29 percent aon corporation had approximately 18 percent and willis had approximately 8 percent 

 

we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms 

 

insurance companies also compete with brokers by directly soliciting insureds without the assistance of an independent broker or agent 

 

competition for business is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers many insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies are increasingly relying upon captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buying insurance 

 

additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

 

in 2005 we along with marsh  mclennan and aon agreed to implement certain business reforms which included codification of our voluntary termination of contingent commission arrangements with insurers however most other special regional and local insurance brokers continued to accept contingent compensation and did not disclose the compensation received in connection with providing policy placement services to its customers in february 2010 we entered into the amended and restated assurance of discontinuance with the attorney general of the state of new york and the amended and restated stipulation with the superintendent of insurance of the state of new york which ended many of the requirements previously imposed upon us the new agreement no longer limits the type of compensation we can receive and lowers the compensation disclosure requirements we must make to our clients 

our position is to refuse to accept contingent commissions from carriers in our retail brokerage business we seek to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to our clients and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of valueadded risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities although we continue to believe in the success of our strategy we cannot be certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable organic revenue growth 

 

regulation 

 

our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasigovernmental regulatory supervision in virtually all countries in which we operate also such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities while these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria 

 

united states 

 

our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the united states are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction insurance laws in the united states are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions 

 

european union 

 

the european union insurance mediation directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the eu on a basis 

consistent with the eu single market and customer protection aims each eu member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence good repute professional indemnity cover and financial capacity 

 

united kingdom 

 

in the united kingdom the statutory body is the financial services authority ‘fsa’ the fsa has prescribed the methods by which our insurance and reinsurance operations are to conduct business and has a wide range of rulemaking investigatory and enforcement powers aimed at meeting its overall aim of promoting efficient orderly and fair markets and helping retail consumers achieve a fair deal the fsa conducts monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements 

 

certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment and securities licensing authorities in the united states willis capital markets operates through our whollyowned subsidiary willis securities inc a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member finrasipc primarily in connection with investment bankingrelated services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions willis capital markets provides advice on securities or investments in the eu through our whollyowned 

subsidiary willis structured financial solutions limited which is authorized and regulated by the fsa 

 

our failure or that of our employees to satisfy the regulators that we are in compliance with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities can result in disciplinary action fines reputational damage and financial harm 

 

all companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the united states and united kingdom we do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position 

 

see part i item 1a — risk factors ‘legal and regulatory risks’ for discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 17000 employees worldwide of whom approximately 3500 were employed in the united kingdom and 6700 in the united states with the balance being employed across the rest of the world in addition our associates had approximately 3200 employees all of whom were located outside the united kingdom and the united states

risks relating to our business and the insurance industry 

 

this section describes material risks affecting the group’s business these risks could materially affect the group’s business its revenues operating income net income net assets liquidity and capital resources and ability to achieve its financial targets and accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k 

 

competitive risks 

 

worldwide economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

our business and operating results are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions current global economic conditions coupled with declining customer and business confidence increasing energy prices and other challenges may have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from these conditions in particular financial institutions construction aviation and logistics businesses such as marine cargo are most likely to be affected further the global economic downturn is also negatively affecting some of the international economies that have supported the strong growth in our international operations our employee benefits practice may also be adversely affected as businesses continue to downsize during this period of economic turmoil in addition a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business while it is difficult to predict consequences of any further deterioration in global economic conditions on our business any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

the potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and 

profitability the potential for an insurer to fail could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients 

 

since 2008 we have launched certain initiatives such as right sizing willis and shaping our future to achieve costsavings or fund our future growth plans in light of the global economic uncertainty we continue to vigorously manage our cost base in order to fund further growth initiatives but we cannot be certain whether we will be able to realize any further benefits from these initiatives or any new initiatives that we may implement 

 

we do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability 

 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services we do not determine insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions from the late 1980s through late 2000 insurance premium rates generally declined as a result of a number of factors including the expanded underwriting capacity of insurance carriers consolidation of both insurance intermediaries and insurance carriers and increased competition among insurance carriers from 2000 to 2003 we benefitted from a ‘hard’ market with premium rates stable or increasing during 2004 we saw a rapid transition from a hard market with premium rates stable or increasing to a ‘soft’ market with premium rates falling in most markets the soft market continued to have an adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin from 2005 through 2008 rates continued to decline in most sectors through 2005 and 2006 with the exception of catastropheexposed markets in 2007 the market softened further with decreases in many of the market sectors in which we operated and this continued into 2008 with further premium rate declines averaging 10 percent across our market sectors in 2009 the benefit of rate increases in the reinsurance market and stabilization in some specialty markets was offset by the continuing soft market in other sectors and the adverse impact of the weakened economic environment across the globe our north america and uk and irish retail operations have been particularly impacted by the 

weakened economic climate and continued soft market with no material improvement in rates across most sectors this has resulted in declines in 2009 revenues in these operations particularly amongst our smaller clients who are especially vulnerable to the economic downturn 

 

in addition as traditional riskbearing insurance carriers continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated agents or brokers such as ourselves those insurance carriers may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

 

competition in our industry is intense and if we are unable to compete effectively we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two other providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms competition for business is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market and the other two providers of global risk management services have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers many insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies have been increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buying insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

 

in 2005 we along with marsh mclennan and aon agreed to implement certain business reforms which included codification of our voluntary termination 

of contingent commission arrangements with insurers however most other special regional and local insurance brokers continued to accept contingent compensation and did not disclose the compensation received in connection with providing policy placement services to its customers in february 2010 we entered into the amended and restated assurance of discontinuance with the attorney general of the state of new york and the amended and restated stipulation with the superintendent of insurance of the state of new york which ended many of the requirements previously imposed upon us the new agreement no longer limits the type of compensation we will receive and lowers the compensation disclosure requirements we must make to our clients 

 

our position is to refuse to accept contingent commissions from carriers in our retail brokerage business we seek to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to our clients and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of valueadded risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities although we continue to believe in the success of our strategy we cannot be certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable organic revenue growth if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors who are or may accept contingent commissions we may suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

dependence on key personnel — the loss of our chairman and chief executive officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives 

 

the loss of our chairman and chief executive officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our chairman and chief executive officer joseph j plumeri and other members of our senior management but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships the insurance and reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense competition for the services of 

leading individual brokers and brokerage teams and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand train and manage our employee base we may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense 

 

legal and regulatory risks 

 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states the united kingdom and the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate compliance with laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include insurance industry regulations economic and trade sanctions and laws against financial crimes such as money laundering bribery or other corruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act in most jurisdictions governmental and regulatory authorities have the authority to interpret or amend these laws and regulations and could impose penalties for noncompliance including sanctions or civil remedies fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients 

 

given the increase in focus and developments in these laws over the last few years in general and the interest expressed by uk and us regulators in the effectiveness of compliance controls relating to financial crime in our market sector in particular we began a voluntary internal review of our policies and controls three years ago this ongoing review includes analysis and advice from external experts on best practices review of public regulatory decisions and ongoing discussions with government regulators in the uk and us we believe our compliance policies controls and programs are 

effective and we make all reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations but given the complex nature of these laws and regulations we cannot assure the complete adequacy of our policies and controls or that at all times we have been or are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance could adversely affect our business and results of operations and expose us to negative publicity reputational damage or harm to our client or employee relationships 

 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings 

 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist our clients with matters including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims involving substantial amounts of money errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include allegations of damages for our employees or subagents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis errors and omissions claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly in recent years in respect of selfinsured risks we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be 

adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience 

 

we are also subject to actual and potential claims lawsuits investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims the material actual or potential claims lawsuits and proceedings to which we are currently subject including but not limited to errors and omissions claims are 1 legal proceedings and investigations relating to contingent commission arrangements ‘bid rigging’ and ‘tying’ 2 potential claims arising out of various legal proceedings between reinsurers reinsureds and their reinsurance brokers relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance placements for the years 1993 to 1998 3 potential damages arising out of a court action on behalf of a purported class of present and former female officer and officer equivalent employees for alleged discrimination against them on the basis of their gender 4 claims with respect to our placement of property and casualty insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted by the september 11 2001 destruction of new york’s world trade center complex and 5 claims relating to the collapse of the stanford financial group for which we acted as brokers of record on certain lines of insurance 

 

the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may also be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business client or employee relationships 

interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing systems could cause material financial loss loss of human resources regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage retrieval processing and management of information our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and to develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards the acquisition of hrh and additional information systems has added to this exposure if the information we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems either through a telecommunications failure if we fail to replace redundant or obsolete computer applications or software systems or if we experience other disruptions this could result in material financial loss regulatory action reputational harm or legal liability 

 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

 

our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected even in the shortterm by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located this may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site access terrorist activities disease pandemics or outages to electrical communications or other services used by our company our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other 

significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information in our database however we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we maintain in our databases and protect it from theft or inadvertent loss in such circumstances we may be held liable to our clients which could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue further database privacy identity theft and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace 

 

financial risks 

 

we face certain risks associated with any acquisition or disposition of business or reorganization of existing investments 

 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we may acquire or dispose of or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate opportunities negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions once we complete acquisitions or reorganizations such as the hrh acquisition or gras savoye transaction there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction including revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies for example if we fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from the hrh transaction goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired in future periods in addition we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we could incur or assume unknown or 

unanticipated liabilities or contingencies which may impact our results of operations if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce overheads related to the divested assets 

 

our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 24 billion and our 2009 interest expense of 174 million is 69 million higher than in 2008 although management believes that our cash flows will be more than adequate to service this debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may 

 

  

the terms of our current financings also include certain limitations for example the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated adjusted ebitda to consolidated fixed charges and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated ebitda in each case subject to certain adjustments 

 

a failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could 

require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our pension liabilities may increase which could require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans 

 

we have two principal defined benefit plans one in the united kingdom and the other in the united states cash contributions of approximately 122 million will be required in 2010 for our pension plans although we may elect to contribute more total cash contributions to these defined benefit pension plans in 2009 were 74 million future estimates are based on certain assumptions including discount rates interest rates fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets following changes to uk pension legislation in 2005 we are now required to agree to a funding strategy for our uk defined benefit plan with the plan’s trustees in february 2009 we agreed to make full year contributions to the uk plan of 40 million for 2009 through 2012 excluding those contributions made under our salary sacrifice scheme in addition as certain funding targets have not been met at the beginning of 2010 a further contribution of 40 million is required for 2010 a similar additional contribution may also be required for 2011 depending on actual performance against funding targets at the beginning of 2011 we have taken actions to manage our pension liabilities including closing our uk and us plans to new participants and restricting final pensionable salaries 

 

the determinations of pension expense and pension funding are based on a variety of rules and regulations changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets they may also result in higher pension costs additional financial statement disclosure and accelerate and increase the need to fully fund our pension plans our future required cash contributions to our us and uk defined benefit pension plans may increase based on the funding reform provisions that were enacted into law further a significant decline in the value of 

investments that fund our pension plan if not offset or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities may significantly differ from or alter the values and actuarial assumptions used to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required to fund our plan with significant amounts of cash in addition if the us pension benefit guaranty corporation requires additional contributions to such plans or if other actuarial assumptions are modified our future required cash contributions could increase the need to make these cash contributions may reduce the cash available to meet our other obligations including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other longterm debt or to meet the needs of our business 

 

in addition to the critical assumptions described above our plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan participants and surviving spouses periodic revision of those assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pension expense changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees as a result there can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those which have been estimated 

 

we could incur substantial losses if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations failed 

 

the deterioration of the global credit and financial markets has created challenging conditions for financial institutions including depositories as the fallout from the credit crisis persists the financial strength of these institutions may continue to decline we maintain cash balances at various us depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the us federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits we also maintain cash balances in foreign financial institutions if one or more of the institutions in which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility 

 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility in addition certain downgrades would trigger a stepup in interest rates under the indenture for our 62 senior notes due 2017 and our 70 senior notes due 2019 which would increase our interest expense if we need to raise capital in the future any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources 

 

international risks 

 

our significant nonus operations particularly our london market operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the united states accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in our london market operations however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside the united states and our london market operations we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency the table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2009 

 

 

 

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars we 

are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses together with any net sterling balance sheet position we hold in our us dollar denominated london market operations creates an exchange exposure 

 

for example as the pound sterling strengthens the us dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase which then causes our results to be negatively impacted our results may also be adversely impacted if we are holding a net sterling position in our us dollar denominated london market operations if the pound sterling weakens any net sterling asset we are holding will be less valuable when translated into us dollars given these facts the strength of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results this risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations in the future 

 

where possible we hedge part of our operating exposure to exchange rate movements but such mitigating attempts may not be successful 

 

in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries 

 

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to political economic legal market nationalization operational and other risks our businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets and we expect this trend to continue the possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses these risks include 

 

 

  

legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us and our effective tax rate may increase 

 

there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate which include the potential legislative actions described below and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate for example legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which we rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions including the us we could be subjected to increased taxation in 

addition any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between ireland and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased taxation 

 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not be directly enforceable in ireland 

 

as an irish company willis group holdings is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of willis group holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states

market information 

 

our shares have been traded on the new york stock exchange ‘nyse’ under the symbol ‘wsh’ since june 11 2001 the high and low sale prices of our shares as reported by the nyse are set forth below for the periods indicated including trading of the common shares of willisbermuda through december 31 2009 and trading of the ordinary shares of willis group holdings after that date 

 

 

 

on february 22 2010 the last reported sale price of our shares as reported by the nyse was 2896 per share as of february 22 2010 there were approximately 2080 shareholders of record of our shares 

 

dividends 

 

we normally pay dividends on a quarterly basis to shareholders of record on march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 the dividend payment dates and amounts are as follows 

 

 

on february 2 2010 subject to the irish high court approving a reduction of our share capital in order to create distributable reserves which under irish law are required to facilitate the payment of a dividend and compliance generally with the requirements of the irish companies acts relating to the payment of dividends our board of directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend of 026 per share which will be payable on april 16 2010 to shareholders of record on march 31 2010 

 

subject to the above there are no governmental laws decrees or regulations in ireland which will restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to nonresident holders of the company’s shares 

 

in circumstances where one of ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax ‘dwt’ does not apply dividends paid by the company will be subject to irish dwt currently 20 residents of the us should be exempted from irish dwt provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of irish dwt in prescribed circumstances it should generally be unnecessary for us residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from dwt available under irish domestic law irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the company however us residents entitled to an exemption from irish dwt generally have no irish income tax liability on dividends an exception to this position applies where a shareholder holds shares in the company through a branch or agency in ireland through which a trade is carried on 

 

with respect to noncorporate us shareholders certain dividends received before january 1 2009 from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states such as our shares noncorporate us shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income 

as ‘investment income’ pursuant to section 163d4 of the code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation in addition the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property this disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met noncorporate us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances

the following sales of shares related to partial consideration for the acquisition of interests in the following companies to their former shareholders other than for the company last listed which related to full consideration for the shares acquired 

 

 

 

in connection with the redomicile willisireland issued a total of approximately 168645200 ordinary shares to holders of willisbermuda common shares immediately prior to the effective time the terms and conditions of the issuance of the securities were sanctioned by the supreme court of bermuda after a hearing upon the fairness of such terms and conditions at which all willisbermuda shareholders had a right to appear and of which adequate notice had been given the issuance was exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of by virtue of section 3a10 of the securities act

redomicile 

 

 

on september 24 2009 willisireland was incorporated in ireland to facilitate the redomicile of the group’s parent company from bermuda to ireland willisireland operated as a whollyowned subsidiary of willisbermuda until the effective time when the outstanding common shares of willisbermuda were canceled and willisireland issued ordinary shares with substantially the same rights and preferences on a oneforone basis to the holders of the willisbermuda common shares that were canceled upon completion of this transaction willisireland replaced willisbermuda as the ultimate parent company of the group and willisbermuda became a whollyowned subsidiary of 

willisireland we do not expect the redomicile to have a material impact on our financial results we remain subject to the sec reporting requirements the mandates of the sarbanesoxley act and applicable corporate governance rules of the nyse and we continue to report our consolidated financial results in us dollars and in accordance with us gaap we also comply with any additional reporting requirements of irish law the shares of willisireland are traded on the nyse under the symbol ‘wsh’ the same symbol under which willisbermuda shares traded prior to the effective time 

 

 

business overview and market outlook 

 

 

we provide a broad range of insurance broking risk management and consulting services to our clients worldwide our core specialty businesses include aerospace energy marine construction financial and executive risks fine art jewelry and specie special contingency risks and reinsurance our retail operations provide services to small medium and major corporations and the employee benefits practice our largest productbased practice group provides health welfare and human resources consulting and brokerage services 

 

in our capacity as advisor and insurance broker we act as an intermediary between our clients and 

insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements helping clients determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network 

 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations commission levels generally 

follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums they may vary widely between accounting periods reductions in premium rates leading to downward pressure on commission revenues a ‘soft’ market can have a potentially material impact on our commission revenues and operating margin 

 

a ‘hard’ market occurs when premium uplifting factors including a greater than anticipated loss experience or capital shortages more than offset any downward pressures on premiums this usually has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin 

 

from 2000 through 2003 we benefited from a hard market with premium rates stable or increasing during 2004 we saw a rapid transition from a hard market to a soft market with premium rates falling in most markets rates continued to decline in most sectors through 2005 and 2006 with the exception of catastropheexposed markets in 2007 the market softened further with decreases in many of the market sectors in which we operated and this 

continued into 2008 with further premium rate declines averaging 10 across our markets the soft market had an adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin from 2005 through 2008 

 

in 2009 the stabilization of rates in the reinsurance market and some specialty markets was offset by the continuing soft market in other sectors and the adverse impact of the weakened economic environment across the globe 

 

our north america and uk and irish retail operations have been particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market with no material improvement in rates across most sectors this has resulted in declines in 2009 revenues in these operations particularly amongst our smaller clients who are especially vulnerable to the economic downturn 

 

in 2010 our main priorities will include driving revenue growth continuing to execute our shaping our future initiative creating incremental savings to fund growth completing the hrh integration and leveraging our growth opportunities from our expanded footprint 

 

executive summary 

 

 

overview 

 

despite the difficult trading conditions in 2009 we reported 2 percent organic growth in commissions and fees in 2009 compared with 2008 this reflected growth in global operations in particular in reinsurance and many of our international businesses partly offset by a fall in organic commissions and fees in our north america uk and irish retail operations where revenues were adversely impacted by the continued soft market and weak economic conditions 

 

operating margin for full year 2009 was 21 percent compared with 18 percent for 2008 the increase over 2008 was attributable to organic growth in commissions and fees continuing control of costs and favorable foreign exchange movements offset by increased pension costs and amortization of intangible assets 

results from continuing operations 2009 compared with 2008 

 

net income from continuing operations in 2009 was 436 million or 258 per diluted share compared with 302 million or 204 per diluted share in 2008 this increase included organic growth in commissions and fees a reduction in costs associated with our 2008 expense review from 045 per diluted share in 2008 to 011 per diluted share for severance costs in 2009 and a onetime tax release in 2009 relating to a change in uk tax law in 2009 equivalent to 016 per diluted share 

 

total revenues from continuing operations at 3263 million for 2009 were 436 million or 15 percent higher than in 2008 organic revenue growth of 2 percent and a 19 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals in 2009 driven by the fourth quarter 2008 acquisition of hrh were partly offset by a negative 4 percent impact from foreign currency translation and a 31 million decrease in investment income compared to 2008 

organic revenue growth of 2 percent comprised 5 percent net new business growth which constitutes the revenue growth from business won over the course of the year net of the revenue from existing business lost and a 3 percent negative impact from declining premium rates and other market factors 

 

operating margin at 21 percent was 3 percentage points higher than in 2008 with the increase mainly reflecting 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

results from continuing operations 2008 compared with 2007 

 

net income from continuing operations in 2008 was 302 million or 204 per diluted share compared with 409 million or 278 per diluted share in 2007 the benefits of good organic revenue growth improved margins in our international and global operations and a lower effective tax rate were more than offset by a 045 per diluted share impact of charges for the 2008 expense review and a 027 per diluted share year over year impact from foreign exchange 

 

hrh’s fourth quarter results net of related funding costs and intangible asset amortization contributed 004 per diluted share new shares issued as part 

consideration for the hrh acquisition had an 011 dilutive impact on full year diluted earnings per share 

total revenues at 2827 million were 249 million or 10 percent higher than in 2007 organic revenue growth of 4 percent a 7 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals primarily reflecting the hrh acquisition and a 1 percentage point benefit from foreign currency translation were partly offset by lower investment and other income organic revenue growth of 4 percent reflected net new business growth of 6 percent and a 2 percent negative impact from declining rates and other market factors 

 

operating margin at 18 percent in 2008 was 6 percentage points lower than in 2007 with the decrease mainly reflecting 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

discontinued operations 

 

income from discontinued operations relates to the disposals of our bliss  glennon and managing agency group usbased wholesale insurance operations in the second and third quarters of 2009 respectively there were no net gains or losses recognized on these disposals these disposals were made as part of our plan to dispose of noncore hrh activities 

hrh acquisition and integration 

 

on october 1 2008 we completed the acquisition of hrh at the time the eighth largest insurance and risk management intermediary in the united states 

 

we remain confident that the acquisition of hrh 

 

  

the integration of hrh with the existing willis north america business was a key priority throughout 2009 and the process is now substantially complete we believe that the goals we set for the integration are being successfully met as we have 

 

  

we recognized goodwill and other intangible assets on the hrh acquisition of approximately 16 billion and 06 billion respectively 

 

gras savoye 

 

in december 2009 we completed a leveraged transaction with the original family shareholders of gras savoye and astorg partners a private equity fund to reorganize the capital of gras savoye as a result of this transaction 

 

 

  

we believe that the revised structure enhances our financial flexibility while at the same time retaining gras savoye as a key strategic partner 

 

as a consequence of the reduction in our ownership interest we expect earnings from our associates to be approximately 10 million lower in 2010 compared with 2009 

 

2008 expense review shaping our future and right sizing willis 

 

our shaping our future strategy is a series of initiatives designed to deliver profitable growth as part of this we have invested in key hires and initiatives in 2008 and 2009 and we have funded these initiatives from a thorough review in 2008 of all businesses to identify additional opportunities to rationalize our expense base 

 

additionally in the latter part of 2008 and in light of the global economic uncertainty we launched right sizing willis to reinforce our cost saving initiatives right sizing willis initiatives include talent management to either improve or manage out poor performers location optimization and aggressive reduction of discretionary spending 

 

in 2009 we incurred pretax severance costs of 24 million relating to approximately 450 positions which have been eliminated 17 million net of tax equivalent to 011 per diluted share in connection with our right sizing willis initiatives 

 

in 2008 we incurred a pretax charge of 92 million 66 million net of tax equivalent to 045 per diluted share comprising 

 

 

  

in light of the current global economic uncertainty we continue to vigorously manage our cost base in order to fund further growth initiatives our current funding for growth initiatives emphasize cost discipline including talent management location optimization and robust management of discretionary spending 

 

in 2009 we realized approximately 100 million of gross benefits from previous initiatives including 

 

  

cash and financing 

 

cash at december 31 2009 was 191 million 15 million higher than at december 31 2008 

 

in march 2009 we issued 12875 senior notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of 500 million to goldman sachs mezzanine partners which generated net proceeds of 482 million these proceeds together with 208 million of cash generated from operating activities and cash in hand were used to pay down the 750 million outstanding on our interim credit facility as of december 31 2008 

 

in september 2009 we issued 300 million of 7 senior notes due 2019 we then launched a tender offer on september 22 2009 to repurchase any and all of our 250 million 5125 senior notes 

due july 2010 at a premium of 2750 per 1000 face value notes totaling 160 million were tendered and repurchased on september 29 2009 

 

total debt total equity and the capitalization ratio at december 31 2009 were as follows 

 

 

 

liquidity 

 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations cash and cash equivalents of 191 million at december 31 2009 and 300 million remaining availability under our revolving credit facility 

 

based on current market conditions and information available to us at this time we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months 

 

share buybacks 

 

the board has authorized a share buyback program for 1 billion of which 925 million remains available 

 

in 2008 we repurchased 23 million shares at a cost of 75 million we did not make any repurchases in 2009 

 

we currently target a debt to adjusted ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ratio of below 25 times once we are in a position to remain at or below this ratio we would consider recommencing our stock buy back program at december 31 2009 the actual ratio was 26 times however there can be no assurance that we will achieve our target debt to ebitda ratio or recommence our stock buyback program 

 

operating results — group 

 

revenues 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

revenues for 2009 at 3263 million were 436 million or 15 percent higher than in 2008 reflecting a 19 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals principally attributable to hrh and organic growth in commissions and fees of 2 percent offset by a 4 percent adverse year over year impact from foreign currency translation and lower investment income 

 

our international and global operations earn a significant portion of their revenues in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2009 reported revenues were adversely impacted by the year over year effect of foreign currency translation in particular due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the pound sterling and against the euro compared with 2008 

 

investment income was 50 million for 2009 31 million lower than 2008 with the decrease reflecting significantly lower average interest rates 

in 2009 the impact of rate decreases on our investment income was partially mitigated by our forward hedging program in 2009 this generated additional income of 27 million compared with libor based rates we expect to see a lower benefit from our forward hedging program in 2010 

 

organic growth in commissions and fees was 2 percent for 2009 despite a negative 3 percent impact from declining premium rates and other market factors overall organic growth comprises good growth in our global operations and many of our international operations partly offset by declines in our north america uk and irish retail operations reflecting the weak economic environments and continuing soft market conditions in these territories organic revenue growth by segment is discussed further in ‘operating results — segment information’ below 

 

 

2008 compared with 2007 

 

 

 

 

  

our 2008 total revenues at 2827 million were 249 million or 10 percent higher than in 2007 reflecting a 7 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals principally attributable to hrh organic commissions and fee growth of 4 percent and a 1 percent benefit from foreign currency translation partly offset by lower investment and other income 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 reported revenues in international benefited from the year over year weakening of the us dollar against the euro compared with 2007 however in our global operations the revenue line benefit of the stronger euro was offset by sterling weakening against the us dollar compared with 2007 

 

investment income was 81 million for 2008 15 million lower than in 2007 with the decrease reflecting lower average interest rates in 2008 

other income was 2 million for 2008 17 million lower than in 2007 which benefited from a higher than usual level of proceeds from the sale of books of business 

 

organic growth in commissions and fees in 2008 was 4 percent compared with 2007 reflecting 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

 

general and administrative expenses 

 

 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

general and administrative expenses at 2422 million for 2009 were 181 million or 8 percent higher than 2008 the increase was mainly attributable to 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

 

salaries and benefits 

 

salaries and benefits were 56 percent of revenues for 2009 compared with 58 percent in 2008 reflecting the benefits of 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

effective may 15 2009 we closed our us defined benefit pension plan to future accrual and recognized a curtailment gain of 12 million in second quarter 2009 as a result the full year 2009 charge for the us plan was 7 million compared with an expected 39 million charge had the plan not been closed to future accrual 

 

we have also suspended the company match for our us 401k plan which benefited 2009 by 9 million compared with 2008 

 

uk salary sacrifice scheme 

 

with effect from april 2009 the company offered uk employees an alternative basis on which to fund contributions into the uk pension plans uk employees can now agree to sacrifice an amount of their salary and in return the company makes additional pension contributions on their behalf equivalent to the value of the salary sacrificed 

from a payroll tax perspective this is a more efficient method of making pension contributions 

 

as a result of this change the company made additional pension contributions of 8 million with a marginally higher saving in salaries and payroll taxes 

 

other expenses 

 

other expenses were 18 percent of revenues for 2009 compared with 21 percent in 2008 reflecting the benefit of 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

2008 compared with 2007 

 

general and administrative expenses at 2241 million for 2008 were 333 million or 18 percent higher than in 2007 of which 

 

  

salaries and benefits 

 

salaries and benefits were 58 percent of 2008 revenues compared with 56 percent in 2007 with the increase reflecting 

 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

other expenses 

 

other expenses were 21 percent of revenues in 2008 compared with 18 percent in 2007 with the increase reflecting 

 

  

we have a program that hedges our sterling cash outflows from our london market operations a part of which hedges the sterling denominated cash contributions into the uk pension plan however we do not hedge against the pension benefits asset or liability recognized for accounting purposes 

 

the effects of the above increases were partly mitigated by the benefits of our continued focus on cost controls 

 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

amortization of intangible assets of 100 million in 2009 was 64 million higher than in 2008 

 

the significant year over year increase was primarily attributable to additional charges of 58 million in 2009 in respect of intangible assets recognized on the hrh acquisition including 7 million of accelerated amortization relating to the hrh brand name following the success of our integration of hrh into our previously existing north america operations we announced on october 1 2009 that we were changing the name of 

our north america operations from willis hrh to willis north america consequently the intangible asset recognized on the acquisition of hrh relating to the hrh brand name has been fully amortized 

 

amortization of intangible assets of 36 million in 2008 was 22 million higher than in 2007 with the increase primarily attributable to a 21 million charge in fourth quarter 2008 in respect of intangible assets recognized on the hrh acquisition 

 

 

operating income and margin operating income as a percentage of revenues 

 

 

 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

operating margin was 21 percent for 2009 compared with 18 percent for 2008 this increase reflected the impact of 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

 

2008 compared with 2007 

 

operating margin was 18 percent in 2008 compared with 24 percent in 2007 this decrease reflected the impact of 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

 

interest expense 

 

 

 

interest expense in 2009 of 174 million was 69 million higher than in 2008 this increase primarily reflects higher average debt levels following the hrh acquisition but also includes 5 million of premium and costs relating to the early repurchase in september 2009 of 160 million of our 5125 senior notes due july 2010 at a premium of 2750 per 1000 face value 

 

we are currently reviewing opportunities to reduce future interest costs in the shortterm through a fixed  floating interest rate swap 

interest expense in 2008 of 105 million was 39 million higher than in 2007 this increase primarily reflects higher average debt levels and in particular 18 million additional interest expense relating to the term loan and interim credit facilities connected with the hrh acquisition a 9 million charge for amortization of debt fees associated with these facilities and a 9 million additional interest expense in 2008 due to fixed term 600 million senior notes issued in march 2007 

 

 

income taxes 

 

 

 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

the effective tax rate in 2009 was 18 percent compared with 24 percent in 2008 the decrease in rate reflects 

 

  

excluding the benefit of these tax credits the effective tax rate for 2009 would be 26 percent 

2008 compared with 2007 

 

the effective tax rate in 2008 was 24 percent compared with 26 percent in 2007 with the decrease in rate reflecting 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

 

 

interest in earnings of associates 

 

interest in earnings of associates net of tax was 33 million in 2009 11 million higher than in 2008 these increases reflect improved performance and an increased ownership share in gras savoye our largest associate for most of the year as described within the ‘executive summary’ section above our interest in gras savoye reduced from 

49 percent to 31 percent following the reorganization of that company’s capital in december 2009 as a result of this transaction we currently estimate that the interest in earnings of associates will be approximately 10 million lower in 2010 compared with 2009 

 

 

net income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

 

 

 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

net income from continuing operations for 2009 was 436 million compared with 302 million in 2008 the 134 million increase primarily reflected the 191 million increase in operating income discussed above partly offset by the 69 million increase in interest expense 

 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2009 increased to 258 compared to 204 in 2008 as the benefit of the increased net income was partly offset by a 21 million increase in average diluted shares outstanding due primarily to the shares issued on october 1 2008 for the hrh acquisition the additional shares issued had a negative 036 impact on earnings per diluted share in 2009 

 

foreign currency translation had a year over year 027 positive impact on earnings per diluted share in 2009 

2008 compared with 2007 

 

net income for 2008 was 302 million or 204 per diluted share compared to 409 million or 278 per diluted share in 2007 with the decrease mainly reflecting the impact of

operating results — segment information 

 

 

we organize our business into three segments global north america and international our global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for risks 

arising from specific industries and activities north america and international comprise our retail operations and provide services to small medium and major corporations 

 

 

the following table is a summary of our operating results by segment for the three years ended december 31 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

global 

 

our global operations comprise global specialties reinsurance and faber  dumas our wholesale brokerage division launched in fourth quarter 2008 on completion of the hrh acquisition faber  dumas comprises hrh’s londonbased wholesale operation glencairn together with our previously 

existing fine art jewelry and specie special contingency risk and hughesgibb units the following table sets out revenues organic revenue growth and operating income and margin for the three years ended december 31 2009

revenues 2009 compared with 2008 

 

commissions and fees of 822 million were 38 million or 5 percent higher in 2009 compared with 2008 of which 4 percent was attributable to the acquisition of the hrh uk wholesale business glencairn and 4 percent to organic revenue growth these were partly offset by a 3 percent negative impact from foreign exchange movements 

 

net new business growth was 5 percent and there was a 1 percent adverse impact from rates and other market factors reinsurance led the growth in net new business global specialties organic revenues were slightly higher than in 2008 as growth in marine aerospace and financial and executive risks was offset by reductions elsewhere there was continued softness in most specialty rates although there were signs of stabilization and firming in some areas including aerospace and energy the faber  dumas businesses continue to be adversely impacted by the weakening economic environment 

 

there was a sharp decline in investment income in 2009 compared with 2008 as global interest rates fell markedly in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 

 

productivity continued to improve with a 3 percent rise in revenues per fte employee to 358000 in 2009 compared with 2008 client retention remained steady at 90 percent for the full year 2009 

 

revenues 2008 compared with 2007 

 

commissions and fees were 34 million or 5 percent higher in 2008 compared with 2007 of which 3 percent was attributable to the net impact of acquisitions and disposals mainly due to hrh’s ukbased specialty business there was no net impact from foreign currency translation as a benefit from the euro strengthening year over year against the dollar was offset by a negative impact from sterling weakening against the dollar 

organic revenue growth was 2 percent as the benefit of good growth in global specialties was partly offset by lower commissions and fees in reinsurance 

 

global specialties organic revenue growth reflected the benefit of good growth in marine financial institutions bloodstock jewelry specie and global markets and was achieved despite significant rate reductions 

 

organic revenue growth in reinsurance in 2008 was adversely impacted by a combination of declining rates and a reduction in amounts reinsured we continue to make investments in reinsurance to strengthen capital markets and analytics capabilities throughout the soft market and are beginning to see the positive results of this investment as we moved into 2009 

 

client retention levels in global improved to approximately 90 percent in 2008 compared with approximately 89 percent in 2007 

 

operating margin 2009 compared with 2008 

 

operating margin was 31 percent in 2009 compared with 29 percent in 2008 this improvement reflected a significant benefit from foreign currency translation together with organic revenue growth particularly driven by our reinsurance business and good cost controls including a reduction in discretionary expenses the benefit of these was partly offset by a significant increase in the uk pension expense and the sharp reduction in investment income 

 

despite an overall reduction in headcount since december 31 2008 we continue to recruit selectively for our global businesses in first quarter 2009 we recruited a reinsurance team from carvill this team provides specialty casualty and professional liability experience we have also recruited specialty expertise in marine aerospace and faber  dumas 

operating margin 2008 compared with 2007 

 

operating margin in our global operations was 29 percent in 2008 compared with 28 percent in 2007 as the benefit of organic revenue growth in global specialties was partly offset by the impact of lower revenues in reinsurance and an adverse impact from foreign exchange 

 

operating margin in global specialties increased in 2008 compared with 2007 as the benefit from organic revenue growth lower pension costs and our shaping our future initiatives more than offset 

further spend on targeted hires and strategic initiatives 

 

operating margin in reinsurance in 2008 was broadly in line with 2007 as the impact of lower commissions and fees was largely offset by the benefits of shaping our future initiatives lower pension costs and the positive results of our continued investments to strengthen capital markets and analytics capabilities throughout the soft market 

 

north america 

 

 

 

 

  

 

revenues 2009 compared with 2008 

 

commissions and fees in north america were 51 percent higher in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting the uplift from the additional revenues of hrh partly offset by 3 percent negative organic growth our north america operations were significantly adversely impacted by soft market conditions the weakened us economy and a reduction in project based revenues which more than offset a positive impact from net new business in particular our construction division has seen significant declines however we saw the rate of decline moderate in the third quarter of 2009 and north america reported 1 percent organic growth 

for the fourth quarter of 2009 despite a 6 percent rate headwind 

 

our primary focus in north america in 2009 was the integration of hrh into our existing operations and the improvement of margin additionally in the second half of the year we refocused our efforts on revenue growth and we believe this has led to over 10 percent new business generation in parts of the business during that time period 

 

despite the difficult market conditions our productivity measured in terms of revenue per fte employee remained high and with a marginal increase to 226000 for 2009 compared with 225000 for 2008 

revenues 2008 compared with 2007 

 

commissions and fees in north america were 154 million or 21 percent higher in 2008 compared with 2007 of which 174 million was attributable to hrh’s fourth quarter 2008 revenues excluding hrh organic commissions and fees declined by 1 percent reflecting the soft market conditions 

 

chicago atlanta houston boston and knoxville all generated growth in excess of 5 percent though several offices recorded significant declines in the difficult market conditions 

 

the integration of the hrh acquisition made good progress in fourth quarter 2008 with only 2 percent attrition of legacy hrh producers since the announcement of the hrh acquisition in june 2008 

 

client retention levels improved to approximately 91 percent in 2008 an increase of approximately 3 percentage points from 2007 and productivity continued to improve with an approximately 2 percent rise in revenues per fte employee in 2008 compared with 2007 

 

operating margin 2009 compared with 2008 

 

operating margin in north america was 24 percent in 2009 compared with 15 percent in 2008 the higher margin reflected 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

 

hrh integration 

 

the integration of hrh into our existing operations is now substantially complete and reflecting this success we changed the name of our north america retail operations from willis hrh to willis north america on october 1 2009 progress to date includes 

 

  

operating margin 2008 compared with 2007 

 

operating margin in north america in 2008 was 15 percent compared with 19 percent in 2007 the decrease of 4 percentage points reflected 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

international 

 

 

 

 

  

revenues 2009 compared with 2008 

 

commissions and fees in international were 35 million or 3 percent lower in 2009 compared with 2008 as double digit new business generation in many of our international units was more than offset by an adverse impact from foreign exchange of 8 percent a 3 percent adverse impact from rates and other market factors and significantly lower revenues in our uk and irish retail operations 

 

a significant part of international’s revenues are earned in currencies other than the us dollar which has strengthened significantly on average on a year over year basis against a number of these currencies most notably the euro pound sterling danish kroner and australian dollar consequently reducing international revenues on a year over year basis when reported in us dollars 

 

despite the slowdown of the global economy international continued its organic growth excluding our uk and irish retail divisions organic revenue growth was 8 percent in 2009 with latin america and asia led by brazil columbia and china all reporting strong organic growth however our uk and irish retail division which 

represents approximately 20 percent of international’s operations saw a 6 percent revenue decline reflecting weak local economic conditions 

 

productivity in international continues to improve with revenues per fte employee increasing by 4 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 

 

client retention levels remained high at approximately 90 percent for 2009 

 

revenues 2008 compared with 2007 

 

commissions and fees in international were 93 million or 10 percent higher in 2008 compared with 2007 

 

foreign currency translation benefited 2008 revenues by 1 percent compared with 2007 

 

organic revenue growth of 9 percent in 2008 was achieved despite declining rates in most countries 

 

we have seen consistent growth in our international business over the last three years with all twelve quarters in this period showing growth of 5 percent or higher with spain denmark and latin america continuing to contribute significantly 

productivity in international continued to improve with revenues per fte employee rising by 6 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 and average client retention levels remaining high at approximately 91 percent 

 

operating margin 2009 compared with 2008 

 

operating margin in international was 26 percent in 2009 compared with 28 percent in 2008 the benefits of 

 

  

were more than offset by 

 

 

operating margin 2008 compared with 2007 

 

operating margin in international was 28 percent in 2008 compared with 25 percent in 2007 with the 3 percentage point improvement reflecting the strong organic revenue growth increased productivity and continued expense discipline partly offset by significant investment in targeted hires and the adverse impact of declining rates in most countries 

 

venezuela 

 

on january 8 2010 the venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue its currency bolivar effective january 1 2010 the venezuelan economy has been designated as hyperinflationary and consequently all future exchange movements will flow through the income statement 

 

our preliminary estimate of the impact of these changes on our 2010 income statement is that diluted earnings per share for the group may be approximately 003 lower than it would otherwise have been 

 

currently we do not anticipate any material impact on our balance sheet from the devaluation 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

 

our accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our audit committee 

 

pension expense 

 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the us and uk both these plans are now closed to new entrants and with effect from may 15 2009 we closed our us defined benefit plan to future accrual new entrants in the uk are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the united states are offered the opportunity to join a 401k plan we also have smaller defined benefit schemes in ireland germany norway and the netherlands these schemes have combined total assets of 120 million and a combined net liability for pension benefits of 30 million as of december 31 

2009 elsewhere pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans 

 

we make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate the discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination 

 

we recorded a net pension charge on our uk and us defined benefit pension plans in 2009 of 32 million compared to a net pension credit of 25 million in 2008 an increased expense of 57 million 

the uk plan charge was 63 million higher reflecting 

 

 

partly offset by 

 

  

the us pension charge was 6 million lower in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting the closure of the scheme and the resulting 12 million curtailment gain 

 

based on december 31 2009 assumptions we expect the net pension charge in 2010 to increase by 2 million for the uk plan and decrease by 6 million for the us plan 

 

uk plan 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

during the latter half of 2008 the value of assets held by our pension plans was significantly adversely affected by the turmoil in worldwide markets the holdings of equity securities by our uk and us pension plans were particularly affected in 2008 but have recovered to some extent in 2009 

 

rates used to discount pension plan liabilities at december 31 2009 were based on yields prevailing at that date of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity the selected rate used to discount uk plan liabilities was 58 percent compared with 65 percent at december 31 2008 

with the decrease reflecting a reduction in uk longterm bond rates in the second half of 2009 the lower discount rate and reduced inflation assumption generated an actuarial gain of 208 million at december 31 2009 

 

mortality assumptions at december 31 2009 were unchanged from december 31 2008 the mortality assumption is the 100 percent pna00 table without an age adjustment as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a uk male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2009 would have a life expectancy of 22 years 

 

us plan 

 

 

 

 

  

the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net us pension scheme expense in 2009 was 80 percent consistent with 2008 the rate used to discount us plan liabilities at december 31 2009 was 61 percent determined based on expected plan cash flows discounted using 

a corporate bond yield curve a small reduction from 63 percent at december 31 2008 the expected and actual returns on us plan assets for the three years ended december 31 2009 were as follows 

 

 

 

 

the mortality assumption at december 31 2009 is the rp2000 mortality table blended for annuitants and nonannuitants projected to 2010 by scale aa december 31 2008 projected to 2009 by scale 

aa as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a us male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2009 would have a life expectancy of 18 years 

 

 

 

intangible assets 

 

intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of businesses acquired we classify our intangible assets into three categories 

 

  

client relationships acquired on the hrh acquisition are amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected to be consumed over 80 percent of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized after 10 years noncompete agreements acquired in connection with the hrh acquisition are amortized 

over two years on a straight line basis intangible assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis goodwill is not subject to amortization 

 

to determine the allocation of intangible assets between goodwill and other intangible assets and the estimated useful lives in respect of the hrh acquisition we considered a report produced by a qualified independent appraiser the calculation of the allocation is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions we base our allocation on assumptions we believe to be reasonable however changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

impairment review 

 

we review all our intangible assets for impairment periodically at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have 

occurred application of the impairment test requires judgment including 

 

  

the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and in aggregate validated against our market capitalization this analysis requires significant judgments including 

 

  

we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable however changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed during the fourth quarter of 2009 did not result in an impairment charge 2008 nil 2007 nil 

 

income taxes 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards we estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies 

 

at december 31 2009 we had gross deferred tax assets of 390 million 2008 362 million against which a valuation allowance of 92 million 2008 

85 million had been recognized to the extent that 

 

  

we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income 

 

positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities the benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts the company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions in 2009 11 million was released relating to uncertain tax positions due to the closure of the statute of limitations on assessments for previously unrecognized tax benefits there was a similar 5 million release of uncertain tax positions in 2008 

 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

 

we purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly over recent years we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but 

not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case 

reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice 

 

new accounting standards 

 

 

new accounting standards issued during the year that would have a significant impact on the 

company’s reporting are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

during 2009 we have taken a number of actions to significantly improve our debt maturity profile 

 

  

since december 31 2009 we have 

 

  

once the remaining 83 million of senior notes due july 2010 are repaid the only mandatory repayments over the next 5 years are the scheduled repayments on our 700 million 5year term loan and 4 million due on a fixed rate loan note due 2012 

 

in the short term our capital management priority is debt reduction and we are currently targeting a debt to adjusted ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ratio of below 25 times once we are in a position to remain at or below this ratio we would consider recommencing our stock buyback program at december 31 2009 the actual ratio was 26 times however there can be no assurance that we will achieve our target debt 

to ebitda ratio or recommence our stock buyback program 

 

liquidity 

 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations cash and cash equivalents of 191 million at december 31 2009 and remaining availability of 300 million under our revolving credit facility 

 

as of december 31 2009 our shortterm liquidity requirements consisted of 

 

  

our longterm liquidity requirements consist of 

 

  

based on current market conditions and information available to us at this time we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months 

 

in an effort to reduce future cash interest payments as well as future amounts due at maturity we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through tender offers cash purchases in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such actions if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

 

in september 2009 standard and poor’s and moody’s revised their outlook on the company to stable from negative we believe that the improved 

outlook and our current ratings allow us more flexibility in our capital planning 

 

we continue to identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance including cash flow these actions include the rationalization of our cost base through our ongoing right sizing willis initiatives to achieve the best structure within the current environment 

 

fiduciary funds 

 

as an intermediary we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers we report premiums which are held on account of or due from clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers claims held by or due to us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities all of these balances due or payable are included in accounts receivable and accounts payable on the balance sheet we earn interest on these funds during the time between the receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid out fiduciary cash must be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which generally emphasize capital preservation and liquidity and is not generally available to service our debt or for other corporate purposes 

 

operating activities 

 

2009 compared to 2008 

 

net cash provided by operations was 418 million in 2009 compared with 224 million in 2008 the 194 million increase between 2008 and 2009 mainly reflects 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

 

net cash from operations in 2008 was 51 million lower than in 2007 mainly reflecting 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

investing activities 

 

2009 compared to 2008 

 

total net cash inflow from investing activities was 102 million in 2009 compared with an outflow of 1033 million in 2008 reflecting 

 

  

2008 compared to 2007 

 

total net cash used in investing activities was 1033 million in 2008 compared with 181 million in 2007 the movement was attributable to 

 

 

  

partly offset by 

 

  

financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 516 million in 2009 compared with an inflow of 808 million in 2008 and an outflow of 193 million in 2007 

 

longterm debt 

 

in march 2009 we issued 500 million of senior notes due 2016 at 12875 

 

we used the 482 million net proceeds of the notes together with 208 million cash generated from operating activities and 60 million cash in hand to pay down the 750 million outstanding on our interim credit facility as of december 31 2008 

 

in september 2009 we issued 300 million of 70 senior notes due 2019 we then launched a tender offer on september 22 2009 to repurchase any and all of our 250 million 5125 senior notes due july 2010 at a premium of 2750 per 1000 face value notes totaling 160 million were tendered and repurchased on september 29 2009 

 

in december 2009 we applied the net cash proceeds of 155 million from the gras savoye transaction together with other cash in hand to reduce the balance outstanding on the 5year term loan by approximately 180 million to 

521 million of which 27 million related to our first mandatory debt repayment 

 

as of december 31 2009 there were no amounts outstanding under our 300 million revolving credit facility 2008 nil 2007 50 million 

 

share buybacks 

 

we did not buyback any shares in 2009 there remains 925 million under the current buyback authorization 

 

in 2008 we repurchased 23 million shares at a cost of 75 million and in 2007 we repurchased 115 million shares for 480 million of cash 

 

in 2009 the company filed a tender offer statement with the sec to repurchase for cash options to purchase company shares the tender offer expired on august 6 2009 approximately 16 million options to purchase company shares were repurchased at an average per share price of 204 

 

dividends 

 

cash dividends paid in 2009 were 174 million compared with 146 million in 2008 and 143 million in 2007 

 

the 28 million increase primarily reflects dividend payments on the 24 million additional shares issued in connection with the fourth quarter 2008 acquisition of hrh in february 2010 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 026 per share an annual rate of 104 per share subject to the irish high court approving a reduction of our share capital in order to create distributable reserves which under irish law are required to facilitate the payment of a dividend and compliance generally with the requirements of the irish companies act relating to the payment of dividends 

 

contractual obligations 

 

our contractual obligations at december 31 2009 were 

 

 

 

 

  

debt facilities 

 

in march 2009 we issued 12875 senior notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of 500 million to goldman sachs mezzanine partners which generated net proceeds of 482 million these proceeds together with 208 million cash generated from operating activities and cash in hand were used to pay down the 750 million outstanding on our interim credit facility as of december 31 2008 

 

in september 2009 we issued 300 million of 70 senior notes due 2019 we then launched a tender offer on september 22 2009 to repurchase any and all of our 250 million 5125 senior notes due july 2010 at a premium of 2750 per 1000 face value notes totaling approximately 160 million were tendered and repurchased on september 29 2009 

 

in december 2009 we applied the net cash proceeds of 155 million from the gras savoye transaction together with other cash in hand to reduce the balance outstanding on the 5year term loan by approximately 180 million to 521 million 

since the end of the year we have 

 

  

once the remaining 83 million of july 2010 bonds are repaid the only mandatory repayments over the next 5 years are the scheduled repayments on our 700 million 5year term loan and 4 million due on a fixed rate loan note due 2012 

 

operating leases 

 

we lease our london headquarters building under a 25 year operating lease which expires in 2032 annual rentals are 31 million per year and we have subleased approximately 30 percent of the premises under leases up to 15 years the outstanding contractual obligation for lease rentals at december 31 2009 was 785 million and the amounts receivable from subleases was 100 million 

pensions 

 

contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the contributions we expect to make over the next five years into our us and uk plans these contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the two plans 

 

in the uk we are required to agree a funding strategy for our uk defined benefit plan with the plan’s trustees in february 2009 we agreed to make full year contributions to the uk plan of 40 million for 2009 through 2012 excluding amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme in addition as certain funding targets have not been met at the beginning of 2010 a further contribution 

of 40 million is required for 2010 a similar additional contribution may also be required for 2011 depending on actual performance against funding targets at the beginning of 2011 

 

for the us plan expected contributions are the contributions we will be required to make under us pension legislation based on our december 31 2009 balance sheet position we currently expect to contribute 30 million in 2010 and 30 million per year from 2011 to 2014 

 

the total contributions for all plans are currently estimated to be approximately 120 million in 2010 excluding amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme 

 

offbalance sheet transactions 

 

 

apart from commitments guarantees and contingencies as disclosed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements the company has no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or 

are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives we do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes 

 

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 — basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements and further disclosure is provided in note 22 — financial instruments of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

foreign exchange risk management 

 

because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results 

 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars outside the united states we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our london market operations which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling 

 

the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2009 

 

 

 

our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from 

 

  

london market operations 

 

in our london market operations we earn revenue in a number of different currencies principally us dollars pounds sterling euros and japanese yen but incur expenses almost entirely in pounds sterling 

we hedge this risk as follows 

 

  

generally it is our policy to hedge at least 25 percent of the next 12 months’ exposure in significant currencies we do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

 

in addition we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any net sterling asset or liability position in our london market operations where this risk relates to shortterm cash flows we hedge all or part of the risk by forward purchases or sales 

 

however where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit we do not hedge the risk consequently if our london market operations have a significant pension asset or liability we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the us dollar and pounds sterling exchange rate changes we do however hedge the pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan 

 

translation risk 

 

outside our us and london market operations we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency when we translate the results and net assets of these operations into us dollars for reporting purposes movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets for example if the us dollar strengthens against the euro the reported results of our eurozone operations in us dollar terms will be lower we do not hedge translation risk 

 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table 

summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates all 

forward exchange contracts mature within four years 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the uk is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities the company does not hedge net income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the uk 

 

interest rate risk management 

 

our operations are financed principally by 1840 million fixed rate senior notes issued by subsidiaries and 521 million under a 5year term loan facility of the fixed rate senior notes 90 million are due 2010 350 million are due 2015 500 million are due 2016 600 million are due 2017 and 300 million are due 2019 the 5year term loan facility amortizes at the rate of 27 million per quarter as of december 31 2009 we had access to but had not drawn 300 million under a 5year revolving credit facility the interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown 

we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in both us dollars and pounds sterling 

 

as a consequence of our insurance and reinsurance broking activities there is a delay between the time we receive cash for premiums and claims and the time the cash needs to be paid we earn interest on this float which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income 

 

this float is regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which it may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity we manage the interest rate risk arising from this exposure primarily through the use of interest rate swaps it is our policy that for currencies with significant balances a minimum of 25 percent of forecast income arising is hedged for each of the next three years 

 

the table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial 

instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest for interest rate swaps the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts the duration of interest rate swaps varies 

between one and four years with refixing periods of three months average fixed and variable rates are respectively the weightedaverage actual and market rates for the interest hedges in place market rates are the rates prevailing at december 31 2009 or 2008 as appropriate

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

to the board of directors and stockholders of willis group holdings public limited company 

dublin ireland 

 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of willis group holdings public limited company and subsidiaries the ‘company’ as of december 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2009 of the company and our report dated february 26 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the adoption of the noncontrolling interest guidance from accounting standards codification 810 consolidations formerly statement of financial accounting standards no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb 51

through 2006 our international unit consisted of our network of subsidiaries and associates other than those in north america the united kingdom and republic of ireland the operation was located in 71 countries worldwide including 22 countries in europe 12 in the asiapacific region and 37 elsewhere in the world the services provided were focused according to the characteristics of each market and were not identical in every office but generally included direct risk management and insurance brokerage specialist and reinsurance brokerage and employee benefits consulting 

our global markets international unit based in the uk works closely with the international networks to further develop access to global markets and provide structuring and placing skills in the relevant areas of property and casualty liability 

we believe the combined total revenues of our international subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread and capability of our international network in 2006 combined total revenues of our international subsidiaries and our associates were 1009 million compared to 935 million in 2005 our consolidated total revenues for 2006 only include the revenues of our international subsidiaries of 569 million and do not include the revenues of our associates of 440 million 

in 2006 we acquired link forsikringsmegling as a norwegian insurance broker nicon försäkringsmäklarna ab a swedish insurance broker and increased our interest in france’s leading insurance broker gras savoye  cie from 33 to 38 

the following is a list of the major international associate investments currently held by us and our interest as of december 31 2006 

 

  

in connection with many of our investments we retain rights to increase our ownership percentage over time typically to a majority or 100 ownership position in addition in certain instances our coshareholders have a right typically based on some price formula of revenues or earnings to put some or all of their shares to us see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in addition to our strategic investments in associates we have acquired a controlling interest in a broad geographic spread of other brokers the following is a list of the significant international subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest and our interest as of december 31 2006 

 

  

customers 

our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational corporations to middlemarket companies further many of our client relationships span decades for instance our relationship with the tokio marine and fire insurance company limited dates back over 100 years no one client accounted for more than 10 of revenues for fiscal year 2006 additionally we place insurance with over 5000 insurance carriers none of which individually accounted for more than 10 of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2006 

competition 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price according to the directory of agents and brokers published by business insurance in july 2006 the 130 largest commercial insurance brokers globally reported brokerage revenues totaling 32 billion in 2005 of which marsh  mclennan companies inc had approximately 31 and aon corporation had approximately 20 

we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms although marsh  mclennan and aon along with us have agreed to implement certain business reforms many specialist regional and local firms have not agreed to those business reforms these firms are continuing to accept contingent compensation and are not disclosing the compensation received in connection with providing policy placement services to the customer if we are unable to compete effectively against those competitors we may lose market share insurance companies also compete with brokers by directly soliciting insureds without the assistance of an independent broker or agent competition for business is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example insurers are currently retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies are increasingly relying upon captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buying insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

regulation 

our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasigovernmental regulatory supervision in virtually all countries in which we operate while these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria 

the european union insurance mediation directive introduced rules for implementation by january 2005 to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the eu on a basis consistent with the eu single market and customer protection aims each eu member state is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence good repute professional indemnity cover and financial capacity in the united kingdom the statutory body is the financial services authority 

the financial services authority has prescribed the methods by which our insurance and reinsurance operations are to conduct business and they generally conduct their regulatory functions through the establishment of net worth and other financial criteria they also require the submission of reports and have investigative and disciplinary powers monitoring visits are carried out to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements 

further our clients have the right to file complaints with our regulators about our services and the regulators may conduct an investigation or require us to conduct an investigation into these complaints our failure or that of our employees to satisfy the regulators that we are in compliance with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities can result in disciplinary action fines reputational damage and financial harm 

our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the united states are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction insurance laws in the united states are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions 

all companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the united kingdom and united states we do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 13000 employees worldwide of whom approximately 3600 were employed in the united kingdom and 3750 in the united states with the balance being employed across the rest of the world in addition our associates had approximately 3000 employees all of whom were located outside the united kingdom and the united states 




 item 1a—risk factors 

risks relating to our business and the insurance industry 

this section describes the material risks affecting the group’s business these risks could materially affect the group’s business its revenues operating income net income net assets and liquidity and capital resources and accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k 

premiums and commissions—we do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services we do not determine insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions from the late 1980s through late 2000 insurance premium rates generally declined as a result of a number of factors including the expanded underwriting capacity of insurance carriers consolidation of both insurance intermediaries and insurance carriers and increased competition among insurance carriers during 2004 we saw a rapid transition from a “hard” market with premium rates stable or increasing to a “soft” market with premium rates falling in most markets these rate declines were most pronounced in the property and casualty market with rates 

falling between 10 and 30 by year end rates have continued to decline in most sectors through 2005 and 2006 with the exception of catastropheexposed markets 

in addition as traditional riskbearing insurance carriers continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated agents or brokers such as ourselves those insurance carriers may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

regulation—we are subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements we may not be able to conduct our business 

many of our activities are subject to regulatory supervision in virtually all the countries in which we are based or our activities are undertaken failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary action including requiring clients to be compensated for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in addition changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational improvements or modifications at various locations which could result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business 

regulation—we are subject to a number of investigations and legal proceedings concerning contingent compensation other industry practices and certain conduct which if determined unfavorably to us could adversely affect our financial results 

we have been subject to investigations by the departments of insurance or attorneys general of over 20 states canada and australia concerning among other things arrangements pursuant to which insurers compensated insurance brokers for distribution and other services provided to insurers known as contingent compensation bid rigging tying and other possible violations of law including violations of fiduciary duty securities laws and antitrust laws 

in april 2005 we resolved the new york investigation by entering into an assurance of discontinuance or ny aod with the new york attorney general and the new york superintendent of insurance pursuant to which we have paid 50 million to eligible customers we also agreed to continue and further implement certain business reforms these reforms include an agreement not to accept contingent compensation and an undertaking to disclose to customers any compensation we will receive in connection with providing policy placement services to the customer we also resolved a similar investigation by the minnesota attorney general by entering into an assurance of discontinuance pursuant to which we paid 1 million to minnesota customers and implemented the business reforms described in the ny aod while we are fully cooperating with the other investigations including subpoenas and requests for information we cannot predict at this time how or when those investigations will be resolved 

since august 2004 various plaintiffs have filed purported class actions in new york illinois california new jersey and florida under a variety of legal theories including state tort contract fiduciary duty and statutory theories and federal antitrust and rico theories other than a federal suit in illinois that was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff in may 2005 all of the federal actions have been consolidated into two actions in federal court in new jersey one of the consolidated actions addresses employee benefits insurance while the other consolidated action addresses all other lines of insurance in addition to the two federal actions we were also named as a defendant in purported class actions in state courts in florida and massachusetts in june 2006 the plaintiff in the massachusetts state action voluntarily dismissed its complaint with prejudice both consolidated federal actions and the remaining state action name various insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms including us as defendants the allegations relate to the practices and conduct that has been the subject of the investigations described 

above including allegations that the brokers are breaching their duties to their clients by entering into contingent compensation agreements with insufficient disclosure to clients as well as allegations of bid rigging tying and the improper use of affiliated wholesalers the complaints also allege the existence of a conspiracy among the insurance carriers and brokers and the federal court complaints allege violations of the federal rico statute we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims the outcomes of these lawsuits however including any losses or other payments that may occur as a result cannot be predicted at this time 

the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters in addition even if we do not experience significant monetary costs there may be adverse publicity associated with these matters that will result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business 

claims lawsuits and other proceedings—our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist our clients with matters including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims involving substantial amounts of money errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include allegations of damages for our employees or subagents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis errors and omissions claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly over recent years in respect of selfinsured risks w e have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us have subject to our selfinsured deductibles been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

the principal actual or potential claims lawsuits and proceedings to which we are currently subject including but not limited to errors and omissions claims are 1 claims relating to services provided by one of our uk subsidiaries willis faber underwriting management limited to another subsidiary sovereign marine  general insurance company limited in scheme of arrangement “sovereign’’ that was engaged in insurance underwriting prior to 1991 as well as certain thirdparty insurance companies 2 claims with respect to our placement of property and casualty insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted by the september 11 2001 destruction of new york’s world trade 

center complex 3 the regulatory and other proceedings relating to contingent compensation arrangements referred to above 4 potential claims arising out of various legal proceedings between reinsurers reinsureds and their reinsurance brokers relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance placements for the years 1993 to 1998 and 5 potential damages arising out of a federal district court action commenced in 2001 on behalf of a class of approximately 200 present and former female officer and officer equivalent employees for alleged discrimination against them on the basis of their gender 

put and call arrangements—we have entered into significant put and call arrangements which may require us to pay substantial amounts to purchase shares in one of our associates those payments would reduce our liquidity and shortterm cash flow 

in connection with many of our investments in our associates we retain rights to increase our ownership percentages over time and in some cases the existing owners also have a right to put their shares to us the put arrangement in place for shares of our associate gras savoye may require us to pay substantial amounts to purchase those shares which could decrease our liquidity and shortterm cash flow 

the rights under the put arrangement may be exercised through 2011 if fully exercised we would be required to buy shares of gras savoye other than those held by its management possibly increasing our ownership interest from 38 to 90 management shareholders of gras savoye representing approximately 10 of the outstanding shares do not have general put rights before 2011 but have certain put rights on their death disability or retirement payments in connection with management put rights would not have exceeded 64 million if those rights had been fully exercised at december 31 2006 

from 2007 onwards the incremental 52 of gras savoye may be put to us at a price determined by a contractual formula based on earnings and revenue which at december 31 2006 would have amounted to approximately 337 million the shareholders may put their shares individually at any time during the put period and the amounts we may have to pay in connection with the put arrangements may significantly exceed this estimate 

competition—competition in our industry is intense and if we are unable to compete effectively we may lose market share and our business may be materially adversely affected 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two other providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms although marsh  mclennan and aon along with us have agreed to implement certain business reforms many specialist regional and local firms have not agreed to these business reforms these firms are continuing to accept contingent compensation and are not disclosing the compensation received in connection with providing policy placement services to the customer if we are unable to compete effectively against these competitors we will suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and loss of market share 

competition for business is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market and the other two providers of global risk management services have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies have been increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buying insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services 

dependence on key personnel—the loss of our chairman and chief executive officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives 

the loss of our chairman and chief executive officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our chairman and chief executive officer joseph j plumeri and a number of our senior management but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships the insurance and reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors in the past we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand train and manage our employee base we may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense 

international operations—our significant nonus operations particularly those in the united kingdom expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the united states accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in dollars in the united kingdom however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside the united states and the united kingdom we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency the table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2006 

 

  

because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses creates an exchange exposure as the pound sterling strengthens the us dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase which then causes our results to be negatively impacted given these facts the strength of the pounds sterling relative to the us dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results this risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations in the future 

generally our policy is to convert into pounds sterling all revenues arising in currencies other than us dollars together with sufficient us dollar revenues to fund the remaining pounds sterling expenses outside the united kingdom only those cash flows necessary to fund mismatches between revenues and expenses are converted into local currency amounts remitted to the united kingdom are usually converted into pounds sterling and the currency exposures managed by entering into forward exchange 

contracts generally it is our policy to hedge at least 25 of the next 12 months’ exposure in significant currencies we do not hedge exposures beyond three years 




 item 1b—unresolved staff comments 

the company had no unresolved comments from the sec’s staff that were issued more than 180 days prior to the december 31 2006 fiscal year end 




 item 2—properties 

we own and lease a number of properties for use as offices throughout the world and believe that our properties are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used the principal properties are located in the united kingdom and the united states our principal executive office at ten trinity square london is a landmark building which we sold in 2006 to developers we will lease back this facility until we move into our new uk headquarters in 2008 in november 2004 we entered into an agreement for lease with longtime client british land plc relating to our new uk headquarters in london construction commenced in april 2005 and willis occupancy is targeted for early 2008 




 item 3—legal proceedings 

general we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business similar to other corporations we are also subject to a variety of other claims including those relating to our employment practices some of those claims lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could if assessed be significant 

errors and omissions claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly over recent years in respect of selfinsured risks we have established provisions which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments on the basis of current information we do not expect that the actual claims lawsuits and other proceedings to which we are subject or potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating to matters of which we are aware will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity nonetheless given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions and the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could from time to time have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 

the most significant actual or potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings of which we are currently aware are 

sovereignwfum sovereign a wholly owned subsidiary of ours operated as an insurance company in the united kingdom and from 1972 sovereign’s underwriting activities were managed by another wholly owned subsidiary of ours willis faber underwriting management limited or wfum wfum also provided underwriting agency and other services to thirdparty insurance companies which we refer to as the stamp companies some of which are longstanding clients of ours as part of its services as agent wfum underwrote insurance and reinsurance business on behalf of sovereign and the stamp companies and arranged reinsurance on their behalf in 1991 sovereign and the stamp companies ceased underwriting new business sovereign entered provisional liquidation in 1997 

on january 5 2000 a scheme of arrangement proposed by sovereign to its creditors became effective the stated purpose of the scheme of arrangement is to resolve sovereign’s liabilities and provide that 

sovereign’s business is run off in as orderly a manner as possible the scheme administrators have announced payments to creditors at a payment percentage of 40 payable out of sovereign’s assets sovereign’s assets are separate and distinct from ours and any payment from sovereign will have no effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

sovereign and certain of the stamp companies have also expressed concern about the enforceability of certain reinsurance put in place by wfum on behalf of sovereign and the stamp companies accordingly we cannot assure you that there will be no arbitration judicial decisions or settlements arising in the future that result in shortfalls in reinsurance recoveries for sovereign or the stamp companies the failure of sovereign or the stamp companies to collect reinsurance following any adverse arbitration awards would increase the likelihood of them pursuing potential claims including shortfalls in reinsurance recoveries against wfum sovereign and the stamp companies have reserved their rights generally in respect of such potential claims and wfum willis group and certain of our brokerage subsidiaries have entered into standstill agreements which preserve the rights of potential claimants with respect to their potential claims 

all the stamp companies both sovereign and the solvent stamp companies have commenced the process of attempting to enter into final cutoff schemes of arrangements with their creditors for those stamp companies whose creditors approve the schemes in sufficient numbers the operation of the schemes will crystallise and bring to an end all remaining liabilities to insureds and reinsureds with creditors receiving payments in accordance with the scheme claim valuation process there is a scheme arrangement for each of the wfum stamp companies and each scheme is legally separate it is therefore possible that some schemes will proceed and some will not in contrast those stamp companies who are not able to agree a scheme arrangement with creditors may have to continue to run off liabilities for many years 

initial applications have been made to the english court and votes took place at creditors’ meetings on october 27 2006 the voting adjudication process valuing and verifying creditors’ votes will be completed during the first quarter of 2007 where sufficient voters by number and by value have approved the scheme proposals further applications will be made to the english and us courts for the schemes to be sanctioned these may be opposed by some creditors the courts are entitled to refuse to sanction schemes on the grounds of unfairness either generally or to certain classes of creditor these applications to the english and us courts are unlikely to be heard before the middle of 2007 

in 2004 the solvent stamp companies entered into a settlement agreement whereby willis group limited and all its subsidiaries received certain immediate releases and other releases staged in return for certain staged payments if any stamp company’s scheme arrangement fails to achieve the required vote the runoff may be lengthy there will be more opportunity for disputes to arise the final staged payment may not be accepted and claims may be made against us once the final staged payment is made willis and its subsidiaries will be released from further potential liabilities to the solvent stamp companies arising out of the wfum pools 

world trade center we acted as the insurance broker but not as an underwriter for the placement of both property and casualty insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted by the september 11 2001 destruction of the world trade center complex including silverstein properties llc which acquired a 99year leasehold interest in the twin towers and related facilities from the port authority of new york and new jersey in july 2001 although the world trade center complex insurance was bound at or before the july 2001 closing of the leasehold acquisition consistent with standard industry practice the final policy wording for the placements was still in the process of being finalized when the twin towers and other buildings in the complex were destroyed on september 11 2001 

there are a number of lawsuits pending in the united states between the insured parties and the insurers for several placements with the silverstein property placement being the most significant of these lawsuits there were two jury trials in the silverstein property suit in which the principal issue was whether the september 11 events constituted one or more occurrences for the purposes of the relevant insurance 

policies the outcome from the two jury trials is that silverstein has 46 billion in coverage as opposed to the 7 billion it was seeking on appeal the verdicts from both jury trials were upheld silverstein and a few insurers have filed petitions with the appellate court for reargument a federal court action was commenced in the southern district of new york on october 19 2005 by cdl hotels usa inc and millennium  copthorne hotels alleging that willis in placing the property insurance failed to procure the amount of business interruption coverage requested by cdl and millennium and confirmed by willis as a result of alleged damages to several of its hotels from the events of september 11 2001 cdl and millennium sought damages in excess of 45 million this matter was settled in november 2006 for an amount which was not material other disputes may also arise in respect of the world trade center insurance placed by us which could affect willis including claims by one or more of the insureds that we made culpable errors or omissions in connection with our brokerage activities however we do not believe that our role as broker will lead to liabilities which in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

proceedings relating to contingent compensation arrangements in april 2005 we entered into an assurance of discontinuance “ny aod” with the new york attorney general and the new york superintendent of insurance resolving the investigation commenced by the new york attorney general in april 2004 which concerned among other things arrangements pursuant to which insurers compensated insurance brokers for distribution and other services provided to insurers and as the investigation of brokers and insurers continued broadened into an investigation of other possible violations of law including violations of fiduciary duty securities laws and antitrust laws pursuant to the ny aod we have paid 50 million to eligible customers we have also agreed to continue certain business reforms we had already implemented and to implement certain other business reforms these reforms include an agreement not to accept contingent compensation and an undertaking to disclose to customers any compensation we will receive in connection with providing policy placement services to the customer we also resolved a similar investigation commenced by the minnesota attorney general by entering into an assurance of discontinuance pursuant to which we paid an additional 1 million to minnesota customers and implemented the business reforms described in the ny aod on october 1 2005 we mailed letters to customers who were eligible to receive distributions out of the fund in march 2006 checks were mailed to eligible customers who elected to participate in the fund eligible customers that elected to participate represented 8793 percent of the 51 million fund as required by the aod the remaining funds were redistributed on a pro rata basis to the participating customers we continue to respond to requests for documents and information by the regulators andor attorneys general of more than twenty other states the district of columbia one us city canada and australia that are conducting similar investigations we are cooperating fully with these investigations and have engaged in discussions with regulators and attorneys general about their investigations  we cannot predict at this time how or when those investigations will be resolved 

our operations in nine european countries have received questionnaires from either the european commission pursuant to its sector inquiry or in respect of norway the european free trade association surveillance authority related to insurance business practices including compensation arrangements for brokers at least 150 other european brokers have received similar questionnaires we responded to the european commission questionnaires within the timeframe set and have filed the european free trade association surveillance authority questionnaire for two of our norwegian entities within the agreed timeframes the european commission reported on an interim basis on january 24 2007 the interim report included preliminary findings of potential conflicts of interest relating to remuneration by assuming a dual role for clients and insurers the european commission has requested by way of consultation responses to the interim report by april 10 2007 and anticipates publishing a final report in september 2007 we continue to cooperate with both the european commission and the european free trade association surveillance authority 

in august 2004 a proceeding was commenced in the superior court of the state of california county of san diego against us by united policyholders an organization purporting to act in a representative capacity on behalf of the california general public the complaint alleged that the compensation arrangements between us and insurance carriers constituted deceptive trade practices and it sought both injunctive and equitable relief including restitution this action was dismissed in december 2004 but united policyholders filed an appeal the dismissal of the complaint was based on the retroactive application of newly passed legislation in july 2006 the supreme court of california confirmed in a ruling that the newly passed legislation applies to cases like the united policyholders case that were pending before the new legislation was enacted based on this ruling united policyholders has dismissed its case 

since august 2004 various plaintiffs have filed purported class actions in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the northern district of illinois the northern district of california the new jersey district court and the circuit court for the eighteenth judicial circuit in and for seminole county florida civil division under a variety of legal theories including state tort contract fiduciary duty and statutory theories and federal antitrust and rico theories and we anticipate that further similar suits could be filed other than a federal suit in illinois that was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff in may 2005 all of the federal actions have been consolidated into two actions in federal court in new jersey one of the consolidated actions addresses employee benefits while the other consolidated action addresses all other lines of insurance in addition to the two federal actions we were also named as a defendant in purported class actions in the eighteenth judicial circuit in and for seminole county florida civil division and commonwealth of massachusetts superior court department of the trial court in june 2006 the plaintiff in the massachusetts state action voluntarily dismissed its complaint with prejudice both the consolidated federal actions and the florida state action name various insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms including us as defendants the complaints seek monetary damages and equitable relief and make allegations regarding the practices and conduct that has been the subject of the investigation of state attorneys general and insurance commissioners including allegations that the brokers have breached their duties to their clients by entering into contingent compensation agreements with either no disclosure or limited disclosure to clients and entered into other improper activities the complaints also allege the existence of a conspiracy among the insurance carriers and brokers and the federal court complaints allege violations of the federal rico statue we dispute these allegations and intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these actions the outcomes of these lawsuits however including any losses or other payments that may occur as a result cannot be predicted at this time 

reinsurance market dispute various legal proceedings are pending have been concluded or may commence between reinsurers reinsureds and in some cases their intermediaries including reinsurance brokers relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance for the years 1993 to 1998 the proceedings principally concern allegations by reinsurers that they have sustained substantial losses due to an alleged abnormal “spiral” in the market in which the reinsurance contracts were placed the existence and nature of which as well as other information was not disclosed to them by the reinsureds or their reinsurance broker a “spiral” is a market term for a situation in which reinsureds and reinsurers reinsure each other with the effect that the same loss or portion of that loss moves through the market multiple times 

the reinsurers concerned have taken the position that despite their decisions to underwrite risks or a group of risks they are no longer bound by their reinsurance contracts as a result they have stopped settling claims and are seeking to recover claims already paid we also understand that there have been two arbitration awards in relation to a spiral among other things in which the reinsurer successfully argued that it was no longer bound by parts of its reinsurance program willis limited our principal insurance brokerage subsidiary in the united kingdom acted as the reinsurance broker or otherwise as 

intermediary but not as an underwriter for numerous personal accident reinsurance contracts including for two contracts that were involved in one of the arbitrations due to the small number of reinsurance brokers generally willis limited was one of a small number of brokers active in the market for this reinsurance during the relevant period we also utilized other brokers active in this market as subagents including brokers who are parties to the legal proceedings described above for certain contracts and may be responsible for any errors and omissions they may have made in july 2003 one of the reinsurers received a judgment in the english high court against certain parties including a subbroker we used to place two of the contracts involved in this trial although neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were a party to this or any other proceeding or arbitration we entered into standstill agreements with certain of the principals to the reinsurance contracts tolling the statute of limitations pending the outcome of proceedings between the reinsureds and reinsurers 

various arbitrations continue to be active and from time to time the principals request our cooperation and suggest that claims may be asserted against the company although at this time no actions are pending against the company the outcome or settlement of some of these arbitrations is pending and may lead to litigation against willis claims may be made against us if reinsurers do not pay claims on policies issued by them it is too early to know what amount of underwriting losses will be alleged to be attributable to an abnormal spiral or the other issues that may be raised or what amount if any reinsureds or reinsurers or other intermediaries may seek to recover from us 

pender insurance limitedcaptive insurance management  we acted through one of our subsidiaries as an independent captive manager for pender from 1990 to 2003 in 2004 legal proceedings were commenced in the english commercial court by cable  wireless plc and pender insurance limited its captive insurer against six of their former employees and certain other individuals and entities and two of our subsidiaries and one of our former employees and were settled in january 2006 for an undisclosed amount which was not material the plaintiffs alleged a fraudulent conspiracy involving the manner in which pender was managed operated or advised by the defendants which allegedly resulted in substantial damages to the plaintiffs a second claim was brought by pender in 2005 alleging negligence with respect to certain reinsurance policies pender mutual insurance company limited “pmic” has recently indicated it has similar claims to pender but no legal proceedings have yet been commenced by pmic if such proceedings are commenced it is not expected the amount claimed will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

gender discrimination class action a federal district court action was commenced against us in 2001 on behalf of an alleged nationwide class of present and former female officer and officer equivalent employees alleging that we discriminated against them on the basis of their gender and seeking injunctive relief money damages attorneys’ fees and costs to date the court has denied plaintiffs’ motions to certify a nationwide class or to grant nationwide discovery but has certified a class of female officers and officer equivalent employees based in our northeast new york new jersey and massachusetts offices we believe that the purported class consists of approximately 200 women we filed a petition for an immediate appeal of the class certification ruling which was denied the parties participated in mediation before a court appointed mediator which has not yet brought about a settlement the trial in this matter has been scheduled in june 2007 we have filed a motion to decertify the class based on new standards set by a recent second circuit opinion for determining whether a class should be certified a former female employee whose motion to intervene in the class action was denied has filed a purported class action with almost identical allegations as those contained in this suit except seeking a class period of 1998 to the time of trial we cannot predict at this time what if any damages might result from these actions

summary 

overview 

the insurance market remained highly competitive throughout 2006 although the aggressive fee cutting and competition for new staff seen in 2005 moderated slightly outside of catastropheexposed markets rates in most sectors have declined throughout the year against this background we are pleased that we achieved our earlier forecasts for 2006 with the full year results reflecting the benefit of strong organic revenue growth improved operating margin and a decrease in the salaries and benefits ratio salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues 

results 2006 compared with 2005 

net income in 2006 was 449   million or 284   per diluted share compared with 281 million or 172 per diluted share in 2005 this increase reflected good organic revenue growth improved operating margin and the benefit of a 71 million tax credit in the fourth quarter which primarily related to the resolution of certain prior year tax matters 

total revenues at 2428   million were 161   million or 7   percent higher than in 2005 as organic revenue growth of 8   percent reflecting net new business growth in all our business units more than offset a small reduction in market remuneration 

operating margin for 2006 was 23   percent compared with 20 percent in 2005 our margins in 2006 and 2005 have been impacted by a number of significant items 

·   a 102   million profit on the sale of our uk head office in second half 2006 equivalent to 4   percent of revenues

·   105   million of expenditure in 2006 in support of our “shaping our future’’ strategic initiatives see “strategic initiative expenditure’’ below equivalent to 4   percent of revenues

·   a 78   million gain on the sale of stewart smith in second quarter 2005 equivalent to 3   percent of revenues and

·   first quarter 2005 charges for regulatory settlements and related costs 60   million the first quarter 2005 headcount reduction program 28   million and a 20   million additional charge for legal provisions following the march 31 2005 review of legal proceedings in total equivalent to 5 percent of revenues

the year on year improvement in 2006 operating margin also reflected lower pension charges than in 2005 the benefit of net new business and increased productivity from recent hires these were partly offset by the impact of lower market remuneration 

results 2005 compared with 2004 

net income in 2005 was 281 million or 172 per diluted share compared with 402 million or 242 per diluted share in 2004 total revenues at 2267 million were 8 million lower than in 2004 as net new business growth and improved client retention rates in all divisions were more than offset by a sharp reduction in market remuneration and falling insurance premium rates 

operating margin in 2005 was 20 percent compared with 28 percent in 2004 with the decline attributable to the sharp reduction in market remuneration increased compensation costs and a negative contribution from foreign currency translation together with first quarter charges of 60 million for regulatory settlements and related costs a 20 million increase in severance payments and a 20 million additional charge for legal provisions following the march 31 2005 review of legal proceedings a 78 million gain on the sale of stewart smith in april 2005 partly offset the adverse impact of the significant first quarter charges 

sale of ten trinity square 

in september 2006 we completed the sale of ten trinity square our uk head office building the building has been leased back until we move into our new head office on lime street in early 2008 gross proceeds were 202 million the total pretax gain on disposal was 121 million of which 99 million was recognized on completion in third quarter 2006 the remaining 22 million equivalent to the net present value of the leaseback rentals is being recognized over the two year expected life of the lease with 3 million having been recognized in fourth quarter 2006 while there is no cash tax payable on the 

disposal due to capital losses carried forward we recognized a tax charge of 8   million on the disposal the sale of our building less related leaseback costs contributed 058 to 2006 earnings per diluted share 

strategic initiative expenditure 

we incurred 105   million of costs in 2006 on initiatives to support our “shaping our future’’ strategy set out above 101 million of this expenditure was incurred in second half 2006 and relates to the following initiatives 

 

  

analyzed by type of expenditure the 101   million of costs in second half 2006 comprised 

 

  

in addition to the significant expenditure in second half 2006 we incurred professional fees for platform redesign of 4 million in the first half of the year 

we expect this expenditure will lead directly to annualized benefits of approximately 65 million pretax by 2009 these benefits include cost reductions attributable to the elimination of nearly 500 positions the benefit of these will be partly offset by additional real estate costs related to our new london and new york headquarters net of these real estate costs we expect the net benefit from these strategic initiatives to be approximately 20 million in 2007 30 million in 2008 and 45 million by 2009 

future outlook 

in 2007 we anticipate that we will continue to grow organic revenue and to expand operating margin modestly we also expect that our adjusted effective tax rate tax rate excluding the effect of tax gains and losses on disposals and other onetime items will be approximately 31 percent 

in the longer term we expect to deliver breakout financial performance in the next four years specifically by full year 2010 we have set financial targets of salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues to be below 54 percent adjusted operating margin operating margin excluding net gains and losses on disposals and other onetime items to be 28 percent or better and to have industry leading organic revenue growth 

acquisitions 

as announced at our investor day in june 2006 we will seek opportunities to acquire new business revenues of 50 million to 100 million per year over the next five years with acquisitions focused on targeted geographies and areas that will reinforce our core businesses through 2006 we spent a total of 98 million on acquisitions completing eight acquisitions of subsidiaries with annual revenues of approximately 30   million for 73 million net of cash acquired and purchasing an additional 5 percent of gras savoye  cie our french associate for 25 million which increased our ownership to 38 percent 

cash and financing 

cash at december 31 2006 was 288   million 95   million higher than at december 31 2005 net cash from operating activities was 147   million despite contributions to the uk and us pension schemes totaling  268 million this together with a 200   million drawdown on our revolving credit facility and the 202   million received from the sale of our london headquarters was used to fund share buybacks of 211   million dividends of 145   million and acquisitions totaling 98   million 

total longterm debt at december 31 2006 was 800   million and stockholders’ equity was  15 billion the capitalization ratio total longterm debt to total longterm debt and stockholders’ equity was 35   percent at december 31 2006 compared with 32 percent at december 31 2005 with the net increase including a 2 percent increase attributable to the adoption of fas 158 see “accounting changes’’ below 

we purchased 54 million of our own shares in 2006 at a cost of 211   million including 38 million shares under an accelerated share repurchase program leaving us with 789 million remaining under our existing 1 billion buyback authorization at december 31 2006 market conditions permitting we expect to utilize the remaining authorization over the next two years or sooner if possible we believe that the strength of our balance sheet would allow us to increase our leverage to fund some of these additional buybacks 

management structure 

effective january 1 2007 we changed our management structure our uk and irish retail operations willis uk and ireland which were previously within our global division have been combined with our previously existing international units to create a single international segment the new international segment incorporates all our retail operations outside north america 

business and market overview 

we provide a broad range of insurance brokerage and risk management consulting services to our worldwide clients our core businesses include aerospace captives construction employee benefits energy financial institutions fine art jewelry and specie healthcare marine programs real estate and reinsurance 

in our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements assisting clients to determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network 

from the late 1980s through late 2000 insurance premium rates generally trended downwards as a result of a number of factors however following several years of underwriting losses the declines in world equity markets and lower interest rates many insurance carriers began to increase premium rates in 2000 the tragic events of september 11 2001 acted as a catalyst especially in areas such as aerospace and rates generally continued to rise through 2003 

during 2004 we saw a rapid transition from a hard market with premium rates stable or increasing to a soft market with premium rates falling in most markets the soft market continued throughout 2005 although the rate of decline moderated in the latter part of the year in addition to the effect of declining rates the latter part of 2004 and 2005 were also impacted by widespread changes to market practices following various regulatory investigations these changes included the elimination of volume and profitbased contingents for global brokers and a significant reduction in other remuneration received from the market 

during 2006 the insurance market has remained highly competitive and outside of catastropheexposed markets rates in most sectors have declined  however marine energy and catastropheexposed american and caribbean property reinsurance terms and conditions have significantly tightened capacity in these markets remains inadequate which together with the shortage of retrocessional reinsurance has led to significant rate increases however in many other sectors of the insurance and reinsurance market pricing and terms continue to soften 

operating results 

revenues 

2006 compared with 2005 

 

i   effective january 1 2006 we changed our reporting structure north america global markets and international global markets revenues which were previously reported within our global division are now reported in the north america and international divisions respectively in addition we refined our method for allocating revenues between our global and north america divisions we have retrospectively adjusted our 2005 revenue analysis to reflect our 2006 structure

ii   organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation acquisitions and disposals and market remuneration from reported revenues we use organic growth as a measure of business growth generated by operations that were part of the group at the end of the period our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited

2006 revenues at 2428   million were 161   million or 7   percent higher than in 2005 with organic revenue growth of 8   percent reflecting strong net new business growth more than offsetting a 1 percent decrease attributable to market remuneration 

our global and international operations earn a significant portion of their revenues in currencies other than the us dollar in 2006 whilst there was no net impact on total reported revenues from the year on year effect of foreign currency translation global revenues benefited by a net 1 percent which mainly reflected stronger average sterling exchange rates against the dollar compared with 2005 

net acquisitions and disposals had a neutral impact on total revenues in 2006 as the benefit of acquisitions in international including mgt corredores de seguros in chile nicon in sweden asesores in peru athos in brazil and acquisitions of minority interests in sweden norway and columbia and global including gueits adams and international insurance brokers inc was offset by the impact of the stewart smith sale in april 2005 

market remuneration continues to decline and at  10 million in 2006 was  19 million lower than in 2005 equivalent to a 1 percent revenue reduction 

organic revenues in 2006 were 8 percent higher than in 2005 reflecting strong net new business growth in all our operations there was a net negligible year on year impact from rates and other market factors as the impact of generally declining rates was offset by other factors including higher commission rates higher insureds and changes in limits or exposures together with significant rate increases in areas with exposures to windstorm and catastrophe 

global   organic revenues were 8 percent higher in 2006 compared with 2005 reflecting net new business growth and a 9 million benefit from the shaping our future client profitability project that was piloted in the global specialty business in the second half of 2006 finex which is our financial and executive risk division niche aerospace and construction all continued to show strong growth

after a mixed first quarter there has been strong growth in the rest of the year in reinsurance compared with 2005 in marine energy and catastropheexposed american and caribbean property terms and conditions have significantly tightened capacity in these markets remains inadequate which together with the shortage of retrocessional reinsurance has led to significant rate increases however in many other sectors of the reinsurance market pricing and terms continue to soften 

elsewhere our global employee benefits practice and global energy practice performed well these are two areas we have identified as high growth potential and are investing in our uk and ireland business also performed well in particular corporate risk solutions showed good growth 

north america north america reported 7 percent organic revenue growth in 2006 with strong growth across the business reflecting the results of our hiring strategy over the past two years and our sales culture geographies doing particularly well in the year include the northeast central and southeast our executive risks and employee benefits practices also continued to perform well

international organic revenue growth in commissions and fees was 8 percent for 2006 compared with 2005 reflecting good business growth despite a declining rate environment latin america in particular venezuela mexico and brazil asia singapore hong kong korea and china iberia and italy all performed well

2005 compared with 2004 

 

i   following a change to our internal reporting structure effective january 1 2006 north america global markets and international global markets revenues which were previously reported within our global division are now reported in the north america and international divisions respectively in addition we refined our method of allocating revenues between the global and north america divisions as a result of these changes 109 million of revenues previously reported within our global division in 2005 2004 123 million have been reclassified between the north america 45 million and international divisions 64 million 2004 north america 46 million and international 77 million

ii   organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation acquisitions and disposals and market remuneration from reported revenues we use organic growth as a measure of business growth generated by operations that were part of the group at the end of the period our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited

2005 revenues at 2267 million were broadly in line with 2004 with the benefit of an increase from net new business growth and an increase attributable to net acquisitions and disposals being offset by the reduction in market remuneration 

net acquisitions and disposals added 1 percent to total revenues in 2005 compared with 2004 in global the benefit of recent acquisitions mainly the coyle hamilton and opus acquisitions in second half 2004 was offset by the impact of the stewart smith sale in april 2005 in north america growth attributable to acquisitions was mainly due to the cgi consulting and primary acquisitions in first quarter 2005 

market remuneration was significantly lower in 2005 at 29 million compared with 148 million in 2004 this reduction followed our announcement in october 2004 that we were voluntarily abolishing contingent commission arrangements 

organic revenues in 2005 were 5 percent higher than in 2004 with net new business growth in all our operations and improved client retention in 2005 only partly offset by soft or declining rates in most of our markets 

global   organic revenues were 5 percent higher in 2005 compared with 2004 rates were soft in virtually all the sectors we operated in and in the reinsurance market we saw a trend towards more centralized buying and higher retentions despite the highly competitive market net new business growth improved and we saw some benefit in the london market from market remuneration migrating to fees our aerospace and niche businesses in global specialties performed well

north america   north america reported 5 percent revenue growth in 2005 compared with 2004 despite declining rates particularly in the first half of 2005 net new business growth remained robust 

across all regions and businesses with improved retention rates also a significant contributor overall most regional sectors performed well and we saw good growth in the financial institutions and large account practices in our large account practice we saw a sustained increase in requests for proposals with total new business in 2005 higher than that achieved in 2004 

international   international revenues were 4 percent higher than in 2004 as net new business growth and improved client retention in most regions more than offset the impact of a further softening of rates in many areas south africa russia latin america and asia all performed well

general and administrative expenses 

 

  

2006 compared with 2005 

general and administrative expenses at 1911   million for 2006 were 122   million or 7   percent higher than in 2005 foreign currency translation had a net 1 percent adverse impact and there was a net nil impact from acquisitions net of disposals

general and administrative expenses have been adversely impacted by significant charges in both 2006 and 2005 in 2006 we incurred 96   million of expenditure on strategic initiatives as discussed above and in 2005 we incurred significant first quarter charges relating to the first quarter 2005 headcount reduction program 28 million a 20 million additional charge for legal provisions and 9 million of costs related to regulatory settlements 

salaries and benefits were 1457   million in 2006 compared with 1384 million in 2005 the compensation ratio salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues at 60   percent was down from 61   percent in 2005 and was mainly impacted by 

·   pensions

the pension charge in 2006 was  33 million lower than in 2005 which was mainly attributable to an increased return on assets in the uk plan due to higher asset levels reflecting the good returns in 2005 and increased contributions by the company and an increase in the expected rate of return assumption from 725 percent to 775 percent in addition the us charge benefited from savings attributable to the 2005 headcount reduction program and 

·   the benefit of net new business and an increased revenue contribution from our recent hires

offset by 

·   severance

severance costs were 41   million in 2006 of which 35   million related to our strategic initiatives under which nearly 500 positions have been eliminated severance costs were  30 million in 2005 of which 28 million related to a headcount reduction program in first quarter 2005 under which approximately 500 positions were eliminated we do not expect to initiate a major headcount reduction program in 2007 and therefore expect severance costs will be significantly lower in 2007 compared with both 2006 and 2005 

·   a  19 million reduction in market remuneration

net headcount on a fulltime equivalent basis at december 31 2006 was approximately 13000 compared with 12800 at december 31 2005 for the year ended december 31 2006 average revenues per employee were approximately  186000 compared with 174000 per employee for fiscal 2005 

other expenses at 454   million were 49   million or 12   percent higher than in 2005 of which 1 percent was attributable to the impact of net acquisitions and disposals and 1 percent to foreign currency translation 

other expenses were 19   percent of revenues in 2006 compared with 18 percent in 2005 with the net increase mainly attributable to 

·   the 37   million expenditure on strategic initiatives in 2006 partly offset by

·   an additional 20 million provision for legal claims following the march 31 2005 review of legal proceedings and 9 million of legal costs relating to the 2005 regulatory settlements

2005 compared with 2004 

general and administrative expenses at 1789 million in 2005 were 180 million or 11 percent higher than in 2004 of which 3 percent was attributable to acquisitions net of disposals and foreign currency translation 

salaries and benefits were 1384 million or 61 percent of revenues in 2005 compared with 1218 million or 54 percent of revenues in 2004 the increase in the compensation ratio salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues was mainly attributable to the 119 million reduction in market remuneration and the incremental cost of net new hires and higher costs to retain and incentivize existing staff together with a 20 million increase in severance costs primarily relating to the first quarter 2005 headcount reduction program and the impact of foreign currency translation excluding severance costs relating to the first quarter headcount reduction program the compensation ratio was 60 percent in 2005 

other expenses at 405 million were 4 percent higher than 2004 of which 5 percent was attributable to acquisitions net of disposals and foreign currency translation there was an underlying decrease of 1 percent despite an additional 20 million provision for legal claims following the march 31 2005 review of legal cases and increased legal costs mainly relating to regulatory proceedings this decrease reflected strong controls on discretionary spending throughout 2005 

regulatory settlements 

as discussed in detail in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements we entered into agreements with the new york attorney general the new york superintendent of insurance and the minnesota attorney general in second quarter 2005 under which we paid 51 million into bank accounts for reimbursement funds 

operating income and margin 

 

  

2006 compared with 2005 

operating margin was 23 percent in 2006 compared with 20 percent in 2005 our margins in 2006 and 2005 have been impacted by a number of significant items 

·   the 102 million profit on the sale of our uk head office in second half 2006 equivalent to 4 percent of revenues

·   105 million of expenditure in 2006 in support of our “shaping our future’’ strategic initiatives equivalent to 4 percent of revenues

·   the 78 million gain on the sale of stewart smith in 2005 equivalent to 3 percent of revenues and

·   first quarter 2005 charges for regulatory settlements and related costs 60 million the first quarter 2005 headcount reduction program 28 million and a 20 million additional charge for legal provisions following the march 31 2005 review of legal proceedings in total equivalent to 5 percent of revenues

the year on year improvement in 2006 operating margin also reflected lower pension charges the benefit of net new business and increased productivity from recent hires partly offset by the impact of lower market remuneration 

2005 compared with 2004 

operating margin at 20 percent for 2005 was significantly lower than 2004 and was impacted by 

·   the first quarter 2005 provision for regulatory settlements of 51 million and related legal costs of 9 million

·   a 20 million increase in severance costs primarily as a result of the first quarter 2005 headcount reduction program

·   an additional 20 million increase in the provision for claims following the march 31 2005 review of legal proceedings and

·   a 67 million increase in net gains on disposal compared with 2004 mainly reflecting the 78 million gain on the sale of stewart smith in second quarter 2005

the net effect of these items was to reduce operating margin by 1 percent the remaining decline in operating margin was mainly attributable to the 119 million reduction in market remuneration increased retention and recruitment costs the impact of foreign currency translation and the effect of stewart smith which was sold in april 2005 

interest expense 

interest expense in 2006 was 38 million compared with 30 million in 2005 and 22 million in 2004 with the increases mainly due to higher average levels of debt at higher interest rates following the replacement of the 450 million term loan with 600 million of senior notes in july 2005 as part of our long term capital structure planning and the 200 million drawdown on the revolving credit facility in the latter part of 2006 

income taxes 

 

  

the effective tax rate in 2006 was 12 percent compared with 34 percent in 2005 the lower effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a 65 million tax credit arising in fourth quarter 2006 and a low effective tax rate on the capital gain on the disposal of our uk head office building the tax credit reflects the resolution of complex tax issues relating to the original kkr acquisition structure and subsequent internal restructurings in addition there was a 6 million credit in fourth quarter 2006 relating to deferred tax on acquired intangibles the 71 million fourth quarter tax credit contributed  045 to diluted earnings per share in 2006 

the effective tax rate in 2005 was 34 percent the net impact of the effect of tax on net disposals the amortization of intangibles and the 60 million of regulatory settlements and related costs was 2 percent of which approximately 3 percent was attributable to the 78 million profit on disposal of stewart smith and a negative 1 percent to the tax effect of the regulatory settlements and related costs excluding the effect of tax on net disposals of operations the amortization of intangible assets and regulatory settlements and related costs the underlying tax rate was 32 percent compared with 33 percent in 2004 which contributed approximately 004 to diluted earnings per share in 2005 

net income and earnings per diluted share 

 

  

2006 compared with 2005 

net income for 2006 was 449 million or 284 per diluted share compared with 281 million or 172 per diluted share in 2005 net income in both 2006 and 2005 has been impacted by a number of significant items the third quarter 2006 sale of our london head office building less related leaseback costs equivalent to 058 per diluted share the 2006 “shaping our future’’ expenditure equivalent to 047 per diluted share the 71 million tax credit in fourth quarter 2006 equivalent to 045 per diluted share the gain on the sale of stewart smith in second quarter 2005 equivalent to 025 per diluted share and the first quarter 2005 charges for regulatory settlements and related costs the headcount reduction program and the march 31 2005 review of legal proceedings equivalent to 043 per diluted share 

foreign currency translation had a negative  002 impact on earnings per diluted share in 2006 compared with 2005 a five million reduction in average diluted share count contributed  009 to 2006 diluted earnings per share 

2005 compared with 2004 

net income for 2005 was 281 million or 172 per diluted share compared with 402 million or 242 per diluted share in 2004 net income in 2005 was impacted by a number of significant items the 36 million posttax cost of regulatory settlements in first quarter 2005 together with related legal costs 

equivalent to 022 per diluted share the 19 million posttax cost of the first quarter 2005 headcount reduction program equivalent to 012 per diluted share the 14 million posttax cost of the additional 20 million provision for legal claims following the march 31 2005 review of legal cases equivalent to 009 per diluted share and the 41 million posttax net gain on disposal of operations primarily relating to the second quarter 2005 sale of stewart smith equivalent to 025 per diluted share the decrease excluding these significant items was mainly attributable to the reduction in market remuneration increased retention and recruitment costs the impact of foreign currency translation and the effect of stewart smith which was sold in april 2005 partly offset by the lower tax rate 

excluding the gain on disposal in second quarter 2005 stewart smith’s results contributed nil to net income per diluted share in 2005 and 012 in 2004 the following table shows the impact of stewart smith on results in the periods prior to sale 

 

  

foreign currency translation reduced net income per diluted share by approximately 006 for fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 

accounting changes 

sharebased compensation 

effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas 123r  using the modifiedretrospective transition method under that transition method compensation cost recognized from january 1 2006 includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  and b compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas 123r 

results for all prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to recognize the compensation cost previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of fas 123 

as a consequence of the adoption of fas 123r we recognized sharebased compensation of 18 million in both 2006 and 2005 

in addition to the income statement the adoption of fas 123r impacted our prior period diluted sharecount with diluted sharecount for 2005 being reduced by 1 million to 163 million and 2004 diluted sharecount by 2 million to 166 million as proceeds under the treasury stock method were adjusted the proceeds were adjusted to include average unrecognized compensation cost outstanding in the period and for changes to the calculation of future tax consequences when we reported previously under apb 25 time options granted at market value gave no rise to an accounting charge and hence there was no increase from unrecognized compensation cost to assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method 

pensions marketrelated value 

effective january 1 2006 the company changed the methodology used to determine the marketrelated value of uk pension plan assets 

fas 87 employers’ accounting for pensions  requires the expected return on plan assets to be determined based on the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the marketrelated value of plan assets the marketrelated value of plan assets may either be a fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years 

the company has two principal defined benefit plans one in the united kingdom and the other in the united states prior to january 1 2006 the marketrelated value of the uk pension plan assets was determined using a calculated value that recognized asset gains or losses over five years whereas the marketrelated value of us pension plan assets was determined on a fair value basis effective january 1 2006 the company changed its method for determining the marketrelated value of uk pension plan assets to a fair value basis the company believes that fair value is a preferable measure of determining the marketrelated value of plan assets as it more fairly reflects the actual value of pension plan assets as of the balance sheet date in addition it aligns the methodology used for calculating the marketrelated value of plan assets for the company’s two principal defined benefit plans 

in accordance with fas 154 accounting changes and error corrections the change in method of determining the marketrelated value of plan assets has been applied retrospectively by adjusting all prior periods presented 

the impact of this retrospective adjustment is to increase the uk pension charge for 2005 by 10 million to 41 million and for 2004 by 27 million to 35 million with a related adverse impact on diluted earnings per share for 2005 of 004 and on 2004 diluted earnings per share of 009 the increase in the 2005 and 2004 uk pension charges as a result of the change in accounting methodology is mainly attributable to the recognition under the fair value method of net prior period asset losses brought forward at january 1 2005 and 2004 that had previously been deferred under the calculated value methodology the recognition of these losses 

·   reduces the market related value of assets at january 1 2005 and 2004 which consequentially reduces the return on assets leading to an increase in the 2005 and 2004 pension charges and

·   increases actuarial losses at january 1 2005 and 2004 which leads to an increased amortization charge and consequently a further increase in the 2005 and 2004 pension charges

if we had used the previous calculated value methodology in 2006 the uk pension expense for 2006 would have been 23 million higher the lower charge under the new fair value methodology mainly reflects the recognition of net asset gains at january 1 2006 that would have been deferred under the calculated value methodology the recognition of these gains 

·   increased the market related value of assets at january 1 2006 which consequentially increased the return on assets leading to a decrease in the 2006 pension charge and

·   reduced actuarial losses at january 1 2006 which led to a lower amortization charge and consequently a further decrease in the 2006 pension charge

pensions—adoption of fas 158 

·   in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued fas 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r  ‘fas 158’ which required an employer to

·   recognize in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation

·   recognize net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost

·   measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s statement of financial position and

·   disclose additional information in the notes to the financial statements about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition asset or obligation

the requirements of fas 158 are applied prospectively upon adoption the requirements to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and provide related disclosures are effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 and have been applied for the year ended december 31 2006 the adoption of fas 158 has resulted in a 189 million post tax charge to other comprehensive income as at december 31 2006 

critical accounting estimates 

the company’s accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of the company’s financial condition or operating performance management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our audit committee 

pension expense 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all our employees in the united states and united kingdom although the uk plan was closed to new entrants in january 2006 new entrants in the united kingdom will now be offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan elsewhere pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans 

we make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate the discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected longterm return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination 

effective january 1 2006 we increased our longterm expected rate of return assumption for our uk pension plan assets from 725 percent to 775 percent this change reflects management’s best estimate of the longer term performance of the uk fund taking into account average returns over the last ten years the current asset mix and market expectations the increase in the longterm rate of return on assets assumption benefited the 2006 pension expense by approximately 9 million 

net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans in 2006 was 29 million a decrease of 33 million compared with 2005 of which 25 million related to the uk plan the decrease in the uk expense was mainly attributable to an increased return on assets in the uk plan due to higher asset 

levels reflecting the good returns in 2005 and increased contributions by the company and an increase in the expected rate of return assumption from 725 percent to 775 percent the us pension charge was 8 million lower in 2006 with the decrease mainly due to savings attributable to the 2005 headcount reduction program 

based on december 31 2006 assumptions we expect our net pension expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately 35 million compared with 2006 principally attributable to a 25 million increase in the expected return on uk plan assets partly reflecting higher asset levels following the incremental contributions made in 2006 

uk plan 

 

1   with all other assumptions held constant

2   assumes all plan participants are one year younger

expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net uk pension expense in 2006 was 775 percent up from 725 percent in 2005 and equivalent to an expected return in 2006 of 143 million the actual return in 2006 was 141 million 

rates used to discount pension plan liabilities at december 31 2006 were based on yields prevailing at that date of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity the selected rate used to discount uk plan liabilities was 53 percent compared with 49 percent at december 31 2005 with the increase reflecting an increase in long term bond rates in the united kingdom during 2006 the higher discount rate at december 31 2006 generated an actuarial gain of 151 million at december 31 2006 which was partly offset by a 53 million actuarial loss attributable to an increase in the inflation assumption 

mortality assumptions at december 31 2006 were unchanged from december 31 2005 as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a uk male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2006 would have a life expectancy of 20 years 

us plan 

 

1   with all other assumptions held constant

2   assumes all plan participants are one year younger

the expected longterm rate of return used for determining the net us pension expense in 2006 was 80 percent compared with an actual return of 146 percent the rate used to discount us plan liabilities at december 31 2006 was 60 percent determined based on expected plan cash flows discounted using a corporate bond yield curve an increase of 025 percent compared with the rate used at december 31 2005 

the mortality assumption for the us plan at december 31 2006 was unchanged from 2005 as an indication of the longevity assumed our calculations assume that a us male retiree aged 65 at december 31 2006 would have a life expectancy of 18 years 

income taxes 

we are subject to the income tax laws of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate principally the united states and united kingdom these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by taxpayers and the tax authorities when establishing income tax provisions we therefore make a number of judgments and interpretations about the application and interaction of these tax laws we have estimated tax reserves that we believe are adequate in relation to the potential for future assessments once established we only adjust tax reserves when more information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to tax reserves changes in these tax laws or our interpretations of these laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact our effective tax rate and results of operations in a given period 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards we estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies 

at december 31 2006 the company had gross deferred tax assets of 247 million 2005 319 million against which a valuation allowance of 73 million 2005 110 million had been recognized to the extent that the actual future taxable income in the periods during which the temporary differences are expected to reverse differs from current projections or assumed prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to materialize or new tax planning strategies are developed or material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry forward time limits the company may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

we purchase professional indemnity insurance which in part covers the errors and omission claims arising in the ordinary course of business the terms of this insurance vary by policy year and selfinsured risks have increased significantly over recent years we have established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice 

new accounting standards 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb’’ issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48’’ which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 

the evaluation of a tax position under fin 48 is a twostep process 

·   the first step is recognition

tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return should be recognized only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold it should be presumed that the position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 

·   the second step is measurement

tax positions that meet the recognition criteria are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being recognized upon ultimate settlement 

fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and will be adopted by the company as of january 1 2007 

the company has evaluated the impact of adopting fin 48 and has concluded that it will not be material 

liquidity and capital resources 

on july 26 2006 the board authorized a new share buyback program for 1 billion this replaced our previous 500 million buyback program and its remaining 140 million authorization we purchased 54 million shares in 2006 at a cost of 211   million including 38 million shares under an accelerated share repurchase program leaving us with 789 million remaining under our 1 billion buyback authorization at december 31 2006 market conditions permitting we expect to utilize the remaining authorization over the next two years or sooner if possible we believe that the strength of our balance sheet would allow us to increase our leverage to fund some of these additional buybacks 

operating activities 

as an intermediary we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers we report premiums which are held on account of or due from clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers claims held by or due to us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities all these balances due or payable are included in accounts receivable and accounts payable on the balance sheet we earn interest on these funds during the time between the receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid out fiduciary cash must be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which generally emphasize capital preservation and liquidity and is not generally available to service our debt or for other corporate purposes 

net cash provided by operating activities which excludes fiduciary cash movements was 147 million in 2006 compared with 95 million in 2005 and 360 million in 2004 in 2006 we paid contributions into our uk and us pension funds of  268 million compared with  104 million in 2005 and  51 million in 2004 compared with 2004 both 2006 and 2005 cash inflows have been lower as a result of the abolition of volume and profitbased contingent commissions and the significant reduction in other market remuneration 

net cash provided by operations in 2005 was also adversely impacted by a reclassification of approximately 134 million own funds to fiduciary funds under financial services authority “fsa” regulations in the united kingdom which came into force in january 2005 and affected the timing of transferring commissions from fiduciary funds to own funds the regulations changed the basis for the withdrawal of commissions from fiduciary funds to own funds from an earned to a receipts basis with a consequential increase in fiduciary funds and decrease in own funds 

investing activities 

total net cash provided by investing activities was 67 million in 2006 compared with 32 million in 2005 and a 183 million outflow in 2004 

cash used for acquisitions of subsidiaries in 2006 amounted to 73 million net of cash acquired and was primarily incurred in acquiring gueits adams  company and international insurance brokers inc in the united states reinsurance consultants in south africa nicon in sweden mgt corredores de seguros in chile and acquisitions of minority interests in sweden norway and columbia 

in september 2006 we acquired a further 5 percent of gras savoye  cie our french associate for 25 million bringing our total interest to 38 percent the acquisition was pursuant to a put arrangement we entered into in 1997 see ‘contractual obligations’ below 

in september 2006 we also completed the sale of our uk head office at ten trinity square gross proceeds from the sale were 202 million we have leased back the property at an annual rental of 12 million until 2008 when we expect to move into our new london offices 

net cash proceeds from the sale of operations in 2005 totaled 90 million pretax and were mainly attributable to the sale of stewart smith on april 14 2005 cash used for acquisitions in 2005 amounted to 35 million net of cash acquired was primarily incurred in acquiring cgi consulting group inc now willis benefits of pennsylvania inc a us employee benefits firm and primary worldwide corporation in the us cr king and partners limited in the united kingdom jh asesores y corredores de seguros sa a peruvian broker kr athos consultoria e corretora de seguros de vida sc ltd a brazilian employee benefits firm and essence a taiwanese broker 

cash used for acquisitions in 2004 totaled 147 million net of cash acquired the cash was used primarily for the acquisitions of coyle hamilton the republic of ireland’s largest privately owned insurance broker the controlling interest in willis as denmark’s largest insurance broker two reinsurance brokers in italy and denmark and opus a regional insurance broking business in the united kingdom 

we have historically funded acquisitions with cash or a combination of cash and equity depending on the acquisition and the economics of the transaction we would expect this pattern to continue 

capital expenditures for 2006 2005 and 2004 were 55 million 32 million and 49 million respectively we have funded our requirements for capital expenditures by cash generated internally from operations and expect to continue to do so in the future 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities amounted to 129 million in 2006 compared with 270 million in 2005 and 203 million in 2004 

we continued to buy back shares in 2006 repurchasing 54 million shares for 211 million during the year compared with 103 million shares for 360 million in 2005 and 93 million shares at a cost of 339 million in 2004 

we increased our external debt by 200 million in 2006 by drawing down on our revolving credit facility with the increase primarily funding our increased pension contributions in 2005 the completion of our senior notes offering of 600 million in july 2005 and the subsequent repayment of the 450 million term loan generated a net cash inflow of 143 million there was a net inflow of 63 million from refinancing debt in 2004 

excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements were 11 million in 2006 compared with 45 million in 2005 and 130 million in 2004 reflecting a decrease in the level of options exercised over the period 

cash div idends paid in 2006 were 145 million compared with 135   million in 2005 and 115   million in 2004 in february 2007 the quarterly cash dividend declared was increased by 6 percent to 025 per share an annual rate of 100 per share at this rate the expected annual cost of dividends payable in 2007 will be approximately  150 million we have funded dividends from cash generated internally by operations and expect to do so in the future 

as of december 31 2006 we had cash and cash equivalents of 288 million compared with 193 million at december 31 2005 and 100 million of our 300 million revolving credit facility remained available to draw 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations at december 31 2006 were 

 

i   our revolving credit facility expires in october 2010 under the facility we have the ability to drawdown funds which reprice at libor plus 0375 for the drawdown period interest on this revolving credit facility has not been included in the above table as we are not able to predict when and how much we will draw on the facility in the future

ii   based on the earliest dates on which options could be exercised

in november 2004 we entered into a 25 year agreement with british land plc relating to our new uk headquarters in london construction commenced in early 2005 and our occupancy is targeted for early 2008 our contractual obligations in relation to this commitment totaling 918 million are included in the table above but are contingent upon the successful completion of construction 

following changes to uk pensions legislation in 2005 we are now required to agree a funding strategy for our uk defined benefit plan with the plan’s trustees in january 2006 we agreed to make additional 2007 contributions of 98 million 

in connection with many of our investments in less than whollyowned subsidiaries and associates we retain rights to increase our ownership percentage over time typically to a majority or 100 percent ownership position in addition in certain instances the other owners have a right typically at a 

price calculated pursuant to a formula based on revenues or earnings to put some or all of their shares to us 

as part of the 1997 acquisition of our initial 33 percent shareholding of gras savoye we entered into a put arrangement whereby the other shareholders in gras savoye primarily two families two insurance companies and gras savoye’s executive management team could put their shares to us until 2011 we will be obligated to buy the shares of certain shareholders to the extent those shareholders put their shares potentially increasing our ownership from 38 percent to 90 percent if all shareholders put their shares at a price determined by a contractual formula based on earnings and revenue we acquired an additional 5 percent of gras savoye at a cost of 25 million under these arrangements in september 2006 management shareholders of gras savoye representing approximately 10 percent of shares do not have general put rights before 2011 but have certain put rights on their death disability or retirement from which payments at december 31 2006 based on the formula would not have exceeded 64 million the shareholders may put their shares individually at any time during the put period 

while neither we nor the management of gras savoye expect significant exercises of the puts on a separate or aggregate basis in the near to medium term we nevertheless believe that should the aggregate amount of shares be put to us sufficient funds would be available to satisfy this obligation in addition we have a call option to move to majority ownership under certain circumstances and in any event by december 2009 upon exercising this call option the remaining gras savoye shareholders have a put option 

offbalance sheet transactions 

apart from commitments guarantees and contingencies as disclosed in note 9 of the consolidated financial statements the company has no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity 




 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives we do not hold derivative or financial instruments for trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements and further disclosure is provided in note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

foreign exchange risk management 

we conduct our business in over 100 currencies accordingly movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in the united kingdom however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside the united states and the united kingdom we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2006 

 

  

our operations are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from cash flows and financial instruments that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our primary foreign exchange risk arises from changes in the exchange rates between us dollars and pounds sterling our objective is to maximize our cash flow in us dollars generally our policy is to convert into pounds sterling all revenue arising in currencies other than us dollars together with sufficient us dollar revenues to fund the remaining pound sterling expenses outside the united kingdom only those cash flows necessary to fund mismatches between revenues and expenses are converted into local currency amounts remitted to the united kingdom are usually converted into pounds sterling and the currency exposures managed by entering into forward exchange contracts generally it is our policy to hedge at least 25 percent of the next 12 months’ exposure in significant currencies we do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within three years 

 

  

 

1   represents the difference between the contract amount and the cash flow in us dollars which would have been receivable had the foreign currency forward exchange contracts been entered into on december 31 2006 or 2005 at the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date

interest rate risk management 

our operations are financed principally by 600 million fixed rate senior notes issued by a subsidiary which are split between 250 million due 2010 and 350 million due 2015 as of december 31 2006 we had also drawn down 200 million on our 300 million revolving credit facility which expires in 2010 the interest rate applicable to this borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown 

we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in both us dollars and pounds sterling 

as a consequence of our insurance and reinsurance broking activities there is a delay between the time we receive cash for premiums and claims and the time the cash needs to be paid we earn interest on this float which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income this float is regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which it may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity we manage the interest rate risk arising from this exposure primarily through the use of interest rate swaps it is our policy that for currencies with significant balances a minimum of 25 percent of forecast income arising is hedged for each of the next three years 

the table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest for interest rate swaps the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts the duration of interest rate swaps varies between one and four years with refixing periods of three months average fixed and variable rates are respectively the weightedaverage actual and market rates for the interest hedges in place market rates are the rates prevailing at december 31 2006 or 2005 as appropriate

the following is a list of the major international associate investments currently held by us and our interest as of december 31 2004 

 in connection with many of our investments we retain rights to increase our ownership percentage over time typically to a majority or 100 ownership position in addition in certain instances our coshareholders have a right typically based on some price formula of revenues or earnings to put some or all of their shares to us see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to our strategic investments in associates we have acquired a controlling interest in a broad geographic spread of other brokers the following is a list of the significant international subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest and our interest as of december 31 2004 

 1 we have a 501 interest in the company customers 

our customers operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational corporations to middle market companies further many of our client relationships span decades for instance our relationship 

with the tokio marine and fire insurance company limited dates back over 100 years no one client accounted for more than 10 of revenues for fiscal year 2004 additionally we place insurance with over 5000 insurance carriers none of which individually accounted for more than 11 of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2004 

competition 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate according to the july 2004 edition of business insurance the 162 largest commercial insurance brokers globally reported brokerage revenues totalling 302 billion in 2003 the insurance brokerage industry is led by three global participants marsh  mclennan companies inc with approximately 31 of the worldwide market in 2003 referred to above aon corporation with approximately 22 of the worldwide market in 2003 and us with approximately 7 of the worldwide market in 2003 the industry is highly fragmented beyond these three brokers with the next largest broker having approximately 4 of the worldwide market 

competition in the insurance brokerage and risk management businesses in general is based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price our global capability and product breadth is similar to those of the two other global brokers and thus we compete with them primarily based on innovation quality of service and price in addition we compete with numerous specialist regional and local firms insurance companies also compete with our brokers by directly soliciting insureds without the assistance of an independent broker or agent competition for premiums is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example insurers are currently retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies are increasingly relying upon captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buying insurance we and our competitors provide management and similar services for those alternative risk transfer programs additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services our market share has been stable in recent years we believe that our strategies of building on our strong global franchise expanding on our employee benefit capabilities increasing our operating efficiencies and creating a single company culture will allow us to retain and gain clients in the competitive marketplace we also believe that our market position will provide us with opportunities to acquire smaller companies with strong regional presence or specialized expertise 

regulation 

the manner in which we conduct our business is subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasigovernmental regulatory supervision in virtually all countries in which we operate these requirements are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria 

throughout 2004 our business activities in the united kingdom were regulated by the general insurance standards council as well as by the financial services authority 

all european union member states were required to implement the european union insurance mediation directive by january 2005 the directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the eu on a basis consistent with the eu single market and customer protection aims each eu member state was required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country were registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary met professional requirements in relation to their competence good repute professional indemnity cover and financial 

capacity in the united kingdom the statutory body is the financial services authority from january 14 2005 the financial services authority became the sole regulator of insurance and reinsurance intermediary businesses in the united kingdom 

the financial services authority has prescribed the methods by which our insurance and reinsurance operations are to conduct business the financial services authority generally conduct their regulatory functions through the establishment of net worth and other financial criteria they also require the submission of reports and have investigative and disciplinary powers monitoring visits are carried out to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements 

further our clients have the right to file complaints with our regulators about our services and the regulators may conduct an investigation or require us to conduct an investigation into these complaints our failure or that of our employees to satisfy the regulators that we are in compliance with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities can result in disciplinary action fines reputational damage and financial harm 

our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the united states are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction insurance laws in the united states are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities that supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions 

all companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to that regulation which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the united kingdom and united states we do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position 

employees 

as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 12400 employees worldwide of whom approximately 4000 were employed in each of the united kingdom and the united states with the balance being employed across the rest of the world in addition our associates had approximately 3400 employees all of whom were located outside the united kingdom and the united states 

risks relating to our business 

this section describes the material risks affecting the groups business these risks could materially affect the groups business its revenues operating income net income net assets and liquidity and capital resources and accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forwardlooking statements in this annual report on form 10k 

premiums and commissions—we do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability 

we derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokering and consulting services we do not determine insurance premiums on which commissions are generally based premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions from the late 1980s through late 2000 insurance premium rates generally declined as a result of a number of factors including the expanded underwriting capacity of insurance carriers consolidation of both insurance intermediaries and insurance carriers and increased competition among insurance carriers 

in addition as traditional riskbearing insurance carriers continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated agents or brokers such as ourselves those insurance carriers may 

seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly undermine our profitability 

claims lawsuits and other proceedings—our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist our clients with matters including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims involving substantial amounts of money errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include allegations of damages for our employees or subagents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us have subject to our selfinsured deductibles been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

the principal actual or potential claims lawsuits and proceedings to which we are currently subject are i claims relating to services provided by one of our uk subsidiaries willis faber underwriting management limited to another subsidiary sovereign that was engaged in insurance underwriting prior to 1991 as well as certain third party insurance companies ii potential claims which could be asserted with respect to our placement of property and casualty insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted by the september 11 2001 destruction of new yorks world trade center complex iii potential regulatory and other proceedings relating to contingent compensation arrangements iv potential claims arising out of various legal proceedings between reinsurers reinsureds and their reinsurance brokers relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance placements for the years 1993 to 1998 and v potential claims arising out of legal proceedings by cable  wireless plc and pender insurance limited its captive insurer against the company and others in respect of the provision of captive management services to pender see item 3 legal proceedings 

regulation—we are subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements we may not be able to conduct our business 

many of our activities are subject to regulatory supervision in virtually all the countries in which we are based or our activities are undertaken failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary action including requiring clients to be compensated for loss the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate in addition changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators including changes in administration and enforcement policies could from time to time require operational improvements or modifications at various locations which could result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business see item 1 business—regulation 

put and call arrangements—we have entered into significant put and call arrangements which may require us to pay substantial amounts to purchase shares in one of our associates those payments would reduce our cash flow and the funds available to grow our business 

in connection with many of our investments in our associates we retain rights to increase our ownership percentages over time and in some cases the existing owners also have a right to put their shares to us the put arrangement in place for shares of our associate gras savoye may require us to pay substantial amounts to purchase those shares which could decrease our liquidity and the funds available to grow our business see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the rights under the put arrangement may be exercised through 2011 if fully exercised we would be required to buy shares of gras savoye other than those held by its management possibly increasing our ownership interest from 33 to 90 management shareholders of gras savoye representing approximately 10 of the outstanding shares do not have general put rights before 2011 but have certain put rights on their death disability or retirement payments in connection with management put rights would not have exceeded 65 million if those rights had been fully exercised at december 31 2004 

during 2005 the incremental 57 of gras savoye may be put to us at a price equal to the greater of approximately 800 million french francs 166 million at december 31 2004 exchange rates or a price determined by a contractual formula based on earnings and revenue which at december 31 2004 would have amounted to approximately 368 million after 2005 the put price is determined solely by the formula the shareholders may put their shares individually at any time during the put period the amounts we may have to pay in connection with the put arrangements may significantly exceed these estimates 

competition—competition in our industry is intense and if we are unable to compete effectively we may lose market share and our business may be materially adversely affected 

we face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability product breadth innovation quality of service and price we compete with marsh  mclennan and aon the two other providers of global risk management services as well as with numerous specialist regional and local firms if we are unable to compete effectively against these competitors we will suffer lower revenue reduced operating margins and loss of market share 

competition for business is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market and the other two providers of global risk management services have substantially greater market share than we do competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business for example insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously industrial and commercial companies have been increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary insurance companies known as captive insurance companies selfinsurance pools risk retention groups mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks rather than buying insurance additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants such as banks accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves offering risk management or transfer services see item 1 business—competition 

dependence on key personnel—the loss of any member of our senior management particularly our chairman and chief executive officer or a significant number of our brokers could negatively affect our financial plans marketing and other objectives 

the loss of or failure to attract key personnel could significantly impede our financial plans growth marketing and other objectives our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our senior management particularly our chairman and chief executive officer joseph j plumeri but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships the insurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense 

competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors in the past we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand train and manage our employee base we may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense 

international operations—our significant nonus operations particularly those in the united kingdom expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the united states accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries hyperinflation in certain foreign countries imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in dollars in the united kingdom however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside the united states and the united kingdom we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency the table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2004 

 because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into dollars we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations in addition to economic exposure furthermore the mismatch between sterling revenues and expenses creates an exchange exposure as the pound sterling strengthens the dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase which then causes our results to be negatively impacted given these facts the strength of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results this risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations in the future 

our policy is to convert into pounds sterling all revenues arising in currencies other than us dollars together with sufficient us dollar revenues to fund the remaining pounds sterling expenses outside the united kingdom only those cash flows necessary to fund mismatches between revenues and expenses are converted into local currency amounts remitted to the united kingdom are generally converted into pounds sterling these transactional currency exposures are generally managed by entering into forward exchange contracts it is our policy to hedge at least 25 of the next 12 months exposure in significant currencies we generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

item 2—properties 

we own and lease a number of properties for use as offices throughout the world and believe that our properties are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used the principal properties are located in the united kingdom and the united states our principal office at ten trinity square in london is a landmark building which we own in november 2004 we entered into an agreement for lease with longtime client british land plc relating to our new uk headquarters in 

london construction is scheduled to commence in early 2005 and willis occupancy is targeted for late 2007 













 item 3—legal proceedings 

general we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business similar to other corporations we are also subject to a variety of other claims including those relating to our employment practices some of those claims lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could if assessed be significant most of the claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance in respect of selfinsured deductibles we have established provisions against these items which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments on the basis of current information we do not expect that the actual claims lawsuits and other proceedings to which we are subject or potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating to matters discussed below will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity nonetheless given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions and the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could from time to time have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 

the most significant actual or potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings of which we are currently aware are 

sovereignwfum sovereign a wholly owned subsidiary of ours operated as an insurance company in the united kingdom and from 1972 sovereigns underwriting activities were managed by another wholly owned subsidiary of ours willis faber underwriting management limited or wfum wfum also provided underwriting agency and other services to thirdparty insurance companies which we refer to as the stamp companies some of which are longstanding clients of ours as part of its services as agent wfum arranged insurance and reinsurance business on behalf of sovereign and the stamp companies and arranged reinsurance on their behalf in 1991 sovereign and the stamp companies ceased underwriting new business sovereign entered provisional liquidation in 1997 

on january 5 2000 a scheme of arrangement proposed by sovereign to its creditors became effective the stated purpose of the scheme of arrangement is to resolve sovereigns liabilities and provide that sovereigns business is run off in as orderly a manner as possible the scheme administrators have announced payments to creditors at a payment percentage of 40 payable out of sovereigns assets sovereigns assets are separate and distinct from ours and any payment from sovereign will have no effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

sovereign and certain of the stamp companies have also expressed concern about the enforceability of certain reinsurance put in place by wfum on behalf of sovereign and the stamp companies accordingly we cannot assure you that there will be no arbitration judicial decisions or settlements arising in the future that result in shortfalls in reinsurance recoveries for sovereign or the stamp companies the failure of sovereign or the stamp companies to collect reinsurance following any adverse arbitration awards would increase the likelihood of them pursuing claims against wfum 

sovereign and the stamp companies have reserved their rights generally in respect of such potential claims and wfum willis group and certain of our brokerage subsidiaries have entered into standstill agreements which preserve the rights of potential claimants with respect to their potential claims 

in 2004 the solvent stamp companies entered into a settlement agreement whereby willis group limited and all its subsidiaries received certain immediate releases and other releases staged in return for certain staged payments the full details of the agreement are confidential but once the final staged 

payment is made willis and its subsidiaries will be released from further potential liabilities to the stamp companies arising out of the wfum pools meanwhile there remains the possibility that new matters may arise and the later staged releases will not become activated although we are not aware of any current reason why that might occur 

world trade center we acted as the insurance broker but not as an underwriter for the placement of both property and casualty insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted by the september 11 2001 destruction of the world trade center complex including silverstein properties llc which acquired a 99year leasehold interest in the twin towers and related facilities from the port authority of new york and new jersey in july 2001 although the world trade center complex insurance was bound at or before the july 2001 closing of the leasehold acquisition consistent with standard industry practice the final policy wording for the placements was still in the process of being finalized when the twin towers and other buildings in the complex were destroyed on september 11 2001 there are a number of lawsuits pending in the united states between the insured parties and the insurers for several placements including the silverstein property placement but we are not a party to any of these lawsuits the principal issue in dispute in the silverstein property litigation is whether the september 11 events constituted one or more occurrences for the purposes of the relevant insurance policies and the outcome of this issue will significantly impact the amount that the insurers ultimately pay on the property policies other disputes may also arise in respect of the world trade center insurance placed by us which could affect the company including claims by one or more of the insureds that we made culpable errors or omissions in connection with our brokerage activities however we do not believe that our role as broker will lead to liabilities which in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

contingent compensation arrangements beginning in april 2004 the new york attorney general issued subpoenas to a number of insurance carriers and insurance broking firms including the company these subpoenas requested information regarding among other things arrangements pursuant to which insurers compensated insurance brokers for distribution and other services provided to insurers the new york department of insurance also requested information concerning these compensation arrangements in october 2004 the new york attorney general filed suit against one of the insurance brokers accusing that broker of steering clients to insurers with which it has these compensation arrangements and of soliciting false or fictitious quotes from insurers the ny ag complaint the new york attorney general has stated publicly that he has broadened his investigation of the insurance industry to cover other practices and other possible violations of law including violations of fiduciary duty securities laws and antitrust laws the new york attorney general has also publicly stated that civil and criminal charges may be filed against both individuals and other industry participants after the new york attorney general commenced his investigation insurance commissioners and attorneys general of other states announced that they are conducting similar investigations and have issued subpoenas to a number of insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms including the company the company has received requests for documents and information from eighteen other states and the district of columbia the company is cooperating fully with these investigations and is producing documents and other information in response to these subpoenas the company has engaged in discussions with representatives of the new york attorney generals office and of other states insurance commissioners and attorneys general about their investigations the company cannot predict at this time how or when those investigations will be resolved 

in august 2004 a state court proceeding was commenced against the company in california by an organization purporting to act in a representative capacity on behalf of the california general public the complaint alleges that the compensation arrangements between the company and insurance carriers constitute deceptive trade practices and it seeks both injunctive and equitable relief including restitution this action was dismissed in december 2004 a purported class action also was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york naming various insurance carriers 

and insurance brokerage firms including the company as defendants the complaint alleges conduct by the defendants similar to the conduct alleged in the ny ag complaint and also alleges among other things the existence of a conspiracy among the insurance carriers and brokers whereby they have engaged in violations of the federal rico statute similar purported class actions also have been filed against various insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms including the company in the united states district courts for the northern district of illinois and the northern district of california and in the florida state court and it is expected that further lawsuits may be filed the actions filed in federal court will be transferred to the united states district court for the district of new jersey for coordinated pretrial proceedings the company disputes these allegations and intends to defend itself vigorously against these actions 

the compensation arrangements which were initially the subject of the investigation by the new york attorney general are a longstanding and general practice within the insurance industry and have been disclosed by the company for many years on october 21 2004 the company announced that it was voluntarily abolishing these compensation arrangements immediately in north america and by december 31 2004 outside north america it is not possible at this time to predict what the outcome or the timing of any resolution of these proceedings or any possible future proceedings may be 

insurance market dispute various legal proceedings are pending have been concluded or may commence between reinsurers reinsureds and in some cases their intermediaries including reinsurance brokers relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance for the years 1993 to 1998 the proceedings principally concern allegations by reinsurers that they have sustained substantial losses due to an alleged abnormal spiral in the market in which the reinsurance contracts were placed the existence and nature of which as well as other information was not disclosed to them by the reinsureds or their reinsurance broker a spiral is a market term for a situation in which reinsureds and reinsurers reinsure each other with the effect that the same loss or portion of that loss moves through the market multiple times 

the reinsurers concerned have taken the position that despite their decisions to underwrite risks or a group of risks they are no longer bound by their reinsurance contracts as a result they have stopped settling claims and are seeking to recover claims already paid we acted as the reinsurance broker or otherwise as intermediary but not as an underwriter for numerous personal accident reinsurance contracts including for two contracts that were involved in one of the arbitrations due to the small number of reinsurance brokers generally we were one of a small number of brokers active in the market for this reinsurance during the relevant period we also utilized other brokers active in this market as subagents including brokers who are parties to the legal proceedings described above for certain contracts and may be responsible for any errors and omissions they may have made in july 2003 one of the reinsurers received a judgment in the english high court against certain parties including a subbroker we used to place two of the contracts involved in this trial although neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were a party to this or any other proceeding or arbitration we entered into standstill agreements with certain of the principals to the reinsurance contracts tolling the statute of limitations pending the outcome of proceedings between the reinsureds and reinsurers 

although at this time no claims are pending against us and we have not joined any settlement effort claims may be made against us if reinsurers do not pay claims on policies issued by them it is too early to know what amount of underwriting losses will be alleged to be attributable to an abnormal spiral or the other issues that may be raised or what amount if any reinsureds or reinsurers or other intermediaries may seek to recover from us 

pender insurance limitedcaptive insurance management legal proceedings have been commenced in the english commercial court by cable  wireless plc and pender insurance limited its captive insurer against six of their former employees and certain other individuals and entities and more recently two of our subsidiaries and one of our former employees we acted through one of our subsidiaries as an independent captive manager for pender from 1990 to 2003 the plaintiffs allege a 

fraudulent conspiracy involving the manner in which pender was managed operated or advised by the defendants which allegedly resulted in substantial damages to the plaintiffs and in a second claim negligence with respect to certain reinsurance policies we intend to defend ourselves vigorously at the trial which is scheduled to commence in october 2005 we are unable at this time to ascertain the total amount of damages suffered by the claimants or what portion if any of those damages the court might ultimately determine to be the responsibility of the willis defendants

executive summary 

2004 was a challenging year for the insurance industry rates declined as the market softened and regulatory investigations in particular by the new york attorney general led to a reassessment of market practices 

results and dividend 

against this background we reported a 10 percent increase in revenues of which 2 percent was attributable to the net impact of foreign currency translation and 4 percent to acquisitions and disposals organic revenue growth of 4 percent reflected net new business growth of 6 percent offset by a negative 2 percent impact from declining insurance premium rates 

our operating margin operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 29 percent in 2004 from 30 percent in 2003 reflecting the impact of higher expenses related to legal investigative and regulatory compliance and incremental salaries and benefits expense for recruiting and retention 

net income at 427 million in 2004 was 13 million or 3 percent higher than 2003 and net income per diluted share increased by 4 percent to 254 from 245 in 2003 

the board has approved a 15 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 086 per share annually with effect from april 2005 

cash and financing 

cash generated from operations was 490 million which together with an 80 million increase in our longterm borrowings and other smaller cash inflows was used to support our share buyback program 339 million dividends 115 million and acquisitions 147 million 

in february 2004 we redeemed all 370 million of the outstanding 9 senior subordinated notes and at the same time drew down 300 million of a new 600 million credit facility a further 150 million was drawn down in june 2004 in accordance with our credit facility arrangements we have now repaid or refinanced all the debt relating to our 1998 leveraged buyout 

acquisitions 

during the year we completed several acquisitions with annualized revenues of approximately 155 million at a total cost of 195 million including shares issued acquisitions included coyle hamilton the republic of irelands largest privately owned insurance broker ch jeffries and opus in the united kingdom which strengthened our middle market and large account capabilities and a controlling interest in willis as denmark 

impact of abolishing volume and profitbased contingent commissions and future outlook 

in october 2004 we announced that we were abolishing volume and profitbased contingent commissions in north america we discontinued these commissions as of october 21 2004 and in other markets where we operate we unwound these commission arrangements by december 31 2004 globally we earned 71 million from volume and profitbased contingent commissions in 2004 and 70 million in 2003 we do not expect to earn any of these contingent commissions in 2005 and future years although immaterial amounts may be received in relation to the windingup of contracts from prior years 

in addition to volume and profitbased contingent commissions we earned market service and other fees in 2004 of 77 million compared to 63 million in 2003 this market derived income includes fees received for product and market research and development we carry out on behalf of insurers and 

income related to administration and other services we provide to the market we are working with the market to restructure these contracts which may impact the level of fees earned 

however in the rapidly changing industry environment we see new opportunities to enhance our global market share especially with middle market and large accounts our efforts to grow market share will include increased marketing aggressive targeting of new accounts an emphasis on retaining existing accounts crossselling and continued hiring of new business producers and other staff in addition we continue to look for acquisition opportunities globally and we expect the pace of acquisitions will continue at the rate we experienced in 2004 

disposal of stewart smith 

on february 15 2005 we announced an agreement in principle to sell our wholesale unit stewart smith this disposal is part of our overall strategy of focusing on our core broking operations and divesting noncore business interests stewart smith contributed 77 million of revenues in 2004 

critical accounting estimates 

the companys accounting policies are described in note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of the companys financial condition or operating performance 

pension expense 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all our employees in the united states and united kingdom elsewhere pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans the key assumptions in determining pension expense for the defined benefit plans are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the expected longterm rate of compensation increase and the discount rate applicable to the plan liabilities 

the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets were developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations the expected longterm rates of return used for determining the net pension expense in 2004 were 725 percent for the uk plan unchanged from 2003 and 80 percent for the us plan a reduction of 05 percent from the rate used in 2003 a 025 percent change in the longterm rate of return for both plans would impact 2005 net pension expense by approximately 5 million 

the rates used to discount pension plan liabilities at december 31 2004 were based on the yields prevailing at that date of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity the selected discount rates were 53 percent a reduction of 02 percent from 2003 for the uk plan liabilities and 575 percent a reduction of 025 percent from 2003 for the us plan liabilities a 025 percent change in the discount rate for both plans would in the absence of any other factors impact 2005 net pension expense by approximately 10 million 

net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans in 2004 was 28 million an increase of 10 million compared with 2003 arising mainly from lower discount rates and increased longevity we expect our net pension expense in 2005 will increase by approximately 25 million over 2004 reflecting a further fall in discount rates and a further increase in longevity as well as higher amortization charges for losses arising in prior years 

deferred tax 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards we 

estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies 

at december 31 2004 the company had gross deferred tax assets of 377 million 2003 308 million against which a valuation allowance of 123 million 2003 114 million had been recognized to the extent that the actual future taxable income in the periods during which the temporary differences are expected to reverse differs from current projections or assumed prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to materialize or new tax planning strategies are developed or material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry forward time limits the company may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income although management does not believe that this is likely 

commitments contingencies and accrued liabilities 

the company has established provisions against various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported these provisions are established based on advice received from qualified professionals including external legal advisors and are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions including historical claims experience a significant increase in the frequency or severity of claims for errors and omissions could have a material effect on the companys results of operations 

as a consequence of the increasing cost of purchasing professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims we raised our selfinsured retentions in 2004 and reduced the amount of coverage purchased from our insurers accordingly our provisions for claims at december 31 2004 including provisions for claims incurred but not reported reflect the higher level of risk being retained 

there was no significant impact on our operating results in 2004 when compared to 2003 from all expenses associated with these issues insurance premiums payable claims paid and insurance recoveries received together with adjustments to provisions held 

accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r sfas 123r replaces sfas 123 and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 sfas 123r requires that the cost resulting from all sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at fair value and that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid sfas 123r is effective for the company from july 1 2005 

sfas 123r permits public companies to account for sharebased payments using one of two methods modifiedprospective method or modifiedretrospective method under the modifiedprospective method from the effective date compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of sfas 123r for all new sharebased awards and based on the requirements of sfas 123 for all awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas 123r that remain unvested on the effective date 

the requirements of the modifiedretrospective method are as above with the exception that companies are permitted to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas 123 for pro forma disclosure purposes either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods in the year of adoption 

the sfas 123 pro forma disclosures given in note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements show the impact of the company adopting sfas 123r in prior periods the company has not yet determined which transition method to use 

business and market overview 

we provide a broad range of insurance brokerage and risk management consulting services to our worldwide clients in our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements assisting clients to determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network 

we generate revenue from commissions and fees on insurance placements and fees from consulting and other services we also earn interest on premiums held before remittance to the insurer and on claims held before payment to the insured 

the majority of our revenue is commission based and varies based upon the premiums on the policies we place on behalf of our clients as such when premium rates in the insurance market rise we tend to benefit and when premium rates decline we tend to experience pressure on our revenues although in both cases there are many conflicting factors including changes in buying and selling behavior we manage expenses to moderate the impact on earnings 

from the late 1980s through late 2000 insurance premium rates generally trended downwards as a result of a number of factors however following several years of underwriting losses the declines in world equity markets and lower interest rates many insurance carriers began to increase premium rates in 2000 the tragic events of september 11 2001 acted as a catalyst especially in areas such as aerospace and rates generally continued to rise through 2003 

during 2004 we have seen a rapid transition from a hard market with premium rates stable or increasing to a soft market with premium rates falling in most markets premium rates had a neutral impact on revenue growth in the first quarter 2004 but by the fourth quarter there was a negative 4 percent year on year impact in the property and casualty market rates have fallen between 10 to 30 percent falling sharply in the third quarter and continuing to fall in the fourth quarter however conditions were not uniform across all classes of business in some areas premium rates have stabilized and certain market segments may begin to see rate increases overall we expect the soft market to continue in 2005 

operating results 

revenues 

2004 compared with 2003 

during 2004 all our businesses reported growth in their 2004 revenues compared with 2003 despite the declining rate environment 

our international business earns revenues in currencies other than the us dollar in 2004 reported revenues in our international division benefited significantly from the impact of foreign currency translation largely as a result of the euro strengthening against the dollar this benefit was partly offset by the strength of the dollar relative to latin american currencies throughout 2004 

net acquisitions and disposals led to a 14 percent increase in internationals 2004 revenues compared with the prior year the increase was mainly attributable to the acquisition of a controlling interest in willis as our danish subsidiary which was consolidated from january 1 2004 

organic revenue growth in 2004 was 4 percent comprised of approximately 6 percent net new business growth partly offset by a 2 percent reduction due to declining insurance premium rates the following table sets out revenue growth by business 

 i organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions and disposals from reported revenues we use organic growth as a measure of business growth generated by operations that were part of the group at the end of the period our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited ii following a change to our reporting structure effective july 1 2004 72 million of revenues previously reported as north america for the year ended december 31 2003 have been reclassified as global revenues global organic revenue growth in our global business of 3 percent reflected good performances by most business units despite noticeable downward pressure on premium rates global markets grew by 5 percent reflecting new business activity particularly within the international and financial and professional risk operations global specialties revenue grew marginally in 2004 with new business activity largely offset by the impact of falling rates and lower volume and profitbased contingent commissions reinsurance revenues grew in 2004 due to a strong new business performance particularly from the us reinsurance unit premium rates were a negative factor on reinsurance revenues from the second quarter of 2004 and for full year 2004 had an adverse impact of 3 percent when compared with 2003 in addition reinsurance brokerage was adversely affected by increased self insurance by clients 

north america organic revenue growth in our north america business was 3 percent in 2004 despite the elimination of volume and profitbased contingent commissions in the fourth quarter and a softening insurance market place as we moved through 2004 declining premium rates had an increasingly negative effect 

in 2004 revenues included 27 million of volume and profitbased contingent commissions due to the abolition of these commissions in october 2004 there were no volume and profitbased contingent commissions in the fourth quarter 2004 in 2003 revenues included 30 million of volume and profitbased contingent commissions of which 10 million was recognized in the fourth quarter 

international organic revenue growth in our international business of 9 percent in 2004 was driven by good performances in europe notably the netherlands and iberia asia and latin america there was a modest negative impact from premium rates on average although the effect varied by country and by line of business 

2003 compared with 2002 

total revenues increased by 20 percent to 2076 million in 2003 reported revenues included a 6 percent benefit due to the impact of foreign currency translation largely due to the strengthening of both the euro and sterling against the dollar 

net acquisitions and disposals mainly reflecting the disposal of thirdparty administration units in north america in 2002 had a small negative impact on revenue growth 

we estimate that organic revenue growth of 15 percent in 2003 comprised approximately 12 percent due to net new business growth and approximately 3 percent from the impact of higher premium rates 

 i organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions and disposals from reported revenues we use organic growth as a measure of business growth generated by operations that were part of the group at the end of the period ii following a change to our reporting structure effective july 1 2004 revenues of 72 million previously reported as north america for the year ended december 31 2003 and 59 million for the year ended december 31 2002 have been reclassified as global revenues global all business units contributed to organic revenue growth of 17 percent and continued to work closely with north america and international business units to leverage ukbased capabilities and resources throughout the distribution network 

north america organic revenue growth of 13 percent in 2003 was mainly attributable to solid contributions from our middle market large account and specialty practices notably executive risk employee benefits and construction through new business development and recruitment 

international organic revenue growth of 15 percent in 2003 was led by good performances in continental europe notably italy and iberia latin america australia and south africa many new business wins were the result of teamwork with global markets and global specialties 

general and administrative expenses 

 2004 compared with 2003 

general and administrative expenses including noncash compensation charges at 1573 million in 2004 were 145 million or 10 percent higher than in 2003 

the noncash compensation charge for performancebased stock options in 2004 was 11 million as of december 31 2004 we have recognized 100 percent of the 270 million noncash compensation charge for performancebased stock options granted to management as part of the 1998 leveraged buyout arrangement for meeting or exceeding 2001 and 2002 targets 

excluding noncash compensation charges for performancebased stock options there was an underlying increase of 154 million or 11 percent of which 2 percent was attributable to foreign currency translation and 4 percent to acquisitions and disposals 

salaries and benefits excluding noncash compensation charges for performancebased stock options were 52 percent of revenues in 2004 compared to 50 percent of revenues in 2003 reflecting increased expenditure on recruitment and retention of staff we have been recruiting steadily over the last three years as the company has grown and we continue to build the sales culture the pace of this recruitment accelerated in the fourth quarter and at december 31 2004 the number of revenue earning staff was 5 percent higher than a year ago in 2005 the ratio of salary and benefits to revenues may increase slightly depending in particular on our chosen rate of hiring new staff 

other expenses included some 10 million of incremental legal investigative and other costs incurred in fourth quarter 2004 primarily relating to the new york attorney generals investigation we expect this and other compliance expenditure such as sarbanesoxley to continue into 2005 but at a lower level 

2003 compared with 2002 

general and administrative expenses were 1428 million in 2003 compared with 1294 million in 2002 

noncash compensation charges for performancebased stock options were 20 million in 2003 compared with 80 million in 2002 these performancebased stock options are accounted for under the variable plan method with the charges based on the difference between the price of our stock at the end of the performance period december 31 2002 and the exercise price spread in accordance with the vesting schedule the higher charge in 2002 reflected both an increase in the total estimated charge as a result of increases in our stock price up to the end of the performance period and a higher number of unvested options outstanding during 2002 than during 2003 

excluding the noncash compensation charge for performancebased stock options general and administrative expenses were 16 percent higher in 2003 than in 2002 approximately 6 percent of this increase was attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation and approximately 3 percent was attributable to the effect of acquisitions and disposals 

excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions and disposals general and administrative expenses grew by 13 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 most of this increase was attributable to salaries and benefits including incentivebased compensation and reflects the increased number of employees salaries and benefits including incentivebased compensation amounted to 50 percent of revenues in 2003 the same proportion as in 2002 

operating income and operating margin 

 we earn revenue in an uneven fashion during the year primarily due to the timing of insurance policy renewals as many policies incept and renew as of december 31 or january 1 we generate the majority of our revenues in the first and fourth calendar quarters general and administrative expenses however are incurred on a relatively even basis throughout the year as a result we have historically earned the majority of our operating income in the first and fourth quarters operating income in 2004 was 234 million 153 million 109 million and 170 million for the first second third and fourth 

quarters respectively volume and profitbased contingent commissions contributed 21 million 15 million 10 million and 25 million respectively to operating income by quarter 

operating margin or operating income as a percentage of revenues was 293 percent in 2004 compared with 299 percent in 2003 and 241 percent in 2002 an 80 million noncash compensation charge for performancebased stock options significantly impacted operating margin in 2002 excluding noncash compensation charges and the net impact of acquisitions and disposals from all years operating margin was 293 percent in 2004 303 percent in 2003 and 280 percent in 2002 the decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 reflects the increase in recruitment and retention costs and higher legal regulatory and compliance expenses 

premium on redemption of subordinated notes 

in february 2004 we paid a call premium of 17 million on the early redemption of all 370 million of our 9 senior subordinated notes 

interest expense 

interest expense in 2004 was 22 million significantly lower than in 2003 53 million and 2002 65 million this decrease reflects the benefit of lower average levels of debt together with lower interest rates on our new credit facilities 

income taxes 

 income tax expense for 2004 amounted to 208 million an effective rate of 33 percent the effects on taxation of the amortization of intangible assets disposals of operations and performancebased stock options had a net neutral impact on the 2004 tax rate 

income tax expense for 2003 amounted to 159 million an effective rate of 28 percent in the third quarter of 2003 certain changes to uk tax legislation were enacted regarding the taxation of employee stock options with effect from july 1 2003 we obtain a corporate tax deduction equal to the market price of our shares on the date of exercise less the option exercise price paid by the employee noncash compensation amounting to 116 million in respect of uk performance options had been expensed in periods prior to january 1 2003 without any income tax benefit being recognized accordingly following the change in uk tax legislation a onetime income tax benefit of 35 million and a corresponding deferred asset was recognized in 2003 

adjusting for the onetime income tax benefit arising from the change in uk tax legislation that part of the noncash performance option charge which is not tax deductible and the net gain on disposal of operations the underlying tax rate for 2003 was 34 percent 

income tax expense for 2002 amounted to 141 million an effective rate of 40 percent adjusting for the noncash compensation charge for performance options for which approximately 60 percent of the total charge was nondeductible and acquisitions and disposals the underlying tax rate for 2002 was 35 percent 

net income and earnings per share 

 net income for all years was impacted by noncash charges for performance options and net gains on disposal of operations in addition 2004 was adversely impacted by a call premium paid on the early redemption of the 9 senior subordinated notes 10 million net of tax while 2003 benefited from a onetime tax benefit of 35 million following a change to uk tax legislation regarding the taxation of employee stock options 

excluding these items net income increased by 13 percent to 437 million in 2004 260 per diluted share and by 43 percent to 386 million in 2003 228 per diluted share from 270 million in 2002 162 per diluted share there was no impact of foreign currency translation on earnings in 2004 compared with 2003 and an approximate 007 per share benefit to 2003 earnings compared with 2002 

the average number of diluted shares outstanding for the year was 168 million as calculated under the treasury stock method 

liquidity and capital resources 

on february 2 2004 we redeemed all the 370 million then outstanding of our 9 senior subordinated notes to finance the repayment we drew down 300 million of bank loans under our senior credit facility with the remaining balance of 70 million and call premium of 17 million being financed using cash from operations on june 1 2004 we drew down the remaining 150 million of bank loans in accordance with our credit facility arrangements 

during 2004 we began a program of share buybacks total repurchases under the program at december 31 2004 were 93 million shares of common stock at a cost of 339 million out of the companys authorization limit of 500 million buyback activity in fourth quarter 2004 was modest at 03 million shares for 12 million 

operating activities 

as an intermediary we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers we report premiums which are held on account of or due from clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers claims held by or due to us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities all these balances due or payable are included in accounts receivable and accounts payable on the balance sheet we earn interest on these funds during the time between the receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid out fiduciary cash must be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which generally emphasize capital preservation and liquidity and is not generally available to service our debt or for other corporate purposes 

we became subject to new regulations in the united kingdom in january 2005 regarding fiduciary funds held by insurance intermediaries these regulations require fiduciary funds to be held in designated trust accounts restrict the financial instruments in which such funds may be invested and affect the timing of transferring commissions from fiduciary funds to own funds 

the new regulations change the basis for the withdrawal of commissions from fiduciary funds from an earned to a receipts basis with a consequential increase in the balances held in fiduciary funds as a 

result on january 15 2005 the date the new regulations came into force in the united kingdom fiduciary funds were increased by 134 million with a corresponding decrease in own funds on a fullyear basis we do not expect these regulations to have any further significant impact on the cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operations which excludes fiduciary cash movements was 490 million in 2004 having increased to 493 million in 2003 from 343 million in 2002 net cash provided by operations was flat in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the impact of recruitment and retention strategies employed by the group at the end of 2004 and higher expenses related to legal investigative and regulatory compliance the increase in 2003 compared with 2002 was due mainly to increasing revenue and widening operating margins over that period 

net cash in 2005 will be adversely impacted by the abolition of volume and profitbased contingent commissions however we expect to mitigate this impact by the steps we are taking to grow our market share and by continuing to control expenses tightly 

investing activities 

total net cash used in investing activities increased to 183 million in 2004 from 135 million in 2003 and 50 million in 2002 

we stepped up the pace of acquisitions in 2004 as part of our growth strategy to secure leadership positions in key markets and strengthen our middle and large market capabilities we used 147 million net of cash acquired primarily for the acquisitions of coyle hamilton the republic of irelands largest privately owned insurance broker the controlling interest in willis as denmarks largest insurance broker two reinsurance brokers in italy and denmark and opus a regional insurance broking business in the united kingdom 

cash used for acquisitions in 2003 amounted to 91 million net of cash acquired primarily incurred in acquiring further interests in willis gmbh willis iberia and willis italia as we continued our policy of acquiring controlling interests in most major associate companies and other remaining minority interests cash used for acquisitions in 2002 amounted to 13 million net of cash acquired primarily incurred in acquiring richard n goldman and further interests in willis gmbh 

we have historically funded acquisitions with cash or a combination of cash and equity depending on the acquisition and the economics of the transaction we would expect this pattern to continue 

capital expenditures for 2004 2003 and 2002 were 49 million 57 million and 47 million respectively we have funded our requirements for capital expenditures by cash generated internally from operations and expect to continue to do so in the future 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities amounted to 333 million in 2004 compared with 222 million in 2003 and 218 million in 2002 in december 2003 we replaced our existing senior credit facilities with a new 600 million facility consisting of a 450 million amortizing fiveyear term loan and a 150 million revolving credit facility these new facilities are unsecured both the term loan and the revolving credit facility now bear interest at a rate of libor plus 85 basis points reduced from 95 basis points prior to december 4 2004 subject to adjustment based on future changes in interest coverage leverage and credit ratings on june 4 2004 the company entered into a series of interest swap agreements in order to fix our interest payment obligations until 2006 

on february 2 2004 we redeemed all the 370 million then outstanding of 9 senior subordinated notes to finance the repayment we drew down 300 million of our new term loan facility with the remaining balance of 70 million and call premium of 17 million being financed using cash from operations 

during 2003 debt repayments amounted to 198 million following repayments of 221 million in 2002 

during 2004 we began a program of share buybacks repurchasing and subsequently canceling 9288100 shares of common stock at a cost of 339 million on september 8 2004 the board of directors approved an increase in the authorization limit of the program to 500 million 

in february 2003 we declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of 0125 per share this was increased in july 2003 by 30 percent to 01625 per share an annual rate of 065 per share the cash dividends paid during 2003 amounted to 63 million the quarterly cash dividend was increased in february 2004 by a further 15 percent to 01875 per share an annual rate of 075 per share the cash dividends paid during 2004 amounted to 115 million in february 2005 the quarterly cash dividend was increased by a further 15 percent to 0215 per share an annual rate of 086 per share at this rate the expected annual cost of dividends payable in 2005 will be approximately 138 million we have funded dividends from cash generated internally by operations and expect to continue to do so in the future 

as of december 31 2004 we had cash and cash equivalents of 351 million down from 364 million at december 31 2003 we expect that internally generated funds will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable operating cash requirements capital expenditures and dividend payments in addition we have an undrawn 150 million revolving credit facility 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations at december 31 2004 were 

 1 based on the earliest dates on which options could be exercised under the terms of the senior credit facility 150 million of the term loans mature in each of december 2006 december 2007 and december 2008 

in november 2004 we entered into a 25 year agreement with british land plc relating to our new uk headquarters in london construction is scheduled to commence in early 2005 and our occupancy is targeted for late 2007 our contractual obligations in relation to this commitment totalling 893 million are included in the table above but are contingent upon the successful completion of construction 

in connection with many of our investments in less than whollyowned subsidiaries and associates we retain rights to increase our ownership percentage over time typically to a majority or 100 percent ownership position in addition in certain instances the other owners have a right typically at a price calculated pursuant to a formula based on revenues or earnings to put some or all of their shares to us 

as part of our acquisition of 33 percent of gras savoye we entered into a put arrangement whereby the other shareholders in gras savoye primarily two families two insurance companies and gras savoyes executive management team could put their shares to us until 2011 we will be 

obligated to buy the shares of certain shareholders to the extent those shareholders put their shares potentially increasing our ownership from 33 percent to 90 percent if all shareholders put their shares at a price determined by a contractual formula based on earnings and revenue management shareholders of gras savoye representing approximately 10 percent of shares do not have general put rights before 2011 but have certain put rights on their death disability or retirement from which payments at december 31 2004 based on the formula would not have exceeded 65 million during 2005 the incremental 57 percent of gras savoye may be put to us at a price equal to the greater of approximately 800 million french francs 166 million at december 31 2004 exchange rates or a price based on the formula which at december 31 2004 amounted to approximately 368 million from 2006 the put price is determined solely by the formula the shareholders may put their shares individually at any time during the put period 

while neither we nor the management of gras savoye expect significant exercises of the puts on a separate or aggregate basis in the near to medium term we nevertheless believe that should the aggregate amount of shares be put to us sufficient funds would be available to satisfy this obligation in addition we have a call option to move to majority ownership under certain circumstances and in any event by 2009 upon exercising this call option the remaining gras savoye shareholders have a put option

we report our operating results and financial condition in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in the united kingdom however we earn revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling outside the united states and the united kingdom we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency the table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2004 

 37 

our operations are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from cash flows and financial instruments that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our primary foreign exchange risk arises from changes in the exchange rates between us dollars and pounds sterling our objective is to maximize our cash flow in us dollars our policy is to convert into pounds sterling all revenue arising in currencies other than us dollars together with sufficient us dollar revenues to fund the remaining pound sterling expenses outside the united kingdom only those cash flows necessary to fund mismatches between revenues and expenses are converted into local currency amounts remitted to the united kingdom are generally converted into pounds sterling these transactional currency exposures are generally managed by entering into forward exchange contracts it is our policy to hedge at least 25 percent of the next 12 months exposure in significant currencies we do not generally hedge exposures beyond three years 

the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts which are sensitive to exchange rate risk the table summarizes the us dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates all forward exchange contracts mature within three years 

  1 represents the difference between the contract amount and the cash flow in us dollars which would have been receivable had the foreign currency forward exchange contracts been entered into on december 31 2004 or 2003 at the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date interest rate risk management 

we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing and investing activities our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in shortterm interest rates in both us dollars and pounds sterling 

our operations are financed principally by variable rate bank borrowings issued by a subsidiary this debt amortises evenly over three years beginning december 4 2006 our policy is to minimise our exposure to increases in the interest rates on our variable rate borrowings accordingly our exposure to rising interest rates is fully hedged up to the time of the first debt amortisation 

as a consequence of our insurance and reinsurance broking activities there is a delay between the time we receive cash for premiums and claims and the time the cash needs to be paid we earn interest on this float which is included in our consolidated financial statements as interest income this float is regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which it may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity we manage the interest rate risk arising from this exposure primarily through the use of interest rate swaps it is our policy that for currencies with significant balances a minimum of 25 percent of forecast income arising is hedged for each of the next three years 

the table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest for interest rate swaps the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts the duration of interest rate swaps varies between one and four years with an average refixing period of three months average fixed and variable rates are respectively the weightedaverage actual and market rates for the interest hedges in place market rates are the rates prevailing at december 31 2004 or 2003 as appropriate

  cash and cash equivalents —cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of time deposits and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less 

  fiduciary funds—restricted —fiduciary fundsrestricted represent unremitted premiums received from insureds and unremitted claims received from insurers fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity such funds are not available to service the companys debt or for other corporate purposes notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers the company is entitled to retain interest income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and in some cases as supported by agreements with insureds

  fixed assets —fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation expenditures for improvements are capitalized repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred depreciation is computed using the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of assets 

depreciation on buildings and long leaseholds is calculated over 50 years depreciation on leasehold improvements is calculated over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or the lease term depreciation on furniture and equipment is calculated based on a range of 3 to 25 years 

the components of fixed assets are as follows 

   recoverability of fixed assets —in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  longlived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets held and used by a company are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in performing the review for recoverability the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the undiscounted future cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset the asset is deemed impaired the amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset generally longlived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

  goodwill and other intangible assets —goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable as part of the evaluation the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the underlying business operation are compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if a writedown is required if such an assessment indicates that the undiscounted future cash flows will not be recovered the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated fair value acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful life 

  investments in associates —investments in entities less than 50 owned in which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method of accounting whereby the investment is carried at cost of acquisition plus the companys equity in undistributed net income since acquisition less dividends received investments in entities less than 20 owned are accounted for by the cost method such investments are not publicly traded the company periodically reviews its investments in associates for which fair value is less than cost to determine if the decline in value is other than temporary if the decline in value is judged to be other than temporary the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value the amount of any writedown is included in the statement of operations as a realized loss 

  put and call options relating to subsidiaries and associates — for certain subsidiaries and associates the company has the right to purchase shares a call option from coshareholders at various dates in the future in addition the coshareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell their shares a put option to the company at various dates in the future generally the exercise price 

of such puts and calls is formulabased using revenues and earnings and is designed to reflect fair value on inception of an option agreement the company records the puts and calls at fair value the put and call options are subsequently marked to market at each reporting period with changes in value being recognized in the statements of operations 

  derivative financial instruments —the company uses derivative financial instruments for other than trading purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure interest rate swaps are used to manage interest risk exposures forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to manage currency exposures arising from future income the fair values of derivative contracts are recorded in other assets and other liabilities with changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting recorded in other comprehensive income and changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting recorded in general and administrative expenses amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings 

  income taxes —the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas 109 sfas 109 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the enactment date changes deferred tax assets and liabilities are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as based on available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

  pensions —the company accounts for pension expense in accordance with sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions  pension information is presented in accordance with sfas no 132 revised 2003 employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits

interest income is recognized as earned 

  accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements —in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r sfas 123r replaces sfas 123 and supersedes apb 25 sfas 123r requires that the cost resulting from all sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at fair value and that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid sfas 123r is effective for the company from july 1 2005 

sfas 123r permits public companies to account for sharebased payments using one of two methods modifiedprospective method or modifiedretrospective method under the modifiedprospective method from the effective date compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of sfas 123r for all new sharebased awards and based on the requirements of sfas 123 for all awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas 123r that remain unvested on the effective date 

the requirements of the modifiedretrospective method are as above with the exception that companies are permitted to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas 123 for pro forma disclosure purposes either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods in the year of adoption

during 2003 and 2002 the company acquired or increased its investments in a number of other businesses the aggregate purchase price of all acquisitions completed in 2003 and 2002 approximated 94 million and 32 million respectively inclusive of deferred payments amounting to 4 million and shares of 12 million in 2003 and deferred payments amounting to 9 million in 2002 

all of these transactions were recorded using the purchase method of accounting accordingly the results of the acquired businesses and the companys increased share of the undistributed net income of associates have been included in the companys consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates the assets and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values pro forma results from these acquisitions would not have been materially different from the amounts reported 

goodwill and other intangible assets recognized on these transactions amounted to 212 million 2003 87 million of which 3 million 2003 27 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes additional consideration of up to 40 million 2003 11 million is payable in future periods contingent on the results of the acquired businesses reaching specified thresholds 

  dispositions —total proceeds relating to 2004 dispositions of subsidiaries and associates amounted to 10 million inclusive of deferred proceeds amounting to 2 million with a gain of 11 million recorded in the consolidated statement of operations

in 2002 the company completed the sale of its life and health thirdparty administration business the gain on disposal of 14 million included a goodwill write off of 3 million and has been recorded in the statement of operations total proceeds relating to other disposals in 2002 were not material 

4 income taxes 

the components of income before income taxes equity in net income of associates and minority interest are as follows 

 the provision for income taxes by location of the taxing jurisdiction consisted of the following 

 1 in 2003 certain changes to uk tax legislation were enacted regarding the taxation of employee stock options when ukbased employees exercise their stock options the company now obtains a corporate tax deduction equal to the market price of the companys shares on the date of exercise less the option exercise price paid by the employee noncash compensation amounting to 116 million in respect of uk performance options was expensed in periods prior to january 1 2003 without any income tax benefit being recognized accordingly following the change in uk tax legislation an income tax benefit of 35 million and a corresponding deferred asset was recognized in 2003 

under current bermuda law the company is not required to pay any taxes in bermuda on its income profits or capital gains the following table reconciles the income tax expense in these financial statements to that which would be expected at the us federal statutory income tax rate 

 1 the year ended december 31 2003 includes the income tax benefit of 35 million arising from the changes in uk tax legislation referred to above 57 

the significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classifications are as follows 

 at december 31 2004 the company had a valuation allowance of 123 million 2003 114 million to reduce its deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value the valuation allowance relates to the deferred tax assets arising from uk tax operating loss carryforwards and uk capital loss carryforwards both of which have no expiration date uk tax operating loss carryforwards can only be used against income arising in certain uk subsidiaries in addition the capital loss carryforwards can only be offset against future uk capital gains 

at december 31 2004 the company had deferred tax assets of 254 million 2003 194 million net of the valuation allowance management believes based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse and prudent and feasible taxplanning strategies it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences net of the valuation allowance however the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised in the event that the valuation allowance of 123 million at december 31 2004 2003 114 million is reduced in future years to recognize deferred tax assets an amount of up to 87 million 2003 81 million will be allocated to reduce goodwill 

the company recognizes a deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments the company does not however provide for income taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other subsidiaries where in managements opinion such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in those operations or will be remitted either in a tax free liquidation or as dividends with taxes substantially offset by foreign tax credits it is not practical to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments 

5 investments in associates 

the company holds a number of investments which it accounts for using the equity method the companys interest in the outstanding stock of the more significant associates is as follows 

 1 on january 1 2004 the company acquired the remaining 70 percent in willis as see note 3 2 on june 1 2004 the company acquired a further 20 percent in herzfeld  levy sa now herzfeld willis sa see note 3 3 on september 1 2004 the company acquired a 50 percent shareholding in shanghai pudong insurance brokers limited since renamed willis pudong insurance brokers co limited based in shanghai china of those listed above the companys principal investment as of december 31 2004 and 2003 is gras savoye frances leading insurance broker included in the carrying amount of the gras savoye investment is goodwill of 72 million net of accumulated goodwill amortization of 7 million as of both december 31 2004 and 2003 as of december 31 2004 and 2003 the companys other investments in associates individually and in the aggregate were not material to the companys operations

 6 net income per share

10 stock benefit plans 

the company has adopted the plans described below providing for the grant of timebased options and performancebased options and various other sharebased grants to employees the objectives of these plans include attracting and retaining the best personnel motivating management personnel by means of growthrelated incentives to achieve longrange goals and providing employees with the opportunity to increase their share ownership in the company 

  amended and restated 1998 share purchase and option plan —this plan which was established on december 18 1998 provides for the granting of timebased and performancebased options to employees of the company there are 30000000 shares available for grant under this plan provided however that in no event the total number of shares subject to options and other equity for current and future participants exceed 25 percent of the equity of willis group holdings on a fully diluted basis all options granted under this plan are exercisable at £2 per share 384 using the yearend exchange rate of £1  192 except for 111111 timebased options which are exercisable at 1350 no further grants are to be made under this plan 

timebased options are earned upon the fulfilment of vesting requirements options are generally exercisable in equal instalments of 20 percent per year over a fiveyear period commencing on or after december 18 2000 

performancebased options became exercisable subject to the fulfilment of vesting requirements with effect from january 1 2003 upon the achievement of cash flow and ebitda as defined in the plan agreements targets of willis group limited options are generally exercisable in equal instalments of 25 percent per year over a fouryear period commencing on or after december 18 2001 

  willis award plan —this plan which was established on july 13 2000 provides for the granting of timebased options to selected employees who have been identified as superior performers there are 5000000 shares available for grant under this plan provided however that in no event the total number of shares subject to options and other equity for current and future participants exceed 25 percent of the equity of willis group holdings on a fully diluted basis all options granted under this plan are exercisable at £2 per share 384 using the yearend exchange rate of £1  192 the options vest immediately on the grant date and are exercisable any time up to july 13 2010 

  2001 share purchase and option plan —this plan which was established on may 3 2001 provides for the granting of timebased options and various other sharebased grants at fair market value to employees of the company there are 15000000 shares available for grant under this plan options are exercisable on a variety of dates including from the first third sixth or eighth anniversary of grant although for certain options the exercisable date may accelerate depending on the achievement of certain performance goals unless terminated sooner by the board of directors the 2001 plan will expire 10 years after its adoption that termination will not affect the validity of any grant outstanding at that date 

  compensation expense —willis group holdings applies the intrinsic value method allowed by apb 25 in accounting for its stock option plans under apb 25 compensation expense resulting from awards under fixed plans timebased options options granted pursuant to the willis award plan and various other sharebased grants to employees are measured as the difference between the quoted or best estimate of market price and the exercise price on the measurement date all fixed plan options have been granted by willis group holdings at an exercise price equal to the quoted market price at the measurement date or managements best estimate of market price prior to the initial public 

offering accordingly pursuant to apb 25 no compensation expense has been recognized for fixed option plans in the statements of operations 

compensation expense resulting from awards under variable plans performancebased options is measured as the difference between the quoted market price and the exercise price at the date when the number of shares is known the date the performance conditions are satisfied the cost is recognized over the period the employee performs related services estimates of compensation expense were recorded before the measurement date based on the quoted market price of the shares at the intervening dates in situations where it was probable that the performance conditions would be attained 

management determined in the third quarter of 2001 that it was probable that the maximum performance condition would be attained the measurement date under apb 25 was december 31 2002 accordingly compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2004 of 11 million 8 million net of tax 2003 20 million 16 million net of tax 2002 80 million 67 million net of tax was recognized based on the 109 million 2003 109 million 2002 111 million unforfeited performance options outstanding at that date a quoted market price of 2867 2003 2867 2002 2867 and an average elapsed performance period of 100 percent 2003 95 percent 2002 85 percent 

the pro forma disclosures required by sfas 123r in note 2 were estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions 

 the compensation expense as generated by the blackscholes model may not be indicative of the future benefit if any that may be received by the option holder 

the blackscholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable in addition option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions because willis group holdings employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate in managements opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options 

stock option transactions under the plans are as follows 

 1 certain options are exercisable at £2 per share yearend exchange rates of £1  192 £1  179 and £1  161 have been used as of december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively a summary of timebased options outstanding and exercisable at december 31 2004 is as follows 

 the weightedaverage remaining contractual life of performancebased options outstanding at december 31 2004 was four years 

11 financial instruments 

the companys principal financial instruments other than derivatives comprise bank loans the new senior credit facility cash deposits and shortterm investments the company also enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts in order to manage interest rate and currency risks arising from the companys operations and its sources of finance the company does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes 

the main risks arising from the companys financial instruments are interest rate risk liquidity risk foreign currency risk and credit risk the companys board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks as summarized below the company has applied sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 149 in accounting for these financial instruments 

  interest rate risk —in 2004 the companys operations were financed principally through the senior credit facility note 8 as of december 31 2004 450 million was drawn down under the new senior credit facility interest rate swaps were used to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the companys exposure to interest rate fluctuations willis north america entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements on june 4 2004 under which the liborbased variable rate interest payment obligations on the full amount of the term loans were swapped for fixed rate interest payment obligations until 2006 

the company designated these interest rate swap agreements as a cash flow hedge as defined by sfas 133 with the fair value recorded in other liabilities on the balance sheet changes in fair value were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income as shown in the table below amounts were reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affected earnings the differential paid or received was recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as incurred 

as a result of the companys operating activities the company receives cash for premiums and claims which it deposits in shortterm investments denominated in us dollars and other currencies the company earns interest on these funds which is included in the companys financial statements as interest income these funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested most of which are shortterm in maturity in order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets the company enters into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest fixed in the various currencies related to the shortterm investments the use of interest rate contracts essentially converts groups of shortterm investments to fixed rates 

the fair value of these contracts is recorded in other assets and other liabilities for contracts that are qualifying cash flow hedges as defined by sfas 133 changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings for contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting as defined by sfas 133 changes in fair value are recorded in general and administrative expenses 

the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments have been recorded as follows 

 a summary of the companys interest rate swaps by major currency is as follows 

 1 notional amounts represent us dollar equivalents translated at the spot rate as of december 31   liquidity risk —the companys objective is to ensure that it has the ability to generate sufficient cash either from internal or external sources in a timely and costeffective manner to meet its commitments as they fall due the companys management of liquidity risk is embedded within its overall risk management framework scenario analysis is continually undertaken to ensure that the companys resources can meet its liquidity requirements these resources are supplemented by a 150 million revolving credit facility which expires on december 4 2008 of which no amount is currently drawn 

  foreign currency risk —the companys objective is to maximize its cash flow in us dollars in all locations with the exception of the united kingdom the company predominantly generates revenues and expenses in the local currency in the united kingdom however the company earns revenues in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely in pounds sterling this mismatch creates a currency exposure 

the companys policy within the united kingdom is to convert into sterling all revenues arising in currencies other than us dollars together with sufficient us dollar revenues to fund the remaining sterling expenses outside the united kingdom only those cash flows necessary to fund mismatches between revenues and expenses are converted into local currency amounts remitted to the united kingdom are generally converted into sterling these transactional currency exposures are principally managed by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts 

the fair value of these contracts is recorded in other assets and other liabilities for contracts that are qualifying cash flow hedges as defined by sfas 133 changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings for contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting as defined by sfas 133 changes in fair value are recorded in general and administrative expenses see table above on previous page 

the table below summarizes by major currency the contractual amounts of the companys forward contracts to exchange foreign currencies for pounds sterling foreign currency notional amounts are reported in us dollars translated at spot rates at december 31 

 1 forward exchange contracts range in maturity from 2005 to 2007   credit risk and concentrations of credit risk —credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the company does not anticipate nonperformance by counterparties the company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk however it is the companys policy to enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties as practical 

concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value the company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of high quality financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the company does business as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the companys concentrations of credit as of december 31 2004 

  fair value —the estimated fair value of the companys financial instruments held or issued to finance the companys operations is summarized below certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts the fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company would realize upon disposition nor do they indicate the companys intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument 

 the following methods and assumptions were used by the company in estimating its fair value disclosure for financial instruments 

  cash and cash equivalents —the estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying values due to their short maturities 

  fiduciary funds—restricted and shortterm investments —fair values are based on quoted market values 

  longterm debt —the estimated fair values of the companys longterm debt are based on current interest rates available to the company for debt instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities 

  derivative financial instruments —market values have been used to determine the fair value of interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts based on estimated amounts the company would receive or have to pay to terminate the agreements taking into account the current interest rate environment or current foreign currency forward rates 

12 supplemental disclosures of cash flow information 

supplemental disclosures regarding cash flow information and noncash flow investing and financing activities are as follows 

 13 accumulated other comprehensive loss 

the components of comprehensive income are as follows 

 74 

the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows

14 commitments and contingencies 

  operating leases —the company leases certain land buildings and equipment under various operating lease arrangements original noncancellable lease terms typically are between 10 and 20 years and may contain escalation clauses along with options that permit early withdrawal the total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the lease 

as of december 31 2004 the aggregate future minimum rental commitments under all noncancellable operating lease agreements are as follows 

 in november 2004 the company entered into a 25 year agreement with long time client british land plc relating to its new uk headquarters in london construction is scheduled to commence in early 2005 and the companys occupancy is targeted for late 2007 the companys contractual obligations in relation to this commitment total 893 million and are included in the table above but remain contingent upon the successful completion of construction 

rent expense amounted to 87 million 70 million and 71 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the companys rental income from subleases was 9 million 8 million and 9 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  guarantees —guarantees issued by certain of willis group holdings subsidiaries with respect to the senior credit facility are discussed elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements 

certain of willis group holdings subsidiaries have given the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the company in the united kingdom and the united states guarantees in respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding the lease the operating lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to 1050 million and 158 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

in addition the company has given guarantees to bankers and other third parties relating principally to letters of credit amounting to 9 million and 9 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  put and call options relating to subsidiaries and associates —for certain subsidiaries and associates the company has the right to purchase shares a call option from coshareholders at various dates in the future in addition the coshareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell a put option their shares to the company at various dates in the future generally the exercise price of such puts and calls is formulabased using revenues and earnings and is designed to reflect fair value based on current projections of profitability and exchange rates the potential amount payable in 2005 from these options is not expected to exceed 376 million of this balance 368 million relates to gras savoye as disclosed in note 5 

  claims lawsuits and other proceedings —the company is subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business similar to other corporations the company is also subject to a variety of other claims including those relating to the companys employment practices some of those claims lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could if assessed be significant 

most of these claims lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance in respect of selfinsured deductibles the company has established provisions against these items which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and the company adjusts such provisions from time to time according to developments on the basis of current information the company does not expect that the actual claims lawsuits and other proceedings including the proceedings relating to contingent compensation arrangements referred to below to which the company is subject or of which it is aware will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flow nonetheless given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions and the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could from time to time have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 

  proceedings relating to contingent compensation arrangements —beginning in april 2004 the new york attorney general issued subpoenas to a number of insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms including the company these subpoenas requested information regarding among other things arrangements pursuant to which insurers compensated insurance brokers for distribution and other services provided to insurers the new york department of insurance also requested information concerning these compensation arrangements in october 2004 the new york attorney general filed 

suit against one of the insurance brokers accusing that broker of steering clients to insurers with which it has these compensation agreements and of soliciting false or fictitious quotes from insurers the ny ag complaint the new york attorney general has stated publicly that he has broadened his investigation of the insurance industry to cover other practices and other possible violations of law including violations of fiduciary duty securities laws and antitrust laws the new york attorney general has also publicly stated that civil and criminal charges may be filed against both individuals and other industry participants after the new york attorney general commenced his investigation insurance commissioners and attorneys general of other states announced that they are conducting similar investigations and have issued subpoenas to a number of insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms including the company the company has received requests for documents and information from eighteen other states and the district of columbia the company is cooperating fully with these investigations and is producing documents and other information in response to these subpoenas the company has engaged in discussions with representatives of the new york attorney generals office and of other states insurance commissioners and attorneys general about their investigations the company cannot predict at this time how or when those investigations will be resolved 

in august 2004 a state court proceeding was commenced against the company in california by an organization purporting to act in a representative capacity on behalf of the california general public the complaint alleges that the compensation arrangements between the company and insurance carriers constitute deceptive trade practices and it seeks both injunctive and equitable relief including restitution that action was dismissed in december 2004 a purported class action also was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york naming various insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms including the company as defendants the complaint alleges conduct by the defendants similar to the conduct alleged in the ny ag complaint and also alleges among other things the existence of a conspiracy among the insurance carriers and brokers whereby they have engaged in violations of the federal rico statute similar purported class actions also have been filed against various insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms including the company in the united states district courts for the northern district of illinois and the northern district of california and in the florida state court and it is expected that further lawsuits may be filed the actions filed in federal court will be transferred to the united states district court for the district of new jersey for coordinated pretrial proceedings the company disputes these allegations and intends to defend itself vigorously against these actions 

the compensation arrangements which were initially the subject of the investigation by the new york attorney general are a longstanding and common practice within the insurance industry and have been disclosed by the company for many years on october 21 2004 the company announced that it was voluntarily abolishing these compensation arrangements immediately in north america and by december 31 2004 outside north america it is not possible at this time to predict or reasonably estimate what the outcome or the timing of any resolution of these proceedings or any possible future proceedings may be
